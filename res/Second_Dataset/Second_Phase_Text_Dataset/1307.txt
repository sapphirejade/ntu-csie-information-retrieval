CLINICAL:
(L) breast cancer with +ve axillary LN - wire guided excision + axillary dissection.
[45F77459 - IDC].  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left breast; short stitch superior, long stitch lateral, medial stitch medial" consists of a piece of breast tissue withthree stitches as described on the label measuring 77mm (lateral to medial) x 60mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  A guide wire is seen going through the specimen with both of its tips outside the specimen.  Margins are inked in three colours:  Superior red, superficial green and deep black.  Specimen is serially sliced from lateral to medial into ten slices.  There is a pale indurated tumour present in slices 6 to 8 measuring 14 x 23 x 22mm.  The tumour is 25mm from lateral, 12mm from medial, 7mm from superior, 2mm from inferior, 5mm from superficial margins.  It appears to abut the deep margin.  
Blocks:  1 - slice 1 (lateral margin); 2 & 3 - slice 2; 4 to 6 - slice 3; 7 to 10 - slice 4; 11 to 14 - slice 6; 15 to 18 - slice 7 (block 17 - ER, PR, HER-2, KI67 requested); 19 to 22 - slice 8; 23 to 26 - slice 9;  27 & 28 - slice 10 en face (medial margin).  Please see the diagram and the x-rays.  
B.Specimen labelled "New inferior margin stitch at margin" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 45 x 40 x 15mm.  There is a stitch on one surface marking the new inferior margin (inked green).  The other surface is left uninked.  Specimen is serially sliced.  No indurated nodules are seen.  AE 8 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Axillary clearance left breast" consists of an unorientated piece of fibrofatty tissue, 80 x 70 x 60mm.  Specimen issliced.  There are several lymph nodes within the specimen.  Some of which are indurated.  The largest lymph node is 33mm in maximum dimension and is indurated. 
Blocks:  1- representative from the indurated lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one bisected lymph node; 5 - one bisected lymph node; 6 - one bisected lymph node; 7 - one lymph node; 8 - one trisected lymph node; 9 - one lymph node.  (TO: SG  MR/mm 27.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr M Martiniz):
A.  Sections show a grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), Bloom and Richardson score 9 (t = 3, n = 3, m = 3).  The IDC is poorly circumscribed and is present in slices 6 to 10 (5 slices).  The estimated tumour size is 35mm (medial-lateral) x 30mm (superior-inferior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  The superficial margin is positive in two (2) of the slices and the deep margin is close (clearance 0.6mm).  IDC also infiltrates close to the medial margin with tumour present in the most medial slice (slice 10).  However, the IDC 'cuts out' on levelling through this slice and the estimated clearance is 1mm.  The superior and inferior margins are both 4mm clear and the lateral margin is well clear (no tumour in slices 1 to 5).
There is a modest amount of high grade DCIS (solid, cribriform, comedo) confined to the IDC but not outside of it.  There is no DCIS close tothe excision margins.
B.  The new inferior margin has been totally blocked and there is no DCIS or IDC.
C.  One (1) of the nine (9) left axillary nodes identified is almost totally replaced by IDC.  There is a minor degree of perinodal spread.
