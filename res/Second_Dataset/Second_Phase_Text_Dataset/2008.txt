CLINICAL:
Grade 2endometrial cancer at curettage, superficial tumour.  Thyroid - currently on thyroxine.  Mismatch repair genes required.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries and cervix" consists of auterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 80.8g.  The uterus measures 75 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is a papillary friable tumour located in the posterior endometrium, measuring 35 x 30mm. The tumour is present in the fundus and extends to the body.  Further sections through the specimen show that the lesion is invading myometrium to a depth of 7mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 13mm.  There are three leiomyomas in the anterior myometrium ranging from 5-12mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  There is a clip onthe proximal tube.  The right ovary measures 30 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 30mm in length and 6mm in diameter.  There is a clip on the proximal tube.  The left ovary measures 20 x 10x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3- full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - representative section of tumour with possible deepest invasion; 9 - representative sections of right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 10 & 11 - right ovary; 12 - representative section of left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 13  - left ovary.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left genital wart" consists of two tan nodules 3 to 4mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: WN  EG/mm 19.11.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr F Skillicorn): 
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  There is myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 7mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 15mm.  There is focal lymphovascular invasion.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  
Immunostains for mismatch repair enzymes have been performed on the endometrial tumour.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining. 
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.  
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.  
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.  
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI). 
B.  Sections show fibroepithelial polyps.  There is no dysplasia and no good evidence ofwart virus infection is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  
-  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  Stage 1A.  
B.  Left genital tissue:  
-  Fibroepithelial polyps.
