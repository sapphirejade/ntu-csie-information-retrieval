ADDITIONAL REPORT (3.3.63)

CLINICAL:
Right breast Ca wide excision + SLN bx.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 2187" consists of apiece of fatty tissue, 30 x 20 x 8mm containing a lymph node, 15 x 8 x 7mm.  
Blocks:  1- one trisected lymph node.  Sentinel node protocol requested.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node N2288" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 25 x 15 x 7mm containing a lymph node, 10 x 5 x 4mm.  
Blocks:  1- one trisected lymph node.  Sentinel node protocol requested.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right breast mass, short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches as described ion the label measuring 45mm (lateral to medial) x 44mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  The margins are inked in three colours:  Superior red, superficial green and deep black.  Specimen is serially sliced from medial to lateral into seven slices.  There is a pale indurated nodule extending from slice 4 to slice 7 measuring21 x 17 x 16mm.  The nodule is 12mm from medial, 1mm from lateral, 3mm from superficial, 3mm from deep and12mm from superior margins.  It abuts the inferior margin.  
Blocks:  1 - slice 1 en face (medial margin); 2 to 4 - slice 2; 5to 8 - slice 3; 9 to 12 - slice 4; 13 to 16 - slice 5; 17 to 20 - slice 6 (block 15 - ER, PR, HER-2 Ki67 requested, 17- reserved block); 21 to 27 - slice 7 (lateral margin).  AE.  Please see diagram.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Axillary node (R)" consists of two lymph nodes, 12 and 10mm in maximum dimension with attached fatty tissue.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Axillary tissue" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 40 x 35 x 7mm.  No lymph nodes are seen.  AE 2 blocks.  (TO:  TD:  CU/mm 27.3.63)

ADDITIONAL REPORT, HER2 IN-SITU HYBRIDISATION (3/3/63)

Signal Detection has been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche). 

HER2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (nonamplified, diploid) 

Mean HER2 copy number percell: 1.7 
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 1.4 
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.2 

SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations): 
Negative: HER2/CEP17 < 1.8 
Equivocal: HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2 
Positive: HER2/CEP17 >2.2
