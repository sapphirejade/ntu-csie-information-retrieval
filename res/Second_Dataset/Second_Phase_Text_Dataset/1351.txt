CLINICAL:
Ultra lowrectal tumour.  Rectal Ca and distal donut.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Ultra low anterior resection" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 210mm in length x 500mm in open diameter.  There is attached mesocolon and a segment of peritoneal reflection measuring 40mm from the distal surgical margin (inked black).  On opening there is a tumour on the right lateral wall measuring 30 x 30mm.  The tumour is tan and exophytic with a centre area of necrosis.  The tumour is 5mm from the distal surgical margin, 200mm from the proximal surgical margin and 15mm from the closest radial margin.   The tumour is immediately below the level of the peritoneal reflection.  The mucosa appears flattened up to 90mm from the distal surgical margin (Normal rectal mucosa).  No polyps are identified.  Above 90mm to the proximal surgical margin the bowel mucosa appears unremarkable.  On sectioning the tumour appears to be bounded by the muscularis propria.   
Blocks: 1 - proximal surgical margin; 2 - distal surgicalmargin and closest margin to tumour; 3 to 7 - tumour; 8 - tumour and normal rectal mucosa proximally; 9 - normal bowel mucosa away from tumour; 10 to 14 - lymph nodes below peritoneal resection; 15 - ?apical lymph node; 16 & 17 - lymph nodes above peritoneal reflection.  (IU/ta 6/2/63)  18 to 20 - lymph nodes from above the peritoneal reflection; 21 to 27 - further lymph nodes from below peritoneal reflection. (HO/vo 12.2.63) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a stapled donut of bowel measuring 18 x 15 x 5mm.   Representative sections 2 blocks.   (US/ta 6/2/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Lois):
A & B.  Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum.  The features are as follows:

Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
The distal donut (specimen B) shows no significant abnormality.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2	nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
