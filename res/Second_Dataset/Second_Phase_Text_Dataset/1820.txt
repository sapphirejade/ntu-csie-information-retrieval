DR FREDRIC Russ Jex
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Rt breast Ca (central) - mastectomy + SLNBx.  Sutures: short stitch superior, long lateral.  Extra inferolateral flap (stitch lateral).  Extra superlateral flap (stitch lateral)
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary sentinel node", consists of a lymph node 15 x 10 x 5mm imprints made.  AE 1 block.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
No tumour seen
Reported by Dr S Gayheart at 16:05pm on 10.10.13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch long lateral, short superior", consists of a mastectomy measuring 190mm (medial to lateral) x 170mm (inferior to superior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  There is an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 170mm (medial to lateral) x 70mm (inferior to superior).  This includes a nipple areolar complex 30 x 30mm which appears unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  In the 9 to 10 o'clock position 15mmfrom the nipple there is a firm cream relatively well circumscribed lesion measuring 22mm (medial to lateral) x 20mm (inferior to superior) x 17mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is as follows: deep margin 20mm, inferior superficial margin 16mm, superior superficial margin 45mm and well clear of both the medial and lateral margins.  No other suspicious areas are identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full face of tumour including skin deep margin and superficial inferior margin; 6 - nipple; 7 - full face of tumour to deep margin; 8 and 9 - representative upper outer quadrant; 10 and 11 - representative inner lower quadrant; 12 and 13 - representativeouter upper quadrant; 14 and 15 - representative outer lower quadrant; 16 - reserved block.
C.Specimen labelled "Inferior lateral flap stitch lateral", consists of an orientated ellipse of skin measuring 100 x 18 to a depth of 22mm.  On one point of the ellipse there is a suture marking lateral designated 9 o'clock.  The 12o'clock margin is inked blue and the 6 o'clock margin is inked black.  The skin appears unremarkable.  No suspicious areas are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - TS of 3 o'clock margin; 2 to 6 - representative transverse sections from 12 to 6 o'clock; 7 - TS of 9 o'clock margin.
D.  Specimenlabelled "Superior lateral flap stitch lateral", consists of an orientated ellipse of skin 100 x 15 to a depth of 30mm with a suture attached to one pole marking lateral designated 9 o'clock.  The 12 o'clock (superior) margin is inked blue and the 6 o'clock (inferior) margin is inked black.  No suspicious areas are identified.  Blocks: 1 - TS of 3 o'clock margin; 2 to 6 - representative TS from 12 to 6 o'clock; 7 9 o'clock margin.  (SB/vo 13.12.63)
