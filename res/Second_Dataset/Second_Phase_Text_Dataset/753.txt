Endometrioid grade 1 on D&C.  Smoker 40/year pack history.  Obesity BMI 31.  T cell disorder.  Irritable bowel symptoms. Endometrial cancer.  Mismatch repair gene IHC.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 65g total.  The uterus and cervix is received opened along the right lateral wall.  The uterus and cervix is 70 x 50 x 25mm.  The ectocervix is 35 x30mm and appears unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube is 60mm in length and 5mm diameter.  The left ovary is 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube is 60mm in length and 5mm diameter.  The right ovary is 25 x 12 x 8mm.  Within the body and fundus of the uterus is an exophytic tan tumour, 25 x 25 x 20mm.  The tumour is 25mm clear of the ectocervix.  The tumour in the posterior wall appears to infiltrate to a depth of 6mm, with a total myometrial thickness of 12mm.  On the left fallopian tube are three pale cystic nodules, each 3mm across.  On the right fallopian tube is a metal surgical clip in keeping with previous tubal ligation.   Otherwise the adnexae are unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - mid line sagittal section from cervix to fundus anterior wall; 4 to 6 - mid line sagittal section from cervix to fundus posterior wall; 7 to 11 - remainder of anterior endometrial cavity from right toward left; 12 to 17 - remainder of posterior endometrial cavity from right towards left; 18 - right ovary and fallopian; 19 - left ovary and fallopian tube
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 50 x 40x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 25mm across.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - one lymph node bisected in each block; 3 and 4 - multiple lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator", consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 60 x 40 x 20mm.  Two possible lymph nodes are identified, 15 and 20mm.  
Blocks: 1and 2 - one lymph node bisected in each block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 55 x 40 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 15mm across. 
Blocks: 1 and 2 - one lymph node bisected in each block; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - multiple lymph nodes.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 45x 20 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 20mm.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - one lymph node in each block; 3 - two lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Thalls):
A. Sections show an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 1, of the endometrium.  The lesion has a complex glandular and papillary architecture, and is composed of columnar tumour cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia.  There is no evidence of a significant solid component. There is no evidence of severe nuclear atypia, in keeping with a grade of 1. 
There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
the deepest point of invasion the tumour has invaded 8mm into a wall 15mm thick (A6).
Adenomyosis is present in the myometrium.
The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect, CIN or malignancy.
The fallopian tubes and ovaries show no evidence of malignancy.
Shown to Dr Melvin Redcay. 
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B. Sections show 7 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
	Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 1 of the endometrium
	Maximum depth of invasion: 8 mm into a wall 15 mm thick
	No evidence of lymphovascular invasion
	Cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries show no evidence of malignancy

B to E. Left and right external iliac, left and right obturator lymph nodes:
- 17 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
