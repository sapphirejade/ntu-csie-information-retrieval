CLINICAL:
Ivor Lewis Oesophagectomy.  Oesophageal adenoca.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Oesophagus + stomach" consists of a distal oesophagus (46mm in length) and proximal stomach (70mm along the greater curvature).  There is patchy attached fatty tissue surrounding theoesophagus and parts of stomach.  The circumferential margin is inked blue.  There is a polypoid tumour within the distal oesophagus and involving the oesophago-gastric junction.  It is mostly centred in the right posterior wall of the distal oesophagus, just above the oesophago-gastric junction, but also involves the junction.  It measures 38mm long x 25mm wide and 24mm in height.  It involves  2/3  of the circumference of the distal oesophagus.  The tumour is 11mm from the proximal oesophageal margin and is well clear of the distal gastric margin.  Specimen is serially transversely sliced and circumferential slices of the oesophagus are blocked from proximal to distal.  No lesions are identifiedwithin the stomach.  A few lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - paired sections shave proximal margin; 3 & 4 - paired sections one TS; 5 to 7 - one transverse sliced; 8 to 10 - one transverse sliced; 11 to 13 - one transverse sliced; 14 to 16 - one transverse sliced; 17 to 19 - one transverse sliced; 20 - representative LS distal gastric margin; 21 - ?lymph nodes as seen; 22 - one bisected lymph node; 23to 25 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Greater omentum + spleen" consists of omental fatty tissue 170 x 100 x 50 and detached spleen 110 x 80 x 35mm.  The external surface of thespleen is focally roughened over an area measuring 60 x 45mm (inked blue).  No discrete nodules are seen within the spleen.  The omental fatty tissue is sliced and examined for lymph nodes.  A few likely lymph nodes are identified (block2).
Blocks:  1 -representative spleen, the roughened surface; 2 - ?lymph nodes as seen; 3 to 7 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes.  (TO: QM; SQ/rt 21.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Berlinski):
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated (grade 2)adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus and involving the oesophagogastric junction.  It has an expansile pattern of growth.  It forms a polypoid mass and mainly involves the mucosa but does invade into the submucosa of the oesophagus (blocks A14, A17).  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified and no perineuralinvasion is seen.  The tumour arises in Barrett's mucosa which shows high grade dysplasia.
The proximal and distal margins are free of tumour.  Changes of Barrett's mucosa focally extend to the proximal margin but the mucosa at the margin does not show dysplasia.  Sections of stomach away from the tumour show features of a mild chronic superficial gastritis; no Helicobacter is identified with a giemsa stain.
A total of three lymph nodes were identified in the attached fat and these are all free of tumour.
B.  Sections of the spleen are unremarkable.  Sections of the omental fat are unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified in the several sections of omentum which were taken.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Oesophagus and stomach:
1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of distal oesophagus invading submucosa.  No lymph node metastases (0/3).  pT1b  N0.
2.  Barrett's oesophagus.
B.  Greater omentum and spleen:  No abnormality seen.
