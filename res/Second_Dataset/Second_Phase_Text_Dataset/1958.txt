CLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma on curettings.  Enlarged cervix.  PMB.  Obesity BMI 35.  Gout.  Renal calculi.  Hypercholesterolemia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 22.5g in total.  The uterus measures 115 x 70 x 40mm and has an unremarkable serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and appears dull grey in colour.  The anterior aspect is inked blue and posterior is inked black.  On sectioning the endometrium measures 2mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium measures 15mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains an infiltrative tumour penetrating through the full thickness of the myometrium and extending into the cervix. The tumour appears to infiltrate the full length ofthe cervix and extend to the radial cervical margin. The tumour measures 85mm in maximum length. In addition, there are two fibroids at the fundus of the uterus measuring 35mm in maximum diameter and 40mm in diameter.   The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 6mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 28 x 15 x 6mm and appears unremarkable on cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 7mm in maximum external dimension.  The left ovary measures 27 x 17 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - fulllongitudinal sections of posterior body and cervix; 9 and 10 - representative section of the first fibroid; 11 and 12 - representative section the second fibroid; 13 - right ovary and tube; 14 - left ovary and tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 30 x 6mm consists of five lymph nodes ranging from 5mm across to 15mm across.
Blocks:  1 - three nodes; 2 to 3 - one node in each block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of 45 x 30 x 15mm, nine possible lymph nodes identified ranging from 20mm across to 3mm across.
Blocks:  1 - four nodes; 2to 3 - one node in each block; 4 - three nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of fragments of fibrofatty tissue 55 x 45 x 20mm.  Four possible lymph nodes identified ranging from 30mm across to 5mm across.
Blocks:  1 - two nodes; 2 - one node; 3 - one node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator node", consists of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 30 x 10mm.  Four lymph nodes identified ranging from 45mm across to 6mm across.
Blocks:  1 - three nodes; 2 to 3 - the largest node.  (AX/rt 29.10.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Mciver & registrar Dr O Garcias):
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, with the solid component of the tumour just falling short of 50%.  The tumour invades almostthe full thickness of the myometrium, 14.8mm out of a wall thickness of 15mm.  Focal lymphovascular and perineural invasion are present.There is extensive tumour involvement of the cervix with tumour extending to the cervical resection margin.  Tumour also extends into peri-cervical adipose tissue and involves the cervical radial resection margin over a broad front.  Themyometrium shows leiomyomas.  Both ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. 
B.  The five lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The nine lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  The four lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One of the four lymph nodes identified shows metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma measuring at least 8mm across with extranodal spread.  Lymphovascular invasion is seen within the adjacent adipose tissue.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - E.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, pelvic lymph nodes:
- Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium
- Almost full thickness invasionof the myometrium
- Focal lymphovascular and perineural invasion present
- Cervical longitudinal and radial resection margins positive
- One positive lymph node.
