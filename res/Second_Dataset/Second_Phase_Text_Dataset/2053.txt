L testicular tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left testis + cord", consists of a testis with attached spermatic cord.  The spermatic cord measures 85mm in length with an outer diameter of 20mm.  Testis measures 60mm x 40mm x 28mm and weighs 56g in total.  The tunica vaginales strips of easily.  The cut surface shows a pale tan brown ill-defined lesion measuring 20mm x 18mm x 15mm.  Tumour is clear of tunica albicans.  No macroscopic evidence of tumour invasion into rete testis and epididymis.  The rest of the testis is yellowish/golden.
Blocks: 1 - spermatic cord resection margin; 2 - mid spermatic chord transverse section; 3 - base of spermatic cord; 4 to 19 - tumour (block 5 to 12 - full face of tumour,13, 14, 15, and 16 full profile of tumour); 17 to 19 - tumour; 20 - tumour relation to tunica albicans; 21 - RS of normal testis; 22 - reserved block for biobank.
