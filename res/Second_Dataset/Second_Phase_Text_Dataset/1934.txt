HISTORY:  Ca.  Liver mets.  Peritonectomy performed. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  'LIVER LESION'.  A segment of liver weighing 12g and measuring 35x32x12mm.  Capsular surface is noted with central disruption.  Resection margin inked black.  On the cut surface an area of ?necrosis measuring 10x8x10mm is noted deep to the disrupted capsule.  This area is well away from the resection margin.  (1and2, 3and4 RS TS with lesion bisected; 5 another section of the lesion).  RS (5-5)
B.  'OMENTUM, ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS'.  A segment of small bowel measuring 620mm in length with maximum diameter of 20mm.  The serosal surface of the small bowel is dull and dusky with multiple serosal adhesions and narrowed lumen without complete obstruction.  A piece of fatty tissue (?omentum) measuring 170x120x50mm is adherent to the serosal surface of the small bowel.  Mesentery is noted measuring 300x80x30mm.  Segment of colon measuring 110mm in length with maximum diameter of 40mm is present with a probable side to side anastomosis.  400mm away from the small bowel margin, the mucosal surface shows a small lesion measuring 20mm in maximum extent with focal narrowing of the lumen calibre.  The remainder of the small bowel and colonic mucosa is unremarkable.  Two lymph nodes, the largest measuring 25mm in maximum extent is noted within the mesentery.  The cut surface of the omentum is unremarkable. 
(1 LS small bowel margin; 2 LS colonic margin; 3and4 TS anastomosis; 5-7 TS of the small bowel with mucosal lesion; 8-10 RS TS of serosal adhesion of small bowel;
Also received, multiple fragments of fatty tissue (?Omentum) measuring in aggregate 200x200x50mm.  The cut surface is mostly fatty.  No lesions identified. 
11and12 RS sections of omentum).  RS (M-12/YI/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  
A.  Sections of the rounded nodule in liver showan encysted area of necrosis surrounded by a foreign body giant cell reaction and a fibrous capsule.  The nature of the necrotic tissue is uncertain.  The lesion is clear of margins. The adjacent liver shows non-specific reactive changes.
B.  Present within the wall of the loop of small bowel, there is an area of recurrent (?metastatic) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin in the appropriate clinical setting.  The tumour is ulcerated and extends into adjacent attached fatty tissue and is very close to an overlying area of attached liver tissue (approximately 1mm from the liver surface).  Within adjacent fatty tissue, there is a separate rounded nodule of largely necrotic adenocarcinoma with a fibrous capsule, with an adjacent lymph node.  The cut ends of bowel are free of lesions. 
Correlation with previous results recommended. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  EXCISION LIVER LESION - rounded area of encysted necrosis.
B.  EXCISION OMENTUM, ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS -
- bowel and adherent mass with deposits of recurrent (?metastatic) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with colorectal origin and in the appropriate clinical setting, with overlying adhesion to part of liver.
