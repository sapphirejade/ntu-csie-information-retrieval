CLINICAL:
Left adrenal tumour 7cm diameter.  Specimen opened at end of procedure/large cystic component.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left adrenal gland", consists of a piece of fatty tissue with attached adrenal gland measuring 90 x 75 x 35mm and weighing 47.1g in total. The specimen was received with an incision into it revealing a cystic component to the underlying tissue.  The cut surface reveals a cystic lesion expanding within the adrenalgland.  In areas there is a golden tumour identified loosely within the cystic area.  Although received opened macroscopically the resection appears complete. Representative sections in 10 blocks (approximately 50% of lesion embedded).

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Deputy)
Sections show an adrenal cyst.  The cystwall is composed of dense fibrotic tissue with focal dystrophic calcification.  No epithelial cystic lining is seen.  The cyst contains degenerated material.  Normal appearing adrenal tissue is seen adjacent to the cyst.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left adrenal gland - Adrenal cyst.
