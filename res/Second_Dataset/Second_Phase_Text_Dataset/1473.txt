CLINICAL:
Right 10 o'c IDC.
Left 1 o'c IDC.  Left sentinel node biopsy.
Right axillary node +.
Bilateral mastectomy + right axilla clearance + left axilla clearance.  Short superior, long lateral sutures.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node biopsy left breast" consists of one large node 20 x 10 x 5mm.  On sectioning there is a firm pale area.  Imprints performed.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - sentinel node.  
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
Malignant cells present.  
Phone result to Dr Luigi (anaesthetist) by Drs G Santrizos & G Chaney on 06.08.13 at 6.00pm.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast long lateral, short superior" consists of atotal mastectomy with two sutures for orientation, small superior, long lateral margins.  The specimen measures 210mm (medial to lateral), 180mm (superior to inferior), 30mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of skin with nippleand areola complex 170 x 80mm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue, the deep margin black.  On sectioning and in the upper outer quadrant there is a solid stellate white gritty tumour 15 x 15x 15mm.  It is located 20mm from the nipple, 25mm from the deep margin, 55mm from superior margin and 75mm from inferior margin.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.

Blocks:  1 to 6 - lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right axilla level 2" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 20 x 10 x 5mm containinglymph nodes 5mm each.  
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - rest of fatty tissue.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left breast" consists of a left mastectomy with two sutures for orientation, short suture superior margin and long suture lateral margin.  Specimen measures 200mm(medial to lateral), 180mm (superior to inferior) and 40mm (superficial to deep) margins.  There is an ellipse of skin with nipple and areola complex measuring 180 x 80mm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The superficial marginis inked blue, the deep margin black.  On sectioning three tumours are identified.  
Tumour 1 located in upper inner quadrant measuring 25 x 20 x 15mm, it is located 10mm from deep margin, 25mm from superficial margin, 30mm from superior margin, 105mm from inferior margin and 80mm from nipple.  
Tumour 2 is located in the junction of upper outer quadrant and lower outer quadrant.  It measures 20 x 20 x 15mm and is located 40mm from nipple, <3mm from deep margin and 25mm from superficial margin.  
Tumour 3 is located in the upper outer quadrant 15mm away from tumour 2 and measures 20 x 10 x 10mm, it is also located 5mm from deep margin, 10mm from superficial margin and 20mm from superior margin.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.  
Blocks:  1 - nipple and areola complex; 2 & 3 - composite of tumour 1 with superficial and deep margin; 4 - representative tumour 1; 5 to 7 - representative tumour 2; 8& 9 - representative sections tumour 3; 10 & 11 - representative sections lower inner quadrant; 12 & 13 - representative sections lower outer quadrant.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla level I" consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue 60 x 50 x 10mm containing seven lymph nodes 5 to 15mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 to 4 - six lymph nodes.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla level II" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 40 x 25 x 20mm containing four lymph nodes 5 to 10mm.  
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - two lymph nodes.  (CG/mm 9.10.63)
