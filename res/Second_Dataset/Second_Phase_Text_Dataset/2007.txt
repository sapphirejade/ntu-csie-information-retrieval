CLINICAL:
Left hemithyroidectomy.  3cm thyroid cyst with recurrent bleeds.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left hemithyroid" consists of a left hemithyroidectomy 40 x 35 x 20mm, weighing 5g.  The tracheal margin is inked black and the non-tracheal surface blue.  Adjacent to the thyroid gland there appears to be a unilocular cyst 28 x 12 x 10mm.The cyst wall is 1-2mm thick.  The internal surface of the cyst appears lined by haemorrhagic material.  Serially embedded from superior to inferior in 8 blocks.  AE.  (TO: CQ:  IP/mm 7.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr A Ell):
Sections show thyroid.  There is a benign cyst present which has a dense fibrous wall.  There is follicular tissue within the cyst and this has a patchy infiltrate of pigment laden macrophages, consistent with the previous haemorrhage.  Some follicular tissue within and adjacent to the cyst also shows hyperplastic changes.  
At one end of the specimen, adjacent to but apparently separate from the cyst, there is a papillary carcinoma, follicular variant.  This is present in three adjacent blocks so it is around 12mm in main diameter.  It is quite well circumscribed but is not encapsulated andshows some invasion to adjacent thyroid.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified and there is no extra thyroid spread.  It does not extend to the inked excision margins of the lobe.  Excision of the papillary carcinoma appears complete.
The lobe is otherwise unremarkable.  A small lymph node is present in fat adjacent to the lobe and this is unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left hemithyroid:
1.  Papillary carcinoma,follicular variant, 12mm diameter.
2.  Benign cyst.
