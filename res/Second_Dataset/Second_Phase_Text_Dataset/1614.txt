SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 6/12/64
FURTHER SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ATTACHED

HISTORY:  
Colorectal cancer. ?liver mets. Frozen section. Liver surface.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "LIVER SURFACE". An irregular piece of tissue, 5x4x2mm, majority embedded for F/S in two pieces (fragmented). 
F/S: "Benign fibrovascular tissue" reported by Dr Z Tvedt per phone to Everroad (fellow) at 10:15am on 4/4/14. 
AE (M-2).
B. "PERICOLECTOMY, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, UTERUS, OMENTUM".Spleen, gallbladder, uterus (body), omentum and haemorrhagic tissue. No peritoneal tissue is seen macroscopically. 
The spleen is 100x60x25mm and weighs 125g. On the external surface and extending to the superficial parenchymathere are three well-demarcated white hard nodules up to 10mm in diameter. The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable. 
The gallbladder is 95x35mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface, a wall 2mm in thickness and a green granular mucosal surface. No stones are present. 
The uterus has been ---at the isthmus and consists of a uterine body with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The right fallopian tube is 50x6mm and the right ovary 20x15x10mm weighing 2g. The left fallopian tube is 50x6mm and the left ovary 20x10x8mm weighing 3g. The uterine body is 45mm from fundus to isthmus and 40mm wide and 30mm from anterior to posterior. The endometrium is less than 1mm in thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in thickness with trabeculation present. 
The omentum is irregularly shaped and approximately 300x130x10mm. A ?metastatic nodule 15mm in diameter is present in the omentum. Two other nodules comprised of ?thrombus are also present each approximately 20mm in diameter. 
(1-3 spleen; 4 cystic duct and body; 5 fundus of gallbladder; 6 rightovary and fallopian tube; 7 left ovary and fallopian tube; 8 & 9 endometrium and resection margin; 10 endometrium and fundus; 11 ?thrombus x 2; 12 ?metastatic deposit and omentum [block 12 tumour reserve block]). RS (M-12)
C. "GASTRIC NODULES". A white nodule 5mm. AE (1-1)
D. "LIVER SEGMENT FOUR". A wedge of liver approximately 50x40x30mm which has beensliced at prior to resection and has a friable incomplete surface. The section has been closely sliced and no focal lesions are seen. RS (5-5)
E. "LIVER LESION SEGMENT B". A wedge of liver 15x15x15mm. No lesions seen. AE (4-2/IR/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Z Micek)
A. Frozen sections confirm fibrovascular tissue only. 
B. Sections of spleen confirm multiple deposits of moderately to poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. Each of the deposits abuts the splenic capsule, but no invasion throughthe capsule is seen. There are areas of central necrosis. The adjacent non-involved spleen appears unremarkable. Each of the deposits appears clear of the splenic excision margin.
Sections of gallbladder show features of mildchronic cholecystitis, with no evidence of malignancy. No metastatic deposits are identified in the gallbladder. 
Sections of right and left fallopian tube and right and left ovaries show changes consistent with age, with no evidence of involvement. 
Sections of uterus show atrophic endometrium. The myometrium and serosal surface is unremarkable. 
Sections of the omentum confirm a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with a similar appearance to those seen within the spleen. Central necrosis is present. 
C. Sections show smooth muscle consistent with muscularis propria, which merges with a cellular spindle cell nodule which appears circumscribed but unencapsulated. Within the nodule, the bland spindle cells show cigar-shaped nuclei arranged in intersecting fascicles.  This nodule is 4mm in maximal extent. There is no significant nuclear atypia, no necrosis, and no mitotic activity detected. The features raise a differential diagnosis of a small gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), versus a leiomyoma, with the appearance on the routine stain favouring a small gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Immunohistochemical stains are in progress to differentiate these two lesions, with a supplementary report to follow. 
D. Sections of liver show mild macrovesicular steatosis. No involvement by metastatic tumour is seen in the representative tissue examined.
E. The specimen has been completely embedded and examined, and no involvement by metastatic tumour is identified.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. LIVER SURFACE: 
-  FIBROVASCULAR TISSUE.
B. PERICOLECTOMY, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, UTERUS, OMENTUM: 
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA WITHIN THE SPLEEN AND OMENTUM. 
C. GASTRIC NODULE:
- A 4mm SPINDLE CELL NODULE (? GIST ?LEIOMYOMA). IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS TO CONFIRM ARE IN PROGRESS, WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT TO FOLLOW.
D. LIVER SEGMENT FOUR:
- NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.
E. LIVER LESION SEGMENT B:
- NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 6/12/64
C. Immunohistochemical stain results on 4mm spindle cell lesion.
CD117 and CD34: positive
Desminand smooth muscle actin: negative.
This immunoprofile is in keeping with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour.

Further supplementary report: 

Immunostains for MSI proteins (BorgWarner BROKEN HILL BASE HOSPITAL Lab; block: B1)
MLH1: Positive (normal) stainingof tumour cell nuclei.
PMS2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei.
MSH2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei.
MSH6: Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei.
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
