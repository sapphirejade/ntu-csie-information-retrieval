A.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with seven lymph nodes.  The largest one measuring 50 x 30 x 20mm.  The smallest one measuring 10 x 10 x 10mm. 
Blocks: 1 to 7 - one lymph node each.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal lymph node" consists of a piece of tissue measuring 70 x 70 x 10mm.  Three lymph nodes are identified measuring 10,20,and 60mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - onerepresentative section from each lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with three lymph nodes measuring 10, 10and 25mm in maximum diameter. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - representative sections with the largest lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes measuring 20 and 25mm in maximum diameter.  On sectioning they are replaced by tumour.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative sections of a lymph node each.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes" consists of two lymph nodes measuring 15and 30mm in maximum diameter.  On sectioning they are totally replaced by tumour.
