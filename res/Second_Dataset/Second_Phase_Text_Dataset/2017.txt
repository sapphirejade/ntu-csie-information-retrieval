HISTORY:  
Low-grade appendix cancer. - Peritonectomy + HI PEC.
- Peritoneum
- Liver segment 2.
- Omentum
- Gallbladder.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "PERITONEUM, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER". Gallbladder, omentum and piece of peritoneum. The gallbladder measures 60x25x10mm. The serosal of the gallbladder looks smooth and shinny. On the section,there are no gallstones identified. The serosa looks velvety. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(1 section of proximal surgical margin; 2 transverse section of the body; 3 longitudinal section of the thymus of the gallbladder).
The piece of peritoneum measures 110x35x10mm. The specimen is sectioned transversely. There is one pale, white nodular lesion identified measuring 5mm in diameter. No other lesions seen. Representative sectionsare taken and embedded.
(4&5 representative section of the peritoneum with pale nodular lesion; 6-8 another representative section of the peritoneum).
The piece of omentum measures 290x230x25mm. The omentum is sectioned transversely. On the section, there are no obvious lesions identified. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(9-16 representative sections of the omentum). RS (M-16)
B. "FNH FOCAL NODULE HYPERPLASIALIVER SEGMENT 2". Segment of liver, measuring 30x25x15mm. The specimen weighs 9g. On the section, there is pale white well-circumscribed nodular lesion identified in the specimen, measuring 15x16x15mm. The distance to the resection surgical margin from the lesion is about 3mm. The specimen is sectioned transversely. Representative sections are embedded in four blocks. 
(1-4 representative sections of the specimen). RS (M-4)
C. "PERITONEUM". Multiple pieces of fatty tissue, measuring in aggregate 50x40x20mm. On the section, there are no other lesions identified. Representative sections are taken and embedded in four blocks. 
(1-4 representative sections of the specimen). RS (M-4/ QU/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Q Kusch)
A.Sections of gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis. 
The omental biopsy shows an area of fibrosis. Occasional dilated blood vessels are identified. There are focal changes of fat necrosis. Small foci showing extravasated mucin without epithelium are identified. There is one reactive lymph node noted.  No evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show liver in which there is an ill defined lesion. Thelesion shows irregular nodules of hepatocytes bordered by bile ductal proliferation in keeping with focal nodular hyperplasia. Focal cholestasis is identified. Soft tissue margins appear clear of thelesion. 
C.  Sections show fragments of fibrofatty tissue in which there is vascular congestion. Focally, small amount of extravasated mucin is identified. There is also patchy fibrous scarring. Within the mucin, no epitheliumis identified. There are scattered multinucleated foreign body giant cells seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  PERITONEUM, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER -
- FIBROSIS WITH FOCAL EXTRAVASATED MUCIN. 
B.  FNH FOCAL NODULAR HYPERPLASIA, LIVER SEGMENT 2 -
 - FOCAL NODULAR HYPERPLASIA.  
C.  PERITONEUM - 
 - FOCAL FIBROSIS AND FOREIGNBODY GIANT CELL REACTION. 
 - EXTRAVASATED MUCIN DEPOSITION.
