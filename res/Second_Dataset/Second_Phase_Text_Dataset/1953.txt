Grade 2 endometrial cancer-10% clear cell on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node" consists of a node measuring 15 x 10 x 7mm serially sectioned in a longitudinal way.  Two sections for frozen section. 
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - rest of the specimen AE.   
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative for tumour.
Result to Dr Salvio by Dr W Tivis and Dr W Boucaud on 19/8/14 at 4:05pm.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturatorlymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 10mm containing one lymph node measuring 40 x 8 x 7mm.  Serially sectioned in a longitudinal way.  Two sections for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 to 5 - rest of the specimen AE.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative for tumour.
Result to Dr Strohbehn by Dr W Messmore and Dr W Igneri on 19/8/14 at 4:30pm.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes,ovaries, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 46g.  The uterus measuring 60 x 35 x 25mm and has a shiny smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 22 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is ragged.  The myometrium measures 12mm in maximum thickness.  An invasive lesion is present in the posterior body and measures 25 x 25mm and invades 7 out of 12mm of the myometrium.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 15 x 10 x 5mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures35mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary measures 15 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full face of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - full face of posterior body and cervix; 8 to 10 - full face body and cervix from posterior side; 11 - possible deepest invasion on the posterior side; 12 - right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 13 - right ovary; 14 - left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 15 - left ovary.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 60 x 40 x 7mm.  A possible lymph node is identified measuring 5 x 5 x 3mm.  
Blocks: 1 &2 - fatty tissue; 3 - possible lymph node.  AE.  
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm.  No definite lymph node is identified.  Entire specimen AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator and lymph node" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 5 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.  
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consistsof multiple fragments of fibrofatty tissue measuring 55 x 35 x 10mm in aggregate.  Four lesions are identified ranging from 7 to 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node; 3 - TS of one lymph node; 4 - ?one ?two lymph node.  
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Right round ligament" consists of a piece of fibrous tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm.  TS trisected and AE 1 block.  
 
I.  Specimen labelled "Left round ligament" consists of piece of fibrous tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 10mm.  Serially TS.  Cut sections are unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - two TS; 2 - two TS AE.  
J.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymphnode" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 25 x 5 x 5mm.  One lymph node is identified measuring 5 x 3 x 3mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 - rest of specimen AE.  
K.  Specimen labelled "Vaginal polyp" and consists of tan brown polypoid tissue measuring 7 x 5 x 5mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  AE 1 block.   
(TO: KD/ta 22/10/64)  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Kolen): 
A.  Onelymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
B.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 6mm through a wall 11mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present. The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  No lymph nodes are seen.
F.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H & I.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
J.  One lymph node shows no evidence ofmalignancy.
K.  Sections show a benign fibroepithelial polyp.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 6mm through a wall 11mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.  Ten (10) negative lymph nodes.
