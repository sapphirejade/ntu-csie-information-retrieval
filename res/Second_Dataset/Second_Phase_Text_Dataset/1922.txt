CLINICAL:
Abdominal wall desmoid.  No colonic disease.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Abdominal wall desmoid stitch at 12 o'clock" and consists of a piece of muscle with a suture for orientation marking 12 o'clock.  The superficial margin of the muscle is covered by fatty tissue, the deep margin is completely covered by facia/peritoneum.  Specimen measures 125mm from 12 to 6 o'clock and 110mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and up to 50mm from (superficial to deep) margin.  Specimen is inked blue at the superficial margin, black at the 9 o'clock margin and red at the 3 o'clock margin.  Serially sectioned from 12 to 6 o'clock into thirteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice thirteen 6 o'clock margin.  On sectioning and in slices one to thirteen there is a well circumscribed partially encapsulated solid tan and fibrous tumour measuring 65mm approximately from 12 to 6 o'clock, 65mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and up to 50mm from (superficial to deep) margin.  Macroscopically the tumour abuts the peritoneal surface in slices two to eleven.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram.  Specimen is sampled according to the attached diagram. 
Blocks: 1 to 4 - TS of 12 o'clock margin (slice one); 5 - RS slice two; 6 - RS slice three; 7 - RS slice four; 8 to 16 - slice eight; 17 & 18 - RS slice nine; 19 & 20 - LS 6 o'clock margin (slice thirteen).(GY/ta 24/12/64) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by DrX Marney):
Sections show a spindle cell lesion situated within skeletal muscle and deep fascia.  The lesion is present within all slices with size approximately 100mm, and consists of bland spindle cells arranged in haphazard long sweeping fascicles.  Moderate myxoid change is present and numerous mast cells are seen within the tumour.  No mitoses or areas of necrosis are seen.  The tumour has an infiltrative edge, infiltrating between skeletal muscle fibres.  The tumour cells show focal nuclear positivity with B-Catenin and a focal positivity with SMA.  The desmin stain is negative.  The morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with an abdominal wall fibromatosis (Desmoid).  The tumour breeches the fascia atthe deep aspect of the specimen and extends to the deep resection margin.  The superficial margin is 1.5mm clear, the 6 o'clock margin 4mm clear and the 12 o'clock margin 6mm clear.  The 3 and 9 o'clock margins are well clear.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Abdominal wall:  
-  Abdominal wall fibromatosis (Desmoid).
-  Positive deep margin.
