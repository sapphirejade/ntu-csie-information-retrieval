HISTORY:
Umbilicus. Omentum, right colon, peritoneal disease. Small bowel
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE". 
Right colon - Small bowel measures 70mm in length with maximum diameter of 40mm. Mesentery is present measuring 200x70x3mm. Numerous pale tumour deposits are noted on the mesentery and serosal surface of the small bowel. Right colon measures 300mmin length with maximum diameter of 30mm. Mesocolon is present measuring 300x30x20mm. Numerous tumour deposits are noted on the mesocolon and serosal surface of the colon. Mucosal surface of the small bowel and large bowel is unremarkable. Appendix is present measuring 30mm in length with maximum diameter of 5mm. Appendix is encased by pale tumour deposits. Numerous tumour deposits are noted within the mesocolon. 
(1 LS proximal margin; 2 LS distal margin with tumour; 3&4 RS section of small bowel with tumour; 5&6 RS section of colon with tumour; 7 LS tip of appendix; 8 TS mid appendix; 9 LS base of appendix; 10 RS of mesocolon with tumour).
Segment of colon measuring 80mm in length with maximum diameter of 40mm. Serosal surface is covered by numerous tumour deposits extending to the surgical margin. Mucosal surface is unremarkable. 

(11&12 LS of margins; 13 TS of colon with tumour deposit).
fragments of peritoneal disease measuring in aggregate 300x300x60mm. Numerous tumour deposits are noted. 
(14-16 RS sections of peritoneum; 17 reserved block for tumour banking). RS(M-17).
B. "SMALL BOWEL". A segment of small bowel measuring 60mm in length with maximum diameter of 30mm. Mesentery is present measuring 150x80x30mm. Serosal surface contains numerous tumour deposits. Mucosal surface is oedematous otherwise unremarkable. 
(1 LS of one margin; 2&3 LS of the other margins; 4 TS of colon with tumour deposit; 5 RS colon; 6 RS sections of mesentery with tumour deposits). RS (M-6/JWh/t).
C. "UMBILICUS". A piece of tissue measuring25x15x20mm. Ellipse of skin measuring 20x10mm is noted. Outer surface is inked blue. Specimen sectioned perpendicular to skin.  Cut surface is pale and fibrous without obvious tumour.
(1&2 RS TS ). RS (2-2).
MICROSCOPIC: (Y. Hollard)
A.  Sections of small intestine show extensive involvement of the serosa by an epithelioid tumour which shows predominantly papillary and micropapillary formations and focal tubular structures, together with a desmoplastic stromal response in some areas.  The epithelioid cells are large, with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, moderate variation in nuclear size and shape, prominent nucleoli and coarse chromatin.  Immunohistochemical stains for Calretinin, HBME-1, WT-1, Cytokeratin 5/6, Cytokeratin 7 and EMA are positive in the tumour cells.  Stains for HERA, CEA, TTF-1, and CDX2 are negative, while BER-EP4 shows a little focal positivity only. The mucin stain is negative. The overall features are consistent with epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.
  
There is extensive involvement of lymphatics by mesothelioma within the small intestine, including within lymphatics 3mm from the proximal margin of small intestine.Invasive mesothelioma is seen 2mm from the distal margin of the small intestine.  Multiple deposits of mesothelioma are also seen within the serosa, serosal lymphatics and on the serosal surface of the small intestine, colon, appendix and mesocolon.  There is extensive invasion within the serosa, including in serosal fat, and focally invasion is seen into the muscularis propria of the small intestine.  Multiple deposits of tumour are also seen within the peritoneum and within peritoneal lymphatics.  Two mesocolic lymph nodes and one colonic lymph node show no involvement.  
Sections of the colon also show serosal deposits at one margin, with an intralymphatic deposit seen 1mm from the opposite margin, within the serosa.  
B.  Sections of the small intestine show multiple deposits of malignant mesothelioma within the serosa and mesentery.  One margin appears clear, but the other shows involvement throughout the thickened serosa, 1mm from this margin, and also within lymphatics at this margin.  
C.  Sections of the umbilicus show skin and subcutis with extensive fibrosis and a focal foreign body type reaction.  No involvement by tumour is identified in the representative tissue examined.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE :
-EPITHELIOID MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA WHICH SHOWS EXTENSIVEINVOLVEMENT OF THE SMALL INTESTINE, RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM.  FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE TEXT.
B.  SMALL BOWEL :
-EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY EPITHELIOID MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA.
C.  UMBILICUS :
-NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.
