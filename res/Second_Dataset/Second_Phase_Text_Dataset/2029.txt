CLINICAL:
Distal pancreas and splenectomy.  Obese, asthma.  ?reported as mucinous cystic pancreatic tumour on CT.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Distal pancreas and spleen", consists of a distal pancreatectomy measuring 100 x 80 x 60mm which is attached to a spleen measuring 140 x 90 x 50mm and a piece of omentum measuring 370 x 200 x 20mm.  The proximal stapled pancreatic margin is removed and the underlying tissue is inked green.  There is a large cystic mass identified taking up the majority of the distal pancreas measuring 95 x 80 x 60mm.  The cut surface reveals a multilocular cystic mass containing mucinous and serous type material.  The anterior surface is inked blue the posterior surface is inked black and the superior aspect is inked red.  The tumour comes towithin 30mm of the proximal resection margin and appears to abut the anterior, posterior, superior and inferior margins.  More normal appearing pancreatic tissue is identified distally.  No suspicious areas are identified in the fat.  
Blocks: 1 and 2- representative spleen; 3 to 8 - representative tumour and anterior surface; 9 to 13 - tumour to posterior surface; 12 and 13 - superior margin; 14 and 15 - inferior margin; 16 - tumour to normal appearing pancreas; 17 to 19 - proximal resection margin; 20 - perisplenic lymph node; 21 to 23 - representative omentum
(GN/vo 24.2.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Biener & registrar Dr G Lazaroff):
Sections of the distal pancreas show a multilocular cystic tumour lined in the majority of areas by tall columnar, mucin producing epithelium whilst in other areas the epithelium is more attenuated and cuboidal.  Focal intestinal metaplasia is present. There is minimal cytological and architectural atypia.  Ovarian-like stroma surrounds many of the cysts.  The features are consistent with a mucinouscystic neoplasm with low grade dysplasia (mucinous cystadenoma).   The tumour appears completely excised.  The surrounding pancreatic tissue shows significant atrophy.  A benign splenunculus is identified in the perisplenic fat.  The spleen and omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Distal pancreas and spleen:
- Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, low grade dysplasia (mucinous cystadenoma)
- Excision appears complete.
