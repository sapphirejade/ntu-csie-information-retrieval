SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (1.10.62):


CLINICAL:
Ascending colon cancer.  Right hemicolectomy. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by GE
Specimen labelled "Right colon", consists of a right hemicolectomy comprising a segment of terminal ileum measuring 70mm in length with an open circumference of 30mm at the proximal resection margin, in continuity with caecum and ascending colon measuring 170m in length with an external diameter of up to 60mm at the distal resection margin. Arising immediately inferior to the ileocaecal valve on the caecal mucosa there is a fungating tumour measuring 30 x 25mm. The tumour is 80mm from the proximal resection margin and 120mm from the distalresection margin. The cut surface of the tumour shows full thickness bowel wall involvement but there is no macroscopic evidence of invasion into the pericaecal fat.  The remainder of the bowel mucosa appears macroscopically normal. The appendix is not identified.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 2-20mm across.  
Representative sections in 14 blocks.  
Block 1 - proximal margin; 2 - distal margin; 3 & 4 - tumour to serosa; 5 & 6 - tumour to pericaecal fat; 7 - tumour research block; 8 - apical lymph node; 9 - next apical lymph node; 10 - one lymph node bisected; 11-14 - four lymph nodes in each.  (FR/ec  29.10.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr M Wolff)  
Sections show a moderately differentiated mucinous (colloid) carcinoma of caecum, arising in a villous adenoma. A synopticreport follows:

DIAGNOSIS:
Right hemicolectomy:  Mucinousadenocarcinoma of caecum.  pT3 pN0 pMx R0. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT(1.10.62):
Immunostains for mismatch repair enzymes have now been performed.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:  Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:  Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:  Preserved nuclear staining.
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
