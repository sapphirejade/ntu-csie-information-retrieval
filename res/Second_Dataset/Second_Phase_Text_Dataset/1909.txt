CLINICAL:
Excision of chest wall mass ?chondroma ?chondrosarcoma.  Long stitch lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right subcostal mass, short stitch superior, long lateral" and consists of an excision of soft tissue with orienting sutures, measuring 95mm (medial to lateral) x 58mm (superior to inferior) x 45mm (superficial to deep).  There is overlying ellipse of skin, 99 x 33mm.  The deep margin includes smooth mobile peritoneum, 55 x 32mm.  Over the superior soft tissue there is included partial rib, 45 x 10mm.  The superior margin is inked blue and inferior margin black.  Centred within the skeletal muscle is a circumscribed nodule, 55mm (medial to lateral) x 35mm (superficial to deep) x 32mm (superior to inferior).  The cut surface has a glistening chondroid appearance.  The tumour appears to abut the included rib.  The tumour abuts the peritoneum and the deep portion of the superior margin, howeverthe tumour appears to have been excised intact.  The tumour contains small haemorrhagic areas.  There are calcified areas within the tumour, in the region adjacent to the rib.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - superior soft tissue margin with skin from medial to lateral; 4 to 7 - inferior soft tissue margin with skin from lateral to medial; 8 - medial margin; 9 - lateral margin; 10 - deep superior soft tissue margin with peritoneum; 11 - deep inferior/lateral soft tissue margin with peritoneum; 12 - deep/medial inferior soft tissue margin with peritoneum; 13 - tumour with inferior margin; 14 - tumour with overlying skin; 15 & 16 - tumour with inferior margin; 17 - tumour with peritoneum; 18 - tumour with skin; 19 & 20 - tumourwith superior and inferior margins with rib in block 20; 21 - tumour with rib; 22 - tumour for reserve block; 23 to 25 - calcified area of tumour with rib.  Please refer to attached diagram (PE/ta 30/1/64)  
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr M Crippen & registrar Dr M Basurto):
Sections show a well-circumscribed chondroid tumour which arises immediately adjacent to the costal cartilage, displacing adjacent skeletal muscle.The lesion has a pushing margin, multinodular architecture and low cellularity with small clusters of chondrocytes set in hyaline cartilage matrix.  The cells have small hyperchromatic nuclei without significant atypia.  Mitoses are not readily identifiable.  The features favour a chondroma, with the location of the tumour suggestive of a periosteal chondroma.
The tumour is surrounded by soft tissue with the closest margin 0.5mm clear at the deep margin.  The lesion is 1mm clear of the superior margin, 2mm clear of the inferior margin and well clear of all other margins.  
Comment:  As the case has been previously reviewed at the bone and soft tissue meeting at ROCKINGHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL Hospital, the excision specimen will be resubmitted for follow up review.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right subcostal mass:  Favour periosteal chondroma (see comment)
