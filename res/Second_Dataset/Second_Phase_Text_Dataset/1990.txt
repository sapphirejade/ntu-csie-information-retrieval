CLINICAL:
Hookwire excision of left breast at 2 o'clock.Marking stitch: long lateral, short superior, medium medial.  Breast lesion and sentinel node.  For X-ray to confirm complete hookwire embedded in tissue.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel lymph node", consists of one lymph node with surrounding fat measuring 20mm x 10mm x 8mm.  It has been slicedinto five slices.  AE 2 blocks. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Lesion left breast, sutures long lateral, medium medial, short superior", consists of irregularly shaped fibrofatty tissue orientated with sutures measuring 65mm (medial to lateral) x 45mm (superficial to deep) x 23mm (superior to inferior) and weighs 46.7g.  There are three sutures in place.  There is a hookwire entering from the lateral surface.  The superior surface is inked red, anterior/superficialblue, deep green and inferior surface black.  The specimen is sliced into ten slices from medial to lateral.  The cut surface shows a firm ill-defined pale lesion in slices 3 to 5, measuring 20mm x 18mm x 15mm.  The lesion lies 5mm from deep margin and inferior margin, 4mm from superior margin and 20mm away from the anterior margin.  There is an area of haemorrhage in slice six and seven (probable hookwire trauma). The hookwire tip is in slice three.  The rest of the tissue is uniformly fibrofatty.  Specimen x-ray received.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - slice one; 4 and 5 - slice two; 6 to 8 - slice three; 9 to 11 - slice four (block 9 reserved for tumour banking); 12 - RS of slice five; 13 to 15 - slice six; 16 to 17 - slice eight; 18 to 19 - slice ten.
