HISTORY:  
? Endometrial Ca.  Biopsies of cervix, frozen section.  GI endometrial adeno Ca
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  'CERVICAL BIOPSY'.  A piece of pale tissue 4x4x2mm.  AE (1-1)
Frozen section report:  'Negative, inflammation'.  CURTIS PASKOW to Dr Denne, 4.35pm. 
B.  'UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, TUBES'.  A uterus with cervix and bilateral tubes andovaies.  Total specimen weight 110g. The uterus measures 75x50x40mm.
Ectocervix measures 45x30mm.  The cervical mucosa is unremarkable.  Anterior cervix blue, posterior black.  
The right fallopian tube measures 60mm inlength with maximum diameter of 3mm. There is a ligation clip proximally. No tube lesions are seen. Right ovary measures 20x15x12mm and shows no focal lesions.  
The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with maximum diameter of 5 mm. There is a ligation clip proximally. No tube lesions are seen. Left ovary measures 15x10x8mm and shows no focal lesions.  
Involving mainly anterior body and fundus there is a partly polypoid friable pale soft endometrial tumour which is 15 mm in thickness. The tumour invades myometrium with a depth of about 6 mm (of myometrium thockness 17 mm). There is also some pale tumour posterior body, in a thin layer, and at the right cornu tumour invadesto within 5 mm of the posterior serosal surface. 
There are firm rounded nodules up to 5 mm across, deep to the inferior posterior peritoneal reflection. No other serosal lesions are seen. 
Blocks:  1-3 full LSanterior uterus; 3-7 full LS posterior uterus; 8 right cornu; 9 left cornu; 10 right parametrium; 11 left parametrium; 12 R tube LS fimbrial end; 13 right ovary and TS tube, LS fimbria; 14 L tube LS fimbrial end and TS mid tube 15 left ovary;  RS (M-15); HS; Further sections (LV)  -17 R post cornu: invasion 5 mm to serosa; 18,19 posterior LUS with tumour, upper endocervix, and post serosal reflection/POD; 20,21,22 tumour uterine body anterior: invasion 9 mm of 17 mm; partly polypoid; 7 mm clear to serosa; LV
C.  'RIGHT LYMPH NODES'.  A piece of fatty tissue 35x30x20mm, with four lymph nodes measuring 20x15x3mm, 15x6x3mm, 8 and 6mm identified.  (1,2 one node; 3 three nodes; 4 remainder of fatty tissue). All embedded. (M-4)
D.  'LEFT LYMPH NODES'.  Multiple fragments of fatty tissue, in aggregate 40x40x10mm.  Five lymph nodes are identified.  The largest measures 20x15x8mm. (1 one node; 2 one node; 3 three nodes; 4 remainder of fat; All embedded. (M-4)
E.  'LEFT PARAMETRIUM'.  Fibrofatty tissue 3x1x1mm.  All embedded.  (1-1)
F.  'OMENTAL BIOPSY'.  A piece of omentum measuring 25x10x6mm.  The serosal surface and the cut surfaceare unremarkable.  All embedded. (M-1/DD/nh).
- MICROSCOPIC -
A.  Cervical biopsy:
Sections show endocervical glandular tissue with benign tunnel clusters.
B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, tubes:
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA:
Histologic tumour type:  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Grade:  FIGO grade 1
Myometrial invasion: Present. 
Depth of invasion: 9 mm through myometrial thickness of 20 mm (slide B21)
(Approximately 45 % of myometrium invaded)
Lymphovascular invasion: Present, several foci, at tumour interface.
Involvement of cervix: Not involved
Cervical vascular involvement: Absent
Uterine peritoneal surface involvement:Absent
Excision margins:  Paracervical and parametrial margins are negative for tumour.
Other: 
Right and left fallopian tubes: Tumour free, unremarkable
Right and left ovaries:  Tumour free, unremarkable
Residual nontumour endometrium:  Hyperplastic
In situ carcinoma (serous intraepithelial carcinoma):  Absent
Ectocervix: largely, denuded, atrophic, otherwise unremarkable
Endocervix:  Unremarkable
Posterior serosa: Endosalpingiosis and focal endometriosis, with nodular smooth muscle hyperplasia.
C.  Right lymph nodes:
Lymph nodes are involved by tumour
Nodes involved: 1
Total number: 8
Maximum dimension of metastasis/range: small clusters, largest 0.2 mm, in marginal sinuses around focally within the involved node. Cells are ER+, Pax8+, calretinin-.
Extranodal spread: absent
D.  Left lymph nodes:
Lymph node are involved bytumour
Nodes involved: 2
Total number: 6
Maximum dimension of metastasis/range: small clusters, largest 0.2 mm, in sinuses and within node
Extranodal spread: Absent
E.  Left parametrium:
Sections show a piece of distorted fibromuscular tissue with no lesion seen.
F.  Omental biopsy: 
Tumour free. The omentum shows focal surface mesothelial hyperplasia.
Other tests:
Peritoneal washings:  Negative(see separate cytology report 23H16364)
Ancillary studies/representative blocks:

Immunostains for DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) proteins, (block: B7):
MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6:  Nuclear staining is present (intact expression). 
MSH2 is only focally positive but MSH6 shows moderate positive staining, still variable. This variability may be related to fixation variation.  MLH1 and PMS2 show diffuse strong staining.
Comment:
Immunohistochemistry of cancer tissues for mismatch repair proteins is a surrogate marker for MSI status, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result. Intact expression of all four proteins in the above Immunostains indicates that MMR enzymes tested are intact.
