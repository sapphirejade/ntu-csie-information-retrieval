MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr F Murzynski & Dr F Rhodes) 
A & C (Right sentinel lymph node and right breast)
Four sentinel lymph nodes show reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy (0/4).  The CAM5.2 keratin immunostains are negative.
The carcinoma in the right breast is an 11.5mm grade 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST, with associated intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), cancerisation of lobules and columnar cell hyperplasia with cytological atypia. The profile of the tumour resembles a radial scar.  The carcinoma is arranged in well formed tubules and focal cribriform structures.  Although the carcinoma displays prominent tubular morphology including apical snouts, the nuclear grade is inconsistent with tubular carcinoma.  The carcinoma has the following features:

The carcinoma in the left breast is a 14mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST The carcinoma consists of solid nests and trabeculae with minimal tubule formation.  There is minor growth in single file arrays, however, E cadherin expression is preserved consistent with ductal carcinoma.  There is intermediate grade DCIS within the confines of the invasive tumour and as a non-contiguous focus in the upper inner quadrant, the latter colonisinga 5mm intraduct papilloma and showing patchy clear cell morphology and loss of CK5/6 immunoexpression.  There is also an adjacent separate 2mm focus of low grade DCIS.  The carcinoma has the following features:
