HISTORY:  
Uterine carcinosarcoma.  Right ovary and tube.  Uterus + cervix + left fallopian tube + ovary.  Right para-aortic lymph node.  Right iliac lymph node.  Left iliac lymph node.  Omental biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE".  A fallopian tube with attached ovary between which there is a large cyst.  The fallopian tube is 80x6mm.  The ovary is 25x15x10mm.  The cyst is 85x80x60mm and has a smooth shiny external surface, a wall less than 1mm in thickness and a lumen filled with straw-coloured fluid.  There are no solid or papillary areas seen.  
(1 fimbria and fallopian tube;2&3 TS fallopian tube and ovary; 4-8 sections of cyst wall).  RS (M-8).
B.  "UTERUS, LEFT TUBE AND OVARY AND CERVIX".  Uterus with attached left fallopian tube and ovary.  The specimen has been received partially opened coronally through the cervix and uterine body with significant distortion and disorientation.  The fallopian tube is 45x5mm and the ovary is 20x10x10mm.  Both are unremarkable.  The uterus and attached fallopian tube and ovary weighs 570g.  It is approximately 140mm from fundus to ectocervix.  The uterine body is approximately 100x100mm.  The uterine cervix is approximately 40mm from isthmus to ectocervix and 25x20mm.  Also in the jar are multiple pieces of tan and haemorrhagic soft tissue with an aggregate of 70x50x25mm.  The endometrium is difficult to assess but is approximately 2-3mm in thickness.  There are three fibroid present, the first is15mm and located on the subserosal surface and has a white whorled cut surface and is well demarcated.  The second is in the fundus and is 65mm in maximum dimension and has a white whorled cut surface and a well demarcated border.  Thethird is located towards the cervical isthmus and is 40mm in diameter and has a yellow cystic and haemorrhagic cut surface, being quite soft to touch.  It does have a whorled appearance but the margins are less well defined than usual.There is a fourth fibroid located within the posterior myometrial wall which is 12mm in diameter and has a necrotic central area.  
A large amount of necrotic material falls out of the endometrial cavity on sagittal sectioning.  However, moderate amounts of tumour remain attached to the posterior wall and to the fibroid.  The largest fibroid located in the fundus.  The tumour is not obviously invading into the myometrial wall.  
(1 fallopian tube; 2 ovary; 3 right parametrium; 4 left parametrium; 5-10 sections of polypoid tumour that has fallen out of endometrial cavity; 11 anterior cervix; 12 posterior cervix; 13-15 small necrotic ?fibroid in posterior myometrium; 16 relationship of second biggest and biggest fibroid with one another; 17-22 sections of ?atypical leiomyoma located towards uterine isthmus; 23 smaller fibroid on anterior subserosal surface; 24-27 relationship of tumour to myometrium on posterior myometrial wall; 28-30 relationship of tumour to fundic fibroid; 31-35 fundic fibroid; 36 reserve tissue for tumour bank).  RS (M-36).
C.  "RIGHT PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE".  Necrotic tan tissue with an aggregate of 20x20x5mm.  AE(M-3).
D.  "RIGHT ILIAC LYMPH NODE".  Multiple pieces of fatty tissue with an aggregate of 30x20x5mm within which there are seven nodes.
(1 three nodes; 2 two nodes; 3 two nodes).  RS (7-3).
E.  "LEFTILIAC LYMPH NODE".  A strip of fatty tissue 40x10x5mm within which there are four nodes.  AE (4-1).
F.  "OMENTUM BIOPSY".  A piece of omentum which is 80x30x5mm.  There are no nodular or solid areas.  RS (4-4/IZ/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. D. Cuccaro)
A.  Representative sections of the ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the macroscopically described 85mm cystshow an attenuated epithelial lining mostly likely an attenuated serous epithelial lining in keeping with a serous cyst.  There is no evidence of proliferation or of malignancy.  
B.  Sections show a uterine carcinosarcoma.There is extensive exophytic component, much of it detached from the endometrial surface.  There is a small identifiable surface component and a necrotic deposit within the myometrium (macroscopically interpreted as leiomyoma in the posterior uterine wall).  Much of the tumour is sarcomatoid with no heterologous elements.  Only small areas of carcinoma are identifiable.  The carcinoma is characterised by sheets of high grade undifferentiated tumour with areas of necrosis.  There is associated lymphovascular space invasion.  
Three leiomyomas are identified.  There is no evidence of atypia or mitotic activity.  Sections of the ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable. 
C.  The specimen is significantly fragmented and includes lymph node remnant, together with abundant largely necrotic metastatic tumour.  The appearances are interpreted as involvement of a lymph node by metastatic carcinosarcoma.  
D.  Sections show seven benign reactive lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy. 
E.  Sections show three benign reactive lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy.
F.  Represenative sections of the omentum show patchy surface mesothelial hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
