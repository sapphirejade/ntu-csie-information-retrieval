CLINICAL:
Subcutaneous spindle cell tumour - L medial upper thigh.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Mass (tumour) left thigh stitch 12 o'clock", consists of an unorientated wide local excision of subcutaneous tissue measuring70mm (3-9 o'clock) x 110mm (6-12 o'clock) x 60mm (superficial to deep). There is a suture attached to one pole marking 12 o'clock. The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 
9 o'clock margin is inked green while the deep margin is inked black. There is an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 90 x18mm which appears unremarkable.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the transverse plane into seven slices from slice 1
 - 12 o'clock to slice7 - 6 o'clock.  There is a firm cream well circumscribed lesion identified in slices 2-6 measuring 39mm (3-9 o'clock) x 58mm (12-6 o'clock) x 30mm (superficial to deep).  The lesion appears well circumscribed and is able to be shelled out and macroscopically clear of margins. The distance from the margins is as follows:  deep 3mm, 3 o'clock - 8mm, 9 o'clock - 10mm, and well clear of both the 
and 6 o'clock margins. Focally the tumour appears haemorrhagic.  
Block 1 - slice 1; 2-5 - slice 4; 6 & 7 - slice 5; 8 - slice 7; 9 & 10 - representative tumour.  (JG/ec  5.1.64)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr A Rickenbaker)
Sections show a well circumscribed cellular spindle cell neoplasm within the subcutaneous tissue.  The overlyingskin is unremarkable.  The lesion contains intersecting, sharply marginated groups of well differentiated smooth muscle cells.  The tumourcells are elongated and blunt-ended.  There is only mild cytological atypia.  There are frequent mitoses (up to 26 per 50 HPF).  Hyalinised areas are focally present but no necrosis is seen.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for SMA, Desmin and Vimentin.  The stains for S100 and MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin)are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is more than 5%.  The appearances are consistent with those of well differentiated leiomyosarcoma.  The tumour is completely excised.  The tumour is 2mm to the deep margin (block3), 8mm to the 3 o'clock margin and 10mm to the 9 o'clock margin.  The other margins are well clear.
FNCLCC grading
Tumour differentiation:	Score 1 (well differentiated)
Mitotic count:			Score 1 (0-9 mitoses per 10 HPF)
Tumour necrosis:		Score 0 (no necrosis)
Histological grade:		Grade 1 (Total score 2)
The tissue block best for molecular/genetic testing is:  block 2
DIAGNOSIS:
Left thigh - Well differentiated leiomyosarcoma.
