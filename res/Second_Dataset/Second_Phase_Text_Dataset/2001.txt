CLINICAL:
Left ovarian cyst.  Stage 2c serous borderline ovarian tumour.  Completion surgery.  Left ovariancyst on U/S.  Hx serous borderline tumour on right.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Lefttube and ovary", consists of an ovary measuring 45 x 30 x 25mm with tubes measuring 85mm in length and 15mm in diameter.  There is a blood filled cyst in the ovary with a small 8mm cyst on the surface. 
Frozen section 1 blood filled cyst, 2 serosal cyst. 
Blocks: 1 and 2 - frozen section; 3 to 5 - further sections of the ovary with cyst area; 6 - TS of the tube
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign cysts; including simple serous cyst and follicular cyst.
Phone results to Dr Anaesthetic registrar by Dr U Picht at 10:30am on 3.12.14
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 242g in total.  The uterus measures 125 x 80 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 45 x 45mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 2mmin maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains multiple fibroids ranging from 5mm to 25mm in maximum diameter.  At the lower segment of the uterus there is a white patch 7 x 5mm on the endometrium surface.  There is a thin walled cyst at the posterior serosal surface 17mm in diameter.  The cyst contains clear fluid and smooth internal and external surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full longitudinal sections of anterior body and cervix; 6 to 10 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 11 and 12 - further sections of the plaque on the endometrial surface (the plaque AE); 13 - sections of the cyst over the serosal surface; 14 - another section of one of the fibroids. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a portion of omentum 250 x 80 x 5mm.  No tumour deposits or lymph nodes identified.  Representative sections in blocks 1 to 3.(TO: SM;NS/vo 2.6.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. U Jaffray):
A.  Sectionsshow follicular cysts, a simple serous cyst and a tiny serous cystadenofibroma. The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  Theendometrium is proliferative.  The myometrium shows small leiomyomas.  The uterine serosa shows some benign mesothelial cysts.  No implants are seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections of the omentum show a tiny focus of endosalpingiosis.  No implants are seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A, B & C.  No evidence of malignancy.
