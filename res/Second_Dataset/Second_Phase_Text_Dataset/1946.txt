MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Dupar): 
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary.  The tubeshows a hydrosalpinx.  ER and PR are pending.
B.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The frozen section shows a tiny focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma but this cuts out in the paraffin section.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show numerous deposits of metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the left ovary with metastases in the right pelvic side wall and the omentum.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 11/6/64:
