SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.9.64):


CLINICAL:
Recurrent left parietal intra-axial tumour.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left parietal tumour" consists of a tiny fragment of haemorrhagic tissue 3mm.  Divided half for smear and half for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No definite tumour.
Phone result to Dr T Silman by Dr T Bulls at 2.15pm on 25.06.14. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left parietal lesion" consists of multiple pieces of soft friable tissue measuring in aggregate 5 x 5 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: TW  JU/mm 28.8.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr T Simonian): 
A.  Sections show a piece of cortex and white matter.  No tumour is seen.
B.  Sections show pieces of cortex and white matter.  Most of the tissue is cellular tumour.  The tumour cells have enlarged, atypical pleomorphic nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are identified and there is also microvascular proliferation.  The features are of recurrent glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  There are also foci of infarct-like necrosis with hyalinised vessels, consistent with radiotherapy effect but most of the tumour appears viable.   

Immunohistochemical stains: 
GFAP:   Positive. 
IDH1:   To be repeated. 
Ki 67:   Proliferation index around 25%.
CD68:   Highlights numerous macrophages and activated microglial cells.
Molecular tests:
Tissue has been sent to the COOLAH MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Institute for assessment of MGMT methylation status.  A supplementary report will be issued.
Block for potential treatment trial (if required):
Viable tumour is best seen in block B1.


DIAGNOSIS: 
A.  Left parietal tissue:  No tumour.
B.  Left parietal tumour:  Recurrent glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.9.64):
B.  MGMT testing was performed at the CALVARY PUBLIC HOSPITAL ACT Research Centre.
DNA was extracted, bisulphite modified and subjected to pyrosequencing to amplify a region of the MGMT promoter in order to detect methylation.
The sample was tested twice with the appropriate controls and was found to be lowly methylated (14%) at the MGMT promoter region.
Reported by Dr T Alberson.
Please note that this test was performed in a research laboratory which is not NATA accredited.
