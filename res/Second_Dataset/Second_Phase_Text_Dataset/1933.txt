HISTORY:  
Colorectal cancer with peritoneal disease.  Transverse colon, rectum, uterus, bilateral ovaries, omentum, abdominal wall mass.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
"UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, WALL MASS [illegible]".  There are multiple specimens.
A piece of bowel 180mm in length and 50mm in diameter.  There is omentum attached to this piece of bowel which is irregular in shape, being approximately 300x200x20mm.  Within this fatty tissue, there are two large white hard nodules 50 and 35mm in diameter respectively.  The second of these nodules which is 30mm from the first nodule is directly attached to a piece of muscle which is 60x60x25mm.  
(1 section of bowel; 2&3 single section through nodule attached to bowel wall and showing relationship of ?peritoneal wall in block 3; 4&5 single section divided of second nodule and relationship to ?muscle; 6 third nodule within omentum) 
The second large specimen consists of uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries with attached fatty tissue and bowel.  The bowel is 160mm in length and 40mm in diameter and has an anastomosis site around which there is solid white tumour located in fatty tissue 25 mm in diameter.  On the serosal surface, there is a well demarcated solid fatty nodule30mm in diameter which has a homogeneous yellow cut surface.  The distal part of the bowel appears to be at the anterior peritoneal reflection.  The bowel is attached by a thin strip of fatty tissue to the right adnexa.  This strip of fatty tissue is 40x10mm and does not appear to contain any tumour deposits.  The uterus alone weighs 80g and is 90mm from fundus to ectocervix.  The uterine body is 60x40mm.  The uterine cervix is 30x15mm.  The endometrium is 1mm thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in thickness.  There is coarse trabeculation in the fundus, but no other focal lesions are seen.  The right fallopian tube is 40x8mm and the right ovary is 25x20x20mm.  The cut surface of the ovary reveals a solid white nodule 15mm in diameter.  The left fallopian tube is 70x8mm and the left ovary is 20x10x5mm.  
(7 ?fatty tissue attached to serosal surface of bowel; 8 section of bowel at distal end; 9 cervix anterior and posterior; 10&11 endometrium from body; 12 fundus; 13 right fallopian tube; 14&15 right ovary; 16 left fallopian tube; 17 left ovary).  RS (M-17/KD/nh). Further tissue 18 Left ovary; 19-21 sections from anastomosis 4-4 RS SV
MICROSCOPIC:  (K. Cuthill)
Sections of the large bowel show pigmented laden macrophages in the lamina propria consistent with pseudomelanosis coli.  The nodule attached to the large bowel and the large lesion within the omental fat show features of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensivenecrosis consistent with colorectal origin.  The tumours involves subserosal fat extending through to the submucosa.  There is involvement of the free peritoneal surface.  There is tumour within lymphatic and vascular spaces.  The mucosal surface shows no evidence of tumour involvement.  
There is tumour involvement of the anastomosis.  Metastatic carcinoma is seen inone lymph node identified.
Sections of the cervix show Nabothian cysts.  The myometrium shows multiple foci of adenomyosis.  The endometrial glands show secretory activity suggestive of progesterone effect.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in the rightovary.  The left ovary shows occasional epithelial inclusion cysts.  Both fallopian tubes show no evidence of tumour.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, WALL MASS -
-RECURRENT AND METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING COLON AND RIGHT OVARY.
