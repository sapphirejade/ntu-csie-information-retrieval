CLINICAL:
Left mastectomy.  Prior left breast invasive ductal carcinoma (clear margins) with widespread DCIS.  Marking stitch @ lateral skin edge.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left mastectomy, left breast with stitch lateral" consists of a mastectomy specimen measuring 170mm (medial to lateral) x 150 (superior to inferior) x 70mm (anterior to posterior).  Overlying skin measures 170 x 140mm with a scar lateral of nipple measuring 80mm.  The nipple has 10mm diameter.  The skin and nipple are unremarkable with exception of a scar. There is one suture in place. The anterior surface is inked blue and posterior surfaceis inked black. Cut surface shows cavity with capsule in the lower outer quadrant corresponding to the scar measuring 60mm x 40mm x 25mm.  It lies 1mm away from the posterior margin, 25mm from the anterior surface and 30mm from the nipple.  The rest of the tissue is uniformly fibrofatty.
Blocks:  1 - nipple; 2 - sub areolar; 3 to 36 - all of cavity with capsule; 37 - upper inner quadrant; 38 - lower inner quadrant; 39 - upper outer quadrant; 40 - lower inner quadrant.  (EG/rt 14.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Shindledecker):
Sections of breast show a cavity surrounded by fibroscar tissue, in keeping with previous surgery.  The surrounding area shows fibrosis and foreign body reaction.  The tissue away from the cavity is unremarkable.  No residual tumour is seen.The nipple is unremarkable.  The deep margin is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of in-situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast mastectomy - Fibroscar tissue.
