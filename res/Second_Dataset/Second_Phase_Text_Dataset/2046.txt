CLINICAL:
Right breast 10 o'cl IDC - wide local excision + sentinel node biopsy. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled "Right sentinel lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm. Two lymph nodes identified measuring from 10 to 18mm.
Blocks: 1- one lymph node sliced into 3 slices; 2 & 3 - one lymph node sliced into 6 slices; 4 - remaining tissue.
B. Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion, long lateral, short superior, medium medial" consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue with an ellipse of skin measuring 100mm (medial to lateral) x 50mm (superficial to deep) x 60mm (superior to inferior) and weighing 124.7g. The ellipse of skin measures 35 x 14mm. There are three sutures inplace. The superior surface is inked red, anterior/superficial surface is inked blue, inferior surface is inked black and deep surface is inked green. Specimen has been sliced into 14 sliced from medial to lateral. The cut surface shows a pale firm ill defined lesion in slice 2 to slice 5 measuring 32 x 20 x 15mm. The tumour lies 3mm from deep margin, 10mm from inferior margin, 22mm from superior margin, 40mm from anterior/superficial margin. The rest of the tissue isuniformly fibrofatty.
Blocks: 1 to5-slice 1; 6 & 7 - RS of slice 2; 8 to 15 - slice 4; 16 to 19-RS of slice 5; 20 to 25 - slice 6; 26 - RS of slice 8; 27 & 28 - slice 10; 29 - slice 12; 30- slice 14; 31 - tumour banking. (TO: XG: UO/mm 20.5.65)
The rest of the tissue embedded as follows:
32-34 - rest of slice 2, 35-41 slice 3,42-48 the rest of slice 5,49-55 slice 7,56-58 the rest of slice 8,59-61 slice 9,62 -slice 11 and 63 --slice 63 (FJ)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Shuster)
A.  Two (2) of three (3) three lymph nodes contain deposits of metastaticadenocarcinoma, one of which is over 2mm and the other measuring 1.5mm. No extranodal extension is seen. 
B.  Sections show a 22mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.  The tumour is relatively circumscribed and and arranged in small and large nests and sheets (tubulescore =3).  The tumour cells display monomorphic grade 2 nuclei with moderate eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm.   Mitoses number up to 6/10 hpf. There are numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion in the medial third of the specimen in the inferior half of the slices.  Immunostains demonstrate preserved E-cadherin expression and patchy CD56 expression, however,  other more specific neuroendocrine markers such as Chromogranin and Synaptophysin are negative and the tumour is classified as infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST. 
A separate 3mm infiltrating carcinoma (E cadherin pending) arranged in small nests and cords (tubules score =3) with nuclear grade 1 and mitoses 0/ 3hpf, is present about 8mm deep to the main tumour (block 41) arising within a fieldof low to intermediate grade DCIS which measure approximately 8mm (2 consecutive slices) The DCIS is present close to but outside the confines of the main invasive carcinoma. There is also low to intermediate grade DCIS in two consecutive slices (approximately 8mm) with cribriform architecture unassociated with necrosis or calcifications.  
The breast alsoshows a spectrum of atypical proliferative changes including flat epithelial atypia and several foci of columnar cell change with superimposed cytological atypia and architectural atypia equivalent to atypical ductal hyperplasia.  These foci measure up to 3mm in dimension.
