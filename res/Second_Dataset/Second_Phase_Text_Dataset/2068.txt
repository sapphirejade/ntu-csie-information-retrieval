CLINICAL:
Fibromatous lesion right shoulder involving subcutaneous tissue and fascia. ? nodular fasciitis.  Elliptical excision down onto and including fascia and underlying muscle.  Marking suture at 12 o'clock.  Further excision of anterior border (3 o'clock). Marking suture on margin.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Right shoulder mass stitch 12 o'clock", consists ofan orientated ellipse of skin measuring 125 x 35mm to a depth of 50mm. There is a suture attached to one pole marking 12 o'clock. The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock margin is inked black and the deep margin is inked red.  The deep margin appears somewhat irregular and fragmented.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the transverse plane into fourteen slices from slice 1 - 12 o'clock margin to slice 14 - 6 o'clock margin.  There is a cream firm relatively well circumscribed lesion identified in slices 5-9 measuring 25mm (3-9 o'clock) x 28mm (12-6 o'clock) x 20mm (superficial to deep). Thelesion appears to come to 2mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 17mm from the deep margin, 28mm from the 9 o'clock margin and well clear of both the 12 and 6 o'clock margins.  Block 1 & 2- slice 1; 3 - slice 5; 4-7 - slice 6; 8-11 - slice 7; 12 & 13 -slice 8; 14 & 15 - slice 14. Please refer to attached diagram. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Re excision of anterior margin", consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 70 x 35 x 12mm.  There is a suture attached to one side marking the margin.  The sutured side is inked blue and the opposite side is inked black. Serially sectioned, AE 8 blocks. (TO: RI/ec  12.3.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof P Artice):
A. Sections show a cellular proliferation of bland fibroblastic spindle cells arranged in broad fascicles, with interspersed thin walled vessels and occasional chronic inflammatory cells. The nuclei areoval and slightly enlarged with finely granular chromatin and small distinct nucleoli. 
Mitoses are infrequent (approximately 2 per 10 hpf) and no atypical forms are identified. No necrosis or heterologous elements are seen.
The spindle cells show positive nuclear staining with beta-Catenin and patchy staining with smooth muscle actin and desmin. Ki67 expression is low(1 - 2%). The tumour cells are negative for S100 
The lesion has a reasonably defined edge with stag-horn extensions into adjacent fibroadipose tissue. Focally the lesion extends to within 1mm of the blue inked 3 o'clock margin.
The lesion also extends close (within 1mm) of the deep margin but this margin was noted to be somewhat fragmented macroscopically and the relation of this close margin to overlying skeletal muscle is uncertain.
B. Sections show fibroadipose tissue. No evidence of tumour is seen and all of the tissue has been embedded.
Dr P Breitenbach has also seen representative sections of this case and agrees with the above.
This result was discussed with Prof P Carualho by A/Prof P Alrod.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT SHOULDER MASS: FIBROMATOSIS
B. RE-EXCISION ANTERIOR MARGIN: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
