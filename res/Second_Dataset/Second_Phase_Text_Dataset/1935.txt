HISTORY:  
Metastatic colon cancer. Peritonectomy performed. Omentum. Right hemicolectomy. Small bowel. Right ovary. Peritoneal disease.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "RIGHT OVARY, SMALL BOWEL, OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL TISSUE/DISEASE". 
Right colon: Consists of a segment of small bowel and colon. The smallbowel  measures 60mm in length with maximum diameter of 20mm. Mesentery is present measuring 20x100x20mm. Right colon measures 190mm in length with maximum diameter of 20mm. Mesocolon measures 300x80x30mm. Piece of omentum measuring 440x150x30mm, is adherent to the distal aspect of colon. There is anastomosis between the small bowel and the colon. Multiple tumour deposits are noted on the serosal surface of the small bowel. One of the deposits measures 12mm from the proximal margin. Mucosal surface of the small bowel is unremarkable. The serosal surface and the mucosal surface of the colon is unremarkable. On the cut surface of the omentum, multiple tumour deposits, largest measuring 50mm in maximal extent are noted. Possible three lymph nodes measuring 1-3mm in maximal extent identified.
(1 LS of proximal margin with a tumour deposit; 2 LS distal margin; 3&4 TS anastomosis; 5 TS terminal ileum with serosal tumour deposit;6 RS TS colon; 7 RS tumour deposit in omentum; 8 reserved block for tumour banking; 9 three possible lymph nodes).
A segment of small bowel measuring 70mm in length with maximum diameter of 17mm. Mesentery is present measuring 65x20x8mm. Serosal surface is dull, no obvious tumour deposits identified. Mucosal surface is unremarkable.
(10 LS margin; 11 RS TS of bowel).
Segment of small bowel measuring 25mm in length with maximum diameter of 15mm. Mesentery is present measuring 25x10x5mm. Serosal surface is dull, no obvious tumour deposits are identified. Mucosal surface is unremarkable. 
(12 RS LS with both margins).
A piece of tissue (presumed ovary) measuring 30x25x20mm. Outer surface is lobulated but smooth. The cut surface is pale and fibrous. 
(13&14 RS TS).
Multiple fragments of peritoneum/disease. Consists of multiple fragments of fibrous tissue measuring 70x45x25mm in aggregate. 
(15&16 RS TS). RS (M-16/QE/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (DR V Bohnenblust)    
The sections of the first described segment of bowel include small and large bowel with an anastomosis.  There are deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on the serosal surface of the small bowel and infiltrating into muscularis propria and submucosa.  One deposit ofcarcinoma is 7mm from the proximal resection margin.  The distal resection margin appears unremarkable.  There is a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the omentum. 
Three lymph nodes show reactive changes only.
Sections of the next described segment of bowel show small bowel with serosal adhesions.  
Sections of the next described segment of small bowel show serosal adhesions and suture granulomas and deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that is 5mm from the surgical margin.  
Sections of the ovary show deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma including lymphatic space invasion.  
Sections of the separate pieces of peritoneum/fibrofatty tissue demonstrate deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONECTOMY: -
- MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA - SEE TEXT FOR DETAILS.
