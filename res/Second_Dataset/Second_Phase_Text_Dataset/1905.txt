CLINICAL:
Left ovarian cyst.  Ca 125 = 159.  Serial section of tubes.  Menometrorrhagia.   Family history of breast cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an ovary 30 x 25 x 15mm, with an ovary 30 x 25 x 15mm, with overlying fallopian tube 50mm in length and 8mm diameter.  Also received is a separate haemorrhagic tissue fragment 25mm across.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - fallopian tube serially embedded from proximal to fimbria; 5 to 10 - ovary; 11 - separate haemorrhagic tissue fragment. AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a collapsed partially disrupted ovarian cyst 40 x 35 x 25mm.  There is overlying fallopian tube 65mm in length.  The fimbrial end of the tube cannot be definitively identified.  The ovary and fallopian tube AE 13 blocks.  (TO: FI:  CA/mm 25.9.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Z Mirkovich) 
A.  The specimen has been examined in its entirety.  Foci of endometriosis are present in the paradnexal soft tissues.  The ovary and tube are essentially unremarkable.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
B.  The specimen has been examined in its entirety.  The ovary shows an endometriotic cyst.  Foci of endometriosis are also present in theparadnexal soft tissues.  The fallopian tube shows a mild hydrosalpinx.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Both ovaries and tubes:  Endometriotic cyst and endometriosis.
