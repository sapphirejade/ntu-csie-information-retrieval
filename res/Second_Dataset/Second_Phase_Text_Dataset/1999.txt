The lesion is composed of spindle shaped tumour cells with wavy nuclei forming vague fascicles.  No significant mitotic activity is seen. Hypocellular areas, thick walled vessels, myxoid change and focal haemosiderin deposition are present. There is diffuse strong staining for S100. Neurofilament is negative.
