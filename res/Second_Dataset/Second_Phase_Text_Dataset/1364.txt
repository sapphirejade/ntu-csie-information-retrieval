CLINICAL:
Total gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of the stomach.  Consented to BioBank.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Stomach", consists of stomach 180mm in length along the greater curvature, 150mm in length along the lesser curvature and up to 115mm in circumference.  The attached greater omentum measures 220 x 140 x 40mm and the attached lesser omentum measures 120 x 40 x 15mm.  The oesophageal mucosa is identified at the proximal end for a length of 13mm.  Proximally within the body of the stomach and centred posteriorly there is a firm tumour 35 x30 x 7mm.  The tumour has a firm pale cut surface.  The tumour is 30mm from proximal and 130mm from distal resection margin.  The tumour does not appear to have penetrated beyond the muscularis propria.  There are several lymph nodes within the omentum.  The largest is within the lesser omentum and is 25mm in maximum dimension.  This lymph node has a pale indurated pale cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - paired sections tumour and proximal margin; 3 of tumour (reserved block); 4 - section of tumour; 5 - tumour and its proximal end; 6 - tumour and its distal end; 7 - shaved distal margin; 8 - one greater omentum lymph node bisected; 9 - ?lymph nodes as seen, greater omentum; 10 - ?lymph nodes as seen, lesser omentum; 11 - representative the indurated lymph node in lesser omentum; 12 - one bisected lymph node lesser omentum; 13 to 15 - sections of omentalfat looking for lymph nodes; 
(TO: VR;LN/vo 11.2.63) 
16 to 19 - remainder of the tumour; 20 to 29 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes YT
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Tarras):
