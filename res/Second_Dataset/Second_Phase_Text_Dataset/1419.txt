CLINICAL:
Caecal cancer.  Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of bowel received fresh and unopened containing ileum, caecum and large bowel which measures 200mm in length.  There is an attached appendix which measures 55 x 6mm and has an unremarkable appearance.  The caecum contains a large polypoid tumour which measures 55 x 60 x 25mm which is located 85mm from the distal margin and 55mm from the proximal margin.  The remainingmucosa is unremarkable.  No further polyps seen.  There is attached fat which measures 175 x 55mm.  Distal margin inked black, proximal margin inked blue.  On sectioning the tumour appears to abut the serosal surface and is 32mm in maximum thickness.  
Blocks:  1 - sections of distal margin; 2- section of proximal margin; 3 & 4 - composite blocks represent tumour at level of deepest invasion including opening of appendiceal orifice; 5 & 6 - composite blocks and further section of tumour at level of deepest invasion; 7 -reserved block; 8 - bowel mucosa proximal to tumour; 9 - tumour with distal mucosa; 10 - serosal surface deep to tumour; 11- apical lymph node; 12 & 13- lymph nodes; 14 - one lymph node bisected; 15-17 - lymph nodes; 18 - LS of the distal tip of appendix; 19 - TS mid appendix.
(TO: IB: XX/mm 5.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr E Robirds) 
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  A synoptic report follows.

Microscopic Description

Type

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Adenocarcinoma extends just beyond muscularis propria.
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  12	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1	
pN1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN 
Lymphovascular invasion
No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.
Perineural invasion
Not seen
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
The appendix is identified and shows no significant abnormality.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated withmicrosatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
