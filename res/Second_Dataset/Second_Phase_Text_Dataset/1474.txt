CLINICAL:
x2 breast cancers -one retro areolar and one R UOQ.  R mastectomy and axillary node dissection - level 1 & 2 .  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue suture medial"consists of a right mastectomy weighing 794g and measuring 195mm (medial to lateral) x 160mm (superior to inferior) x 42mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of skin on the superficial surface of the specimen measuring 195 x 82mm.  On the ellipse of skin, there is nipple areola complex over an area of 30 x 30mm.  There are two firm tan tumours identified.  Tumour one is retro areola and measures 32 x 20 x 40mm.  The tumour is 15mm from the superficial margin, 25mm from the deep margin, 50mm from the superficial margin, 20mm from the inferior margin, 50mm from the medial margin and 75mm from the lateral margin. The cut surface is firm and tan with a nodular architecture.  Tumour two is 15mm from the retro areola tumour laterally and measures 30 x 15 x 15mm.  The tumour is 22mm from the superficial margin, 10mm from the deep margin, 60mm from the superior margin, 55mm from the inferior margin, 15mm from the lateral margin and 145mm from the medial margin.  Tumour two is firm, nodular and has a small satellite nodule measuring 5 x 5 x 3mm associated with the main tumour.  The rest of the breast tissue is fibrofatty.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.  
Blocks: 1 - nipple areola complex; 2 to 6 - tumour one (2 & 3 - full face of tumour; 4 - tumour and closest superficial margin; 5- reserve block & 6 - tumour); 7 - tissue between tumour and deep margin; 8 - breast tissue between tumour one and tumour two; 9 to 13 - tumour two (9 - tumour two; 10 & 11 - Paired blocks, tumour two and closest superficial margin; 12 - tumour two and closest deep margin; 13 - tumour two and satellite lesion); 14 & 15 - lower inner quadrant; 16 & 17 - lower outer quadrant; 18 & 19 - upper outer quadrant; 20 & 21 - upper inner quadrant.
Please refer to attached diagram.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Axillary clearance" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 110 x 70 x 30mm.  There fourteen lymph nodes identified from 3 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - three lymph nodes; 2 - three lymph nodes; 3- two lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node bisected; 5 - one lymph node bisected; 6 - one lymph node bisected; 7 - one lymph node bisected; 8 - one lymph node bisected; 9 to 12 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 13 - two ?lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr L Grate)
A.  Sections of the right breast show two invasive ductal carcinomas. A synoptic report for invasive breast carcinoma follows:
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR BREAST CARCINOMA
Invasive carcinoma 1:
Site: Right breast, retroareolar.
Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma. 
Invasive tumour size: 40mm (macroscopic)
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 2
Tubules: 3   Nuclei:  2    Mitoses: 1   Mitotic rate: 1/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: Present - multifocal.
	    
Tumour 1 is composed predominantly of mild to moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells arranged in sheets and intersecting trabeculae with scattered infiltrative nests.
Invasive carcinoma 2:
Site: Right breast, right upper outer quadrant
Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma.
Invasive tumour size: 30mm (macroscopic)
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 1
Tubules: 2    Nuclei:      Mitoses: 1     Mitotic rate:  3/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: Present - multifocal.

Tumour 2 contains numerous infiltrative cribriform and solid nests, as well as, infiltrative trabeculae, small nests and cords. CK5/6 and P63 stains for myoepithelial markers are negative, consistent with an absent in situ component. The "satellite nodule" identified adjacent to tumour 2 macroscopically, appears identical tumour 2 and most likely represents a peripheral lobule of this tumour. 
The section of tissue sampled between the tumours 1 and 2 contains a small focus of invasive carcinoma, possibly indicating a "dumbbell tumour".

DCIS component:
DCIS: Not identified.  
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:
Tumour 1
Clear of margins (>10mm).

PR:  	POSITIVE
	85% of nuclei stained
	Predominant intensity of staining: Moderate to strong.  
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): Negative (1+)

Extranodal spread: Present, up to 0.25mm.
B.  Sections of the axillary clearance show foci of metastatic carcinoma in two of sixteen lymph nodes (ranging from 2.2 to 5.5mm). There is focal extranodal extension up to 0.56mm. 
Synoptic report for axillary lymph nodes:
