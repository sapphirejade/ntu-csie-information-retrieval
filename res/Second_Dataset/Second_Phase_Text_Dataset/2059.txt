D.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue suture axilla", consists of a breast 170mm (lateral to medial) x 140mm (superior to inferior) x 50mm (superficial to deep).  The overlying skin ellipse measures 155 x 80mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  No lesionsare seen on the skin.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  At 1 o'clock 25mm from nipple there is an ill-defined indurated pale solid mass 24 x 15 x 15mm.  The tumour is 42mm from superior, 60mm from inferior, 16mm from deep, 23mm from superficial, 55mm from lateral and 40mm from medial margin.  The tumour is 20mmfrom overlying skin.  There is punctate haemorrhage within the tumour.  10mm inferior to the tumour there is an apparent haemorrhagic area 10mm in maximum dimension.  In continuative with and lateral to the tumour there is a pale area with rubbery consistency extending 25mm lateral to the tumour.  Blocks: 1 - tumour (ER PR HER2 Ki67); 2 - deep margin closest to tumour (paired with block 1); 3 - tumour; 4 - tumour, reserved block; 5 and 6 - tumourand inferior haemorrhagic areas paired sections; 7 - tumour and closest superficial margin; 8 and 9 - pale area lateral to the tumour; 10 and 11 - upper outer quadrant; 12 and 13 - lower outer quadrant; 14 and15 - lower inner quadrant; 16 and 17 - upper inner quadrant; 18 - nipple; 19 - tissue behind nipple.  Please see the diagram.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary tissue stitch apex",consists of a piece of fatty tissue 110 x 38 x 25mm.  There is a suture marking the apex.  The identified lymph nodes are blocked from apex towards the opposite side.  Several lymph nodes are identified the largest is 26mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 and 3 - one lymph node; 4 - lymph nodes as seen; 5 - one bisected lymph node; 6 - one lymph node; 7 - lymph nodes as seen; 8 - one bisected lymphnode
F.  Specimen labelled "Left breast tissue on apex", consists of a breast 190 x 150 x 48mm with axillary tail 100 x 55 x 25mm.  There is a suture marking the apex of the axillary tail.  The overlying skin measures 170 x 70mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  Superficial margin is inked and deep margin is inked black.  The cut surfaces show a pale tumour at 3 o'clock 45mm from nipple measuring 15 x 22 x 12mm.  The tumour is 3mm from deep, 55mm from inferior, 65mm from superior, 50mm from lateral, 105mm from medial, 17mm from superficial and 15mm from the overlying skin.  At 12 o'clock 20mm from nipple extending laterally there is a poorly defined relatively firm area measuring 42 x 50 x 30mm.  The closest margin to this area is deep margin which is 10mm away.  All other margins are greater than 20mm.  This area is 45mm from the tumour.  The axillary tail is examined for lymph nodes.  The lymph nodes are blocked starting from the side of the tail closer to the breast towards the apex.
Blocks: 1 - tumour and deep margin (ER PR HER2 Ki67); 2 and 3 - paired sections tumour and closest superficial margin; 4 - tumour reserved block; 5 to 8 - representative sections of the ill-defined pale area blocked from medial to lateral; 9 and 10 - upper inner quadrant; 11 and 12 - lower inner quadrant; 13 and 14 - lower outer quadrant; 15 and 16 - upper outer quadrant; 17 - nipple; 18 - tissue behind nipple; 19 - one bisected lymph node; 20 - one bisected lymph node; 21 - lymph nodes as seen; 22 - one lymph node; 23 - one lymph node; 24 - one bisected lymph node; 25 - lymph node as seen.  Please see the diagram.

DCIS component:  
DCIS:  Absent
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:  Theinvasive carcinoma is 13mm to the superficial margin (block D3) and is 16mm to the deep margin (block D3).  The other margins are well clear.
