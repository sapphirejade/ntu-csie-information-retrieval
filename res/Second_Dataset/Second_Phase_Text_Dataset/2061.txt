D.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary.  The tube measures 55mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  The ovary is 35 x 20 x 10mm.  Adhesion bands are identified between ovary and fallopian tube.  The cut sections of the ovary show small cysts ranging from 3 to 6mm containing clear fluids.  Also there is a previously opened and collapsed cyst attached to the ovary measuring 20 x 10 x 15mm.  The inner surface of the cyst is smooth.  In the paraovarian soft tissue there is a tan nodule measuring 5 x 5 x 5mm contains possible papillary excrescences.  
Blocks:  1- representative section of fimbrial end; 2- representative section of fallopian tube; 3- representative section of paraovarian soft tissue; 4 to 6 - ovary.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal scar" consistsof an unorientated elliptical skin excision measuring 150 x 15 x 20mm.  On the skin surface there is a linear scar measuring 130 x 2mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  Specimen is serially transversely sectioned.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable. 
Blocks:  1- two ends; 2 to 4 - four transverse sections.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic adhesions" consists of a piece of tan fibrous tissue 5 x 5 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Lateral peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan tissue 55 x 25 x 15mm.  Specimen is serially transversely sectioned.  A cystic nodule is identified measuring 12 x 10 x 10mm, it contains clear fluid.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - sections of the cystic nodule; 3 & 4 - soft tissue.  AE.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral pelvic peritoneum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 130 x 55 x 5mm.  A nodule is identified on the surface 11mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1- representative section of peritoneum; 2 - macroscopically described nodule; 3- representative section of peritoneum.  
I.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 35 x 25 x 15mm.  Serially transversely sectioned.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  The entire specimen embedded in blocks 1 to 3.  
J.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of five lymph nodes rangingfrom 10 to 20mm. 
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node; 3- three possible lymph nodes.  
K.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes ranging from 20 to 30mm.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node.  AE.
L.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix with attached mesoappendix measuring 75 x 10 x 15mm.  The serosa is tan/brown smooth and shiny.  The appendiceal base is inked blue.  Specimen serially transversely sectioned.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - tip of the appendix; 2- base of the appendix; 3 & 4 - transverse section of middle portion ofappendix.  AE.
M.  Specimen labelled "Caecal adhesions" consists of a piece of tan tissue 7 x 5 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
N.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel adhesion" consists of three pieces of tan tissue 5mm each in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.
O.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic gutter" consists of a piece of tan tissue 20 x 10 x 10mm.  TAE 1 block.  (YQ/mm 26.11.64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Monnin):
A.  Paraffin sections show a serous implant with features suspicious for invasion. 
B.  Sections of the ovary show extensive involvement by borderline serous tumour with mild to moderate atypical epithelial proliferation.  In addition, an invasive serous autoimplant is seen.  The fallopian tube shows numerous non-invasive serous implants on the serosal surface as well as an invasive implant of serous tumour.  The invasive implant shows strong positive staining with ER and PR.
C.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is secretory.  The myometrium shows no significant abnormality.  Small non-invasive serous implants are present on the serosal surface as well as a single invasive serous implant.  
D.  The fallopian tube and para-ovarian soft tissue show non-invasive serous implants while the ovary shows a low grade borderline serous tumour.  
E.  Sections show a scar.There is no evidence of malignancy. 
F.  Sections show non-invasive serous implants.
G.  Sections show ovarian tissue containing low grade borderline serous tumour plus non-invasive serous autoimplants.  The para-ovarian soft tissue contains non-invasive and invasive serous implants. 
H & I.  Sections show non-invasive serous implants. 
J.  Two (2) of the three (3) lymph nodes identifiedshow nodal involvement by borderline serous tumour.
K.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified show nodal involvement by borderline serous tumour.
L - O.   Sections show non-invasive serous implants.
COMMENT:
Under proposed new terminology, invasive serous implants are equivalent to metastatic low grade serous adenocarcinoma. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A - O.  Right and left ovaries, uterus and cervix, right and left external iliac lymph nodes, appendix and peritoneal biopsies:
- Serous borderline tumours of both ovaries with both non-invasive and invasive serous autoimplants.
- Non-invasive and invasive serous implants on uterine surface and fallopian tube
- Non-invasive serous implants involving peritoneum, bladder, appendix and colonic adhesions. 
- Four lymph nodes showing nodal involvement by borderline serous tumour.
