ADDITIONAL REPORT (7/2/63)

CLINICAL:
Ductal carcinoma 2cm from nipple 9 o'clock.  Left breast mastectomy and axillary clearance. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left breast", consists of a mastectomy with attached axillary tail measuring 260mm (medial to lateral) x 120mm (inferior to superior) x 30mm (superficial to deep).  There is an overlying ellipse of skin 210mm (medial to lateral) x 88mm (inferior to superior).  Included is a nipple areolar complex measuring 40 x 30mm which appears unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked yellow andthe deep margin is inked black.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail from 2-25mm.  
A 9mm tumour is present at 9 o'clock position at 2cm from nipple (tumour 1). 
In the 10 o'clock position 40mm from the nipple there is a 10mm firm cream stellate lesion identified (tumour 2).
Block 1- tissue deep to 10'clock tumour 2; 2 & 3- tumour 2; 4 - tissue inferior to tumour 2r; 5 - tissue at superiormargin from tumour 2; 6 - tissue medial to tumour 2; 7 - tissue lateral to tumour 2; 8 - representative inner upper quadrant; 9 - representative inner lower quadrant; 10 - 9 o'clock tumour 1, 11 - tissue medial to tumour 1, 12 - representative outer upper quadrant; 13 & 14 - representative outer lower quadrant; 15 - nipple and tissue deep to nipple; (16 to 20 serial lymph nodes from apex to breast) 16 to 18 - lymph nodes; 19 & 20 - one lymph node serially sectioned. 
(TO: CM;KI/ec 23.7.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr K Filla)  
Sections show 2 separate invasive tumours at 9 o'clock 2 cm from nipple (tumour 1) andat 10 o'clock 4 cm from nipple (tumour 2) over a 40mm area. DCIS is present spanning both invasive lesions.

ADDITIONAL REPORT (2/7/63)

HER-2 IN-SITU HYBRIDISATION 

Signal Detection has been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche). 

BLOCK 2 

HER2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (nonamplified, diploid) 

Mean HER2 copy number per cell: 1.9 
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 1.3 
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.46 

BLOCK 11 

HER2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (nonamplified, polysomy) 

Mean HER2 copy number per cell: 3.8 
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 3.2 
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.18 

SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations): 
Negative: HER2/CEP17 < 1.8 
Equivocal: HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2 
Positive: HER2/CEP17 >2.2
