SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (21.7.64):
Tissue was sent to the HOLBROOK DISTRICT HOSPITAL Research Centre for MGMT testing.
DNAwas extracted from the paraffin block.  The DNA was bisulphite modified and subjected to pyrosequencing to amplify a region of the MGMT promoter in order to detect methylation.
The sample was tested twice with the appropriate controlsand was found to be unmethylated (2.5%) at the MGMT promoter region.
Reported by Dr O Mcguire.
Please note this test was performedin a research laboratory which is not NATA accredited.
