CLINICAL:
Low anterior resection for intussuscepting upper rectal tumour.  No obvious liver, lung or peritoneal metastases.  Hypertension.  Hypercholesterolemia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Low anterior resection" consists of a segment of bowel comprising of sigmoid colon and rectum measuring 400mm in total length and 60mm in open circumference.  The proximal margin is inked blue and the distal margin and surrounding rectalfat is inked green.  There is a large exophytic fungating tumour measuring 80 x 60 x 60mm present within the rectum.  The tumour is 80mm from the distal margin and is 50mm above the peritoneal reflection.  The tumour arises from the anterior antimesenteric portion of the colon.  The underlying muscle wall and serosa is retracted.  No macroscopic serosal involvement is seen.  There are two small polyps near the tumour each measuring 10mm in diameter.  The first polyp is 25mm proximal to the tumour and the second polyp is 40mm proximal to the tumour.  
Blocks:  1- LS proximal margin; 2 - LS distal margin; 3 to 8 - representative sections of tumour; 9 - first polyp; 10 - second polyp; 11 - sigmoid colon; 12 - rectum; 13 - reserved tumour block; 14 - one apical node trisected; 15 - one lymph node; 16 - two lymph nodes; 17 - one lymph node; 18 - two lymph nodes; 19 to 22 - one lymph node each; 23 - three lymph nodes; 24 - one lymph node; 25 - three lymph nodes.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of one donut measuring 30mm x 10mm x 15mm.  AE 1 block.  (IO/mm 25.12.62)

Tumour perforation:  No
For rectal tumours
Relation of tumour to anterior peritoneal reflection:	 Above
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not applicable
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  17
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (Mural/Extramural):  Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
- The two small polyps are hyperplastic polyps.  
- The distal donut (specimen B) shows no significant abnormality.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Not applicable
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
Summary - TNM 7th Edition

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Lower anterior resection - Adenocarcinoma (T3, N0, MX, R0).
B.  Distal donut - No significant abnormality.
