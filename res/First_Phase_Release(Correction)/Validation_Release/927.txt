CLINICAL:
Almost grade 1 endometroid adenocarcinoma on curettings.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubesand ovaries weighing 70g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  In the posterior uterine cavity there is a roughened polypoid area 33 x 30mm which occupies the majority of the posterior uterine surface.  The tumour appears to invade to a maximum depth of 18mm over a total thickness of 21mm.  On the anterior uterus there is a small roughened firm area 10 x 10mm which appears to invade to a depth of 12mm with a maximum wall thickness of 17mm.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 38mm with a maximum diameter of 6mm.  The right ovary measures 27 x 10 x 10mmand has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 42mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  The left ovary measures 28 x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - posterior uterine tumour up to deepest point of invasion; 9 - further representative anterior uterus; 10 - right tube; 11 - right ovary; 12 - left tube; 13 - left ovary; 14 -  reserve block.   (TO: RR; RR/ta  12/3/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Maline): 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 11mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinomaof the endometrium, depth 11mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.
