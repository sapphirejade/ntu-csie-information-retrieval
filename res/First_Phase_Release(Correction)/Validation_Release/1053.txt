DR Anh SHYLA Conn
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
G1 endometrial cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary + tube for frozen section" consists of cystic ovary 90 x 70 x 60mm with attached ?fallopian tube 60mm in length and 7mm in maximum dimension.  The ovary is filled with soft/brown material.  Two frozen sections. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 to 9 - representative sections of the cystic ovary; 10 - representative sections ?fallopian tube; 13-32 - extra sections. (No blocks 11 or 12).  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Haemorrhagic cyst, focal atypical epithelium. (also shown to Dr O Margarita)
Results to Dr Raefferty/O'Drude by Dr O Hinz at 2.55pm on 21/8/12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + Cervix, right tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix ?right fallopian tube and ?right ovary weighing 532g in total.  The uterus measures 150 x 115 x 110mm.  The anterior serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The posterior serosal surface is roughened (inked black).  The ectocervix measures 35 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is an endometrial tumour measuring approximately 85 x 75 x 25mm .The tumour appears to have infiltrated into the outer half ofthe myometrium.  There are seven myometrial and subserosal fibroids ranging from 10 to 70mm in maximum dimension.  All fibroids have whorled grey cut surfaces.  The largest fibroid contains small patchy foci of haemorrhage.  The ?rightfallopian tube is 35mm long and up to 12mm in diameter.  The ?right ovary measures 70 x 30 x 30mm.  It has a partially solid and partially cystic cut surfaces.  The cystic areas have a smooth lining with no papillary excrescences.  Attached to the left adnexal site of the body of uterus there is a piece of solid tan tissue, 40 x 30 x 3mm (?peritoneum, ?remnants of the left ovary) 
Blocks:  1 to 9 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix (2&3 - paired, 4&5 - paired, 6&7 - paired, 8&9 - paired); 10 to 20 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix (12&13 - paired, 14&15 - paired, 16 to 18 - in continuity, 19&20 - paired); 21 - section of tumour, reserved block for tumourbank; 22 & 23 - paired sections of tumour in relation to serosal surface (deepest macroscopic tumour penetration); 24 to 26 - representative, the largest fibroid; 27 - ?subserosal fibroid; 28 - representative ?right fallopian tube; 29 to32 - representative sections ?right ovary; 33 - representative, the left adnexal tissue.  (BA/mm 24.10.62) 
C.  Specimen labelled "Umbilical hernia" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue covered by peritoneal on one surface and measuring 60 x 55 x 10mm.  The specimen is serially sliced.  No indurated nodules are seen.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a pieceof fibrofatty tissue 95 x 60 x 18mm.  The specimen is serially sliced.  No indurated nodules are seen. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections. (GL/ta 24/10/62)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Solwold): 
A.  The ovary has been extensively sampled.  Most of the lesion shows a fibrotic cyst wall with extensive organised haemorrhage, haemosiderin and foamy macrophages.
In addition, there is residual epithelial lining focally with features of a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
B.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The main tumour has a maximum depth of 26mm througha wall 40mm thick.  However there is a non-contiguous focus of serosal grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (block 27) adjacent to endometriosis (not associated with ovarian tissue).  No definite lymphvascular invasion is seen.
Theectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
The right ovary is unremarkable.  The right tube is not identified.
C & D.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
COMMENT:
Given the extensive endometroid adenocarcinoma in the uterus and the unusual haemorrhagic appearance of the ovarian tumour, the ovarian tumour is favoured as a probable metastasis from the uterine tumour (however a synchronous primary cannot be totally excluded).
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with serosal involvement (see text above) and probable metastasis to the left ovary.
The omentum is negative.
