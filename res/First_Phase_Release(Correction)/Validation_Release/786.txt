CLINICAL:
Left breast pleomorphic lobular carcinoma.  Mastectomy + axilla clearance.  
Sutures:  Short superior, long lateral.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla level 1" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 80 x 50 x 15mmand a separate piece of fatty tissue 20 x 15 x 8mm.  The specimen is sliced and examined for lymph nodes.  Several lymph nodes are identified.  The largest lymph node is 22mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - lymph nodes as seen; 3 - one bisected lymph node; 4 - one bisected lymph node; 5 - one bisected lymph node; 6 & 7 - one slice lymph node;  8 - lymph nodes as seen.
B.  Specimen labelled"Left axilla level 2" consists of fatty tissue 55 x 35 x 10mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified 8 and 6mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 to 5 remainder of the tissue.  AE.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left breast stitch long lateral, short superior" consists of a mastectomy specimen 150 x 140 x 30mm.  The overlying skin measures 75 x 28mm bearing a nipple 12mm inmaximum dimension.  No lesions are identified on the skin.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  At 2 o'clock 40mm from the nipple there is an ill-defined pale firm tumour measuring 33 x 35 x 15mm.The tumour is 42mm from superior, 60mm from inferior, 1mm from deep, 25mm from superficial, 35mm from lateral and 90mm from medial margins.  Medial to and in continuity with the tumour, there are pale fibrous areas extending 45mm medially.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - paired sections, tumour in relation to the skin and deep margins (1 - shows superficial margin and skin, 2 - shows deep margin, ER, PR, Her-2, Ki 67 requested on block 2); 3 - tumour and deep margin; 4 - section of tumour reserved block; 5 - tumour and deep margin; 6 & 7 - sections of tumour; 8 - section lateral to tumour; 9 - representative lateral margin; 10 to 11 - sequentialsections medial to tumour; 13 - representative inferior margin closest to tumour; 14 - superior margin closest to tumour; 15 - section of nipple; 16 - tissue behind nipple; 17 & 18 - random sections upper inner quadrant; 19 & 20 - lower inner quadrant; 21 & 22 - lower outer quadrant; 23 & 24 - upper outer quadrant.  Please see the diagram.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Ducey)
A.  Sections of the left axillary lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma in nine of twelve lymph nodes (9/12). There is focal extranodal extension up to 1.1mm.
B.  Sections of the left axillary lymph nodes (level 2) show metastatic carcinoma in four of five lymph nodes (4/5). There is focal extranodal extension up to 0.56mm. 
C.  The left breast tumour is an invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma associated with multifocal ALH/LCIS. A synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows:
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA
Invasive carcinoma:
Site: Left breast (mastectomy).
Type: Invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. 
Invasive tumour size: 40mm (approx. microscopic size).
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 2
Tubules: 3     Nuclei: 2     Mitoses: 1     Mitotic rate:  Up to 1/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. 
	    
DCIS component:  
DCIS: Not identified.  
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:
Deep margin: Less than 0.1mm (focally) (no intervening ducts or acini).
Superficial margin: Tumour cells infiltrate within the subepidermal dermis. 
Remaining margins appear clear (>10mm). 
Receptors (Block C2): 
ER:  	POSITIVE
	% of nuclei stained: 95%
	predominant intensity of staining: moderate tostrong  
PR:  	POSITIVE
	% of nuclei stained: 2%
	predominant intensity of staining: weak
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 2+ (positive)
HER SISH:  Performed at Parker Hannifin, SWAN HILL DISTRICT HEALTH [SWAN HILL Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 index: Variable, up to 5% of tumour cell nuclei are positive. 
Nipple: No evidence of Paget's disease. 
LCIS / ALH: Present (multifocal). 
Miscellaneous: The adjacent non-neoplastic breast tissue shows fibrocystic change, apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis and scattered benign microcalcifications.
Sentinel lymph node(s):
Not included. 
Axillary/other nodes:
See specimens A and B.     
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left axilla level 1: Metastatic carcinoma in nine of twelve lymph nodes (9/12). Extranodal extension up to 1.1mm is present. 

B.  Left axilla level 2: Metastatic carcinoma in four of five lymph nodes (4/5). Extranodal extension up to 0.56mm is present. 

C.  Left breast (mastectomy):
Grade 2, 40mm, invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma with multifocal ALH/LCIS.
Invasive carcinoma is very close (less than 0.1mm) to the deep margin.
ER, PR (focal weak) and HER-2 positive.
See separate report for Her-2 SISH.
