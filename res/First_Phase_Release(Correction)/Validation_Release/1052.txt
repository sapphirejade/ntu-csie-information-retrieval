CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 114g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 70 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a tumour with A pale/tan appearance and friable surface within the endometrial cavity, measuring approximately 65 x 40 x 9mm in thickness.  The tumour appears to be confined within the inner half of the myometrium.  The myometrium contains four fibroids ranging from 5-21mm in maximum diameter.  
The right fallopian tube measures 60mmin length and up to 8mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 15mm.  Slicing the right ovary reveals a unilocular cyst 22 x 15 x 13mm.  The cyst has a smooth lining and is filled with clear fluid.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 17 x 10mm. There is a thin walled cyst attached to the fallopian tube 15 x 12 x 8mm. The cyst is filled with clear fluid.  There is an 8 x 7 x 7mm unilocular cyst within the left ovary.  The cyst has a smooth lining and is filled with clear fluid. 
Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4-7 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 8 - section of tumour, posterior body of uterus; 9 - section of tumour, posterior body of uterus, (reserve block for tumour bank); 10 - representative right fallopian tube; 11 - representative right ovary; 12 - representative left fallopian tube including one section from the paratubal cyst; 13 - representative left ovary; 14 - representative myometrial fibroid.  (OI/ec  23.10.62)  
     
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Tieu) 
Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The tumour shows some mucinous differentiation.  The tumour invades greater than 50% through the myometrium; maximum depth of myometrial invasion measures 13mm where total myometrial thickness is 24mm (block 8).  There is focal lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  There is also focal stromal invasion in the posterior endocervix (block 4).  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  The cervical tumour is greater than 10mm from the ectocervical excision margin.   
Endometrium away from the tumour shows exogenous hormone effect.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The described cysts in the right and left ovaries are simple cysts.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes are otherwise unremarkable.    
  



DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing greater than 50% myometrial invasion and cervical stromal involvement, stage 2.
