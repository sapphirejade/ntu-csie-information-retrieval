DR Oswaldo Junior MIRCHANDANI
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
?Ovarian cancer.  CA125= 4000.  Bilateral ovarian masses.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", received fresh for frozen section, consists of a cystic mass 80 x 50 x 30mm with a fallopian tube attached 50 x 5 x 5mm.  The capsule of the cystic mass is disrupted in one place.  On sectioning it has a variegated appearance with solid and cystic areas.  Two sections from the solid area for frozen section.  A small piece of tumour 5 x 2 x 2mm and one piece of normal ovary 5 x 2 x 2mm set aside for tissue bank.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section tissue; 3 to 8 - ten representative sections from tumour; 9 - two LS fimbria and one TSfallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma, favour serous.
Phone result to Anaesthetist by Dr R Melikian/Dr R Oman at 9.18am on 6/6/12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and left tube and ovary with a cystic mass weighing 552gin total.  The uterus measures 90 x 40 x 40mm and has a shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  On sectioning, it contains foci of adenomyosis.  The ovarian mass measures 130 x 100 x 70mm and has a cystic appearance.  The capsule appears disrupted in one area.  On sectioning it has a variegated appearance withsolid and cystic areas, areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The fallopian tube measures 100 x 15 x 15mm and appears to be covered by tumour deposits.
Blocks: 1 to 7 - fourteen representative sections of ovarian tumour; 8 - two LS left fimbria; 9 & 10 - two TS of fallopian tube with tumour; 11 to 13 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix;14 to 17 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 18 & 19 - two representative sections of tumour at the level of uterine adhesions; 20 - tumour for tissue bank
C.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a lymph node 15 x 10 x 10mm.  Macroscopically a tumour deposit is identified measuring 7 x 10 x 10mm.  BAE one block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes measuring 25 and 25mm in maximum diameter.  On sectioning, they appear replaced by tumour.:  1 - one representative section of one lymph node; 2 - one representative section of the second lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of tissue 50 x 40 x 20mm with two lymphnodes 25 and 22mm in maximum diameter.  On sectioning, they appear replaced by tumour.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one representative section of each lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum 180 x 120 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  No tumour deposits are identified.  Three representative sections in threeblocks.   (XO/cc 8/9/62)
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Stothard):
A & B.  Sections show poorly differentiated Mullerian carcinoma favoured as serous carcinoma.  A malignant transitional component may be present.  Carcinoma involves both ovaries, the left tube wall and lumen, the left fimbriae, the uterine serosa, small foci of myometrium, and extensive myometrial and cervical stromal lymphatics.
C.  One lymph node shows extensive metastatic carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is present, however venous invasion is seen in the surrounding fat.
D.  Two lymph nodes show extensive metastatic carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is present, however venous invasion is seen in the surrounding fat.
E.  Two lymph nodes show extensive metastatic carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
F.The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of both ovaries also involving the left tube, uterine serosa, myometrium, uterine lymphatics, and all five lymph nodes.
