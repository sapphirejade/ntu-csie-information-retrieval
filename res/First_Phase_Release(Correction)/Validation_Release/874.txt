CLINICAL:
Recurrent clear cell ovarian cancer.  Anemia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Rectal sigmoid pelvic mass" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 70mm in lengthwith an open circumference of up to 50mm.   Situated within the attached pericolic fat, 10mm from one resection margin, there is a circumscribed partly haemorrhagic fleshy tumour measuring 50 x 35 x 30mm.  The bowel mucosa appears shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 2to 6mm across.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - resection margin closest to tumour; 3 & 4 - opposite resection margin; 5 to 10 - tumour (block 10 - reserve block); 11 & 12 - four possible lymph nodes in each.    
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vaginal margin" consists of two irregular pieces of mucosa measuring 15 x 5mm to a depth of 3mm and 10 x 8mm to a depth of 3mm.  The mucosal surface appears unremarkable.  AE 3 blocks.
Blocks: 1 - small piece bisected; 2 & 3 - larger piece divided into six.  
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vaginal margin" consists of an ellipse of mucosa with underlying fatty tissue measuring 40 x 12mm to a depth of 15mm.  The mucosal surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The specimen is serially sectioned into thirteen consecutive slices andAE 9 blocks.
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of an elongated piece of fatty tissue measuring 70 x 25 x 20mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 5 to 15mm across.  AE 5 blocks.
Blocks: 1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected; 3 to 5 - remaining fatty tissue AE.  
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a 30mm fatty lymph node.  Lymph node divided into three and AE 3 blocks.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of three irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 15 x 5 x 5mm and 50 x 30 x 10mm.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 4 to 20mm across.  AE 7 blocks.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - two lymph nodes in each; 3 - three lymph nodes; 4 & 5 - one lymph node bisected; 6 & 7 - remaining fatty tissue.  
 
G.  Specimen labelled "Bowel donuts"consists of two separate mucosal donuts measuring 20 x 20 x 5mm and 20 x 20 x 8mm.  AE 3 blocks.
Blocks: 1 - one donut; 2& 3 - second donut.   (TO: AU; OQ/ta 29/1/62) 


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Millen):
A. Sections show a 50mm clear cell carcinoma, attached to the large bowel. There is no evidence of tumour invasion into the adherent large bowel. The lesion is entirely circumscribed and is completely surrounded by a cuff of fibrous tissue and mesenteric fat. The tumour is separated from the nearest inked surface of the specimen by 2.5mm of fat (A10).
8 lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
The lesion has an identical morphology to the previous specimen (95T690). The tumour cells have pleomorphic nuclei and cleared cytoplasm, and are forming papillae, glandular structures, cysts and solid sheets. Focal necrosis is present.
B. Sections show vaginal wall with mild chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show vagina wallwith acute on chronic inflammation and granulation tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D. 9 lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E. 1 lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F. 14 lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show large bowel with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Pelvic mass:
- Clear cell carcinoma attached to large bowel
- 8 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
- No evidence of invasion into large bowel
B. Posterior vaginal margin: chronic inflammation, no evidence of malignancy
C. Anterior vaginal wall margin: acute on chronic inflammation and granulation tissue, no evidence of malignancy
D. Left external iliac lymph nodes: 9 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
E. Left obturator lymph node: 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
F. Right external iliac lymph nodes: 14 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
G. Bowel doughnuts: no evidence of malignancy
