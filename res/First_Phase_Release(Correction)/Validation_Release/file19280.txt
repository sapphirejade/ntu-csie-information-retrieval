HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Previous colonic carcinoma, laparotomy, peritoneal nodule frozen section, peritoneal nodule, CRC, small intestine, peritoneal tumour.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;.  Severe pieces of tissues measuring 4 to 7mm in length.  There are areas of pale nodular surface up to 3mm in maximum diameter.  Some pieces are transected and all embedded for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Small suture granuloma, mild chronic inflammation, no tumour&amp;quot;.  Results was phoned to Dr. L. Faurot by Dr. L. Barone on 30.6.2065.

(1  frozen).  AE (M-1).

B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;.  Fat 8mm in maximum diameter with 6mm firm nodule in addition to two pieces of firm fibrotic tissue measuring 8mm and 5mm.

F/S:  &amp;quot;1 TS  of each piece including smears of the nodule and reported as two pieces of scar tissue and one piece of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with some goblet cell tumour features.  Difficult to cuton frozen section&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned to Dr. L. Manos by Dr L. Ciampanella on 28.7.2068.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder tissue).  AE (M-2).

C.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Multiple fragments of small bowel.  The largest fragment measures 450mm in length and up to 35mm in diameter with extensive adhesions and looping of multiple segments of bowel central specimen.  Received also seven segments of small bowel ranging between 3, 5 and 50mm in length.  Received also three separate firm fibrofatty pieces of tissue with overlying peritoneal covering measuring 10mm, 15mm and 25mm in maximum diameter.

The largest segment contains ragged, haemorrhagic areas between the adhesions over 75x30mm.  The cut surface reveals focal areas of firm white nodules with mucinous cut surface involving the bowel wall with no definite involvement of the underlying mucosa.

Similar ragged haemorrhagic areas are identified on the fragment of separate bowel with firm white and possible mucinous cut surfaces.

The separate nodules confirms firm white nodules infiltrating the underlying fat measuring 4mm, 6mm and 15mm respectively.

(1  large sperate nodule; 2  representative smaller nodules; 3-5  ragged areas at adhesion, largest bowel; 6-8  representative separate fragments).  RS (M-8/ZH/km).

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. L. Perard)
A.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Sections show moderately differentiated metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma including areas of extracellular mucin production.  The tumour is seen to involve fibrofatty tissue.

C.  Sections through the segments of bowel show fibrous adhesions associated with foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material.  Scattered epithelial inclusion cysts are also seen.  No tumour involvement of the small bowel segments is seen.

In addition there are separate metastatic deposits of moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma including metastatic carcinoma to one lymph node and involvement of extranodal fibrofatty tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  PERITONEAL NODULE :
-FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMATOUS REACTION TO SUTURE MATERIAL AND FIBROSIS.

B.  PERITONEAL NODULE :
-METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.

C.  SMALL BOWEL :
-FIBROUS ADHESIONS.
-SEPARATE METASTATIC DEPOSITS OF MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING FIBROFATTY TISSUE AND A LYMPH NODE.
