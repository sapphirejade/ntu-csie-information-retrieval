CLINICAL:
Hx:  neuroendocrine tumour of cervix on cervical biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue, 30 x 20 x 4mm containing a 20mm lymph node.  The lymph node is bisected and AE for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 - remaining fatty tissue.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Small cell carcinoma present.  
Phone result to anaesthetist by Dr V Vanosdel/V Furino at 9:55am on 23/1/13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Cervix & uterus" consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 76g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and shows a 20 x 10mm fungating exophytic tumour on its anterior lip.  The posterior ectocervix appears indurated over an area of 18 x 10mm.  The attached vaginal vault mucosa measures 60 x 21mm anteriorly and 55 x 12mm posteriorly.  The cut surface shows tumour invasion into the cervical stroma, 3mm from the anterior cervical neck margin.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximal thickness and the myometrium is 17mm in maximal thickness.  The superficial third of the myometrium has a pale cut surface.  The myometrium contains a single 15mm fibroid.  Representative sections in 43 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 to 23 - cervix anterior lip all embedded from right to left; 24 & 25 - four LS anterior body; 26 -fibroid; 27 to 38 - cervix posterior lip all embedded from left toright; 39 & 40 - full LS posterior body; 41 - right paracervical soft tissue; 42 & 43 - left paracervical tissue (block 12 - research block).  Please see attached diagram.
C.  Specimen labelled "High right external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 15 x 5mm containing a 20mm lymph node.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Distal right external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 5mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 16mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 & 3 - one lymph node in each.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right common paracaval lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x20 x 5mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 8mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 to 3- two lymph nodes in each.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 1 to 20mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - ? three lymph nodes in each.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left suspicious obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 45 x 12 x 5mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 3 and 24mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 5mm containing a single 38mm fatty lymph node.  Lymph node BAE 2 blocks.  
I.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a 10mm grey lymph node.  AE 1 block.  (TO: FP; FP/mm 25.3.63)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr V Jankoski) 
A.  The one lymph node shows a 2mm deposit of small cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is present.
B.  Sections show small cell / neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix anteriorly.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 11mm through a wall 13mm thick, length of 20mm and an estimated width of 15mm.  Prominent lymphatic invasion is present aswell as medium sized vessel invasion.  Stromal carcinoma is well clear of the vaginal margin (>10mm) however carcinoma within lymphatics is present 8mm from the vaginal margin.  
No AIS or CIN is seen.
The endometrium shows progestational effect.  The myometrium contains a benign adenomatoid tumour.  
C.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
I.One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Small cell / neuroendocrine carcinomaof the cervix, depth 11mm through a wall 13mm thick, length 20mm, width 15mm.  Lymphatic and vessel invasion present.  One of 24 lymph nodes shows metastatic carcinoma.
