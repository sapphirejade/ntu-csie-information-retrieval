CLINICAL:
57yr old.  Interval debulking for ovarian cancer.  Diaphragm peritoneal stripped with repair of diaphragm defect.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 238g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 60 x 40mm with a roughened surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The anterior uterine body is inked blue, posterior black.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 25mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with amaximum diameter of 8mm.  The right ovary consists of a complex solid and cystic mass measuring 70 x 45 x 45mm.  The mass is approximately 50% solid and 50% cystic. The solid areas have a cream fleshy and haemorrhagic variegated appearance.  The cystic areas contain multiloculated cysts filled with haemo serous material with a wall thickness of approximately 1 to 2mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 80mm in length with a maximum diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary consists of a solid and cystic mass measuring 75 x 55 x 50mm. On sectioning this mass appears to be continuous with the right ovary.  This mass is also 50% solid and 50% cystic. The solid areas have a fleshy cream and haemorrhagic variegated appearance. The cystic areas contain a yellow fluid and are predominately thin walled with a wall thickness of 1mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS through anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS through posterior body and cervix; 7 - right cornu; 8 - left cornu; 9 - LS of right fallopian tube; 10 - representative TS right fallopian tube; 11 to 14 - representative right ovarian mass; 15 - Left ovarian mass; 16 - representative TS left fallopian tube; 17 - to 23 - representative left ovarian mass.   
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node"consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40 x 10 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Paraaortic lymph node" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm.   Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - remaining tissue.
E.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 7mm.  The tissue is covered with cream nodulardeposits.  Representative sections in 4 blocks.  Approximately 80% is embedded. 
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon nodule" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Right diaphragm" consists of a sheet of fibrous and muscular tissue measuring 110 x 45 x5mm.  Representative sections in 5 blocks.  
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of an omentum measuring 190 x 110 x 10mm.  In the omentum there is one nodule measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.  This nodule has a cream cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative nodule; 3 - representative omentum.(CQ/ta 16/10/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Tomas): 
A. Sections show moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma, involving both ovaries.  Tumour is also present on the serosal surface ofthe uterus, plus the outer half of the myometrium in the left cornu and anterior body of the uterus. Focal lymphovascular invasion is present.
The lesion has a complex glandular and papillary architecture, and is composed ofglands and papillae lined by tumour cells with markedly enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Psammoma bodies are seen.
The endometrium appears atrophic and shows no evidence of malignancy.
The cervix is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of a HPV effect or CIN.
The fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
Representative sections shown to Dr VANNESSA Pabst.
B. Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma, up to 6 mm in size, in 3 out of 6 lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of extranodal spread.
E and F. Sections show fibrous tissue and fat metastatic with adenocarcinoma.
G.  Sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma in fibrous tissue and fat.  The underlying skeletal muscle appears uninvolved.
H.  Sections show a 20 mm nodule of metastatic adenocarcinoma within omental fat.
DIAGNOSIS
A to H. Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, right and left external iliac lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph node, pouch of Douglas, descending colon nodule, right diaphragm and omentum:
- Bilateral ovarian moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma in outer half of uterine wall, pouch of Douglas, descending colon, right diaphragm and omentum
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma in 3 out of 8 lymph nodes (positive nodes from para-aortic lymph nodes)
