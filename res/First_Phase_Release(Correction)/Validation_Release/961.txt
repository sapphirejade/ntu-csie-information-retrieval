SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.5.64):  


CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.   Previous oophorectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of uterus with attached cervix and right fallopian tube weighing 104g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 40mm.  The cervix measures 20 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On opening the endometrium on the posterior body has a small friable area measuring 5mm diameter.  The thickness of the myometrium is generally 5mm but near the tumour on the posterior wall is 10mm.  The anterior myometrium has multiple fibroids up to 10mm diameter.    
Blocks: 1 to 4 - one full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - two representative sections of anterior endomyometrium; 7 to 10 - one full LS posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - representative sections of posterior endomyometrium; 13 ? Right cornua 14 - right parametrial tissue; 15 - left parametrial tissue; 16 -? Left cornua.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal wall" consists of two irregular pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 60 x 20 x 15mm and 80 x 30 x 10mm.  On sectioning they have a fibrous appearance.  No tumour massesare identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.   (TO:EK/ta 5/8/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Hosten): 
A.  Sections of the endometrium shows a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The tumour consists of complex and branched endometrial glands lined by atypical columnar epithelial cells.  There is some squamous metaplasia however no areas of solid growth are seen.  There is superficial myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of invasion is 4mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 10mm.  There is no lymphovascular invasion.  There is probable focal tumour involvement of the surface of the endocervix but no cervical stromal invasion is seen; the focus of probable surface cervical involvement is 14mm from the ectocervical margin.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  The endometrium away from the tumour is inactive.  Several benign leiomyomas are confirmed.  The parametrial tissue is unremarkable. 
B. Sections from the abdominal wall show skeletal muscle and adipose tissue with marked fibrosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.






DIAGNOSIS:
A.Uterus: 
1.  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, grade 1.  Superficial myometrial invasion (mm out of total myometrial thickness of 10mm).  Probable focal involvement of surface epithelium of endocervix.  Stage 1A.
2.  Leiomyomas.
B.  Abdominal wall:  Fibrosis.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.5.64):  
A.  Stains for mismatch repair enzymes have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
