CLINICAL:
R leg sarcoma.  R lower lobe (lung) mass + lymph nodes. 
Additional history (Pathology Report: Dr J Denis RENAL CLINIC Pathology Service - JS-86-790183 5.6.62): High grade right thigh myxofibrosarcoma, present at margins. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Hilar lymph node", consists of two black lymph nodes 10mm in diameter.  Block 1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
B.  Specimen labelled "Paratracheal lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x 15 x 10mm with one lymph node 10mm in maximum diameter. AE.
Block 1 - bisected lymph node; 2 - rest of fatty tissue.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right lung", consists of a right lung measuring 170 x 180mm. It weighs 236g before fixation.  In the right mid right aspect of thespecimen there is a mass 70 x 50 x 50mm.  On sectioning the tumour is located 20mm from the bronchial margin. The cut surface of the tumour is solid with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  
Block 1- bronchial margin; 2- vascular margin; 3 - two peribronchial lymph nodes; 4 - one peribronchial lymph node; 5 - LS of tumour close to bronchial margin; 6-9 - tumour (block 9 reserve block); 10 - non-tumoral lung.  (TO: PG: PG/ec 25.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Matot)
A.  Sections of the four hilar lymph nodes show reactive anthrasilicosis. There is no evidence of malignancy (0/4).  
B.  Sections of the threeparatracheal lymph nodes show reactive anthrasilicosis. There is no evidence of malignancy (0/3).  
C.  Sections of the right lung show a 70mm sarcomatoid tumour. The tumour is unencapsulated and predominantly circumscribed. The tumour is composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells with moderate to markedly pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and varying amountsof eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour is moderately to highly cellular and the tumour cells are arranged in sheets within variably prominent myxoid stroma. Mitoses are readily identified. At least 33% of the tumour appears necrotic. Tumour is clear of the pleural surface (2.2mm). The bronchial resection margin appears clear of tumour (10mm). The vascular resection margin shows no involvement by tumour. Three sampledhilar lymph nodes show reactive anthrasilicosis (0/3). The section of non-neoplastic lung shows no significant histologic abnormality. 
Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:
Tumour cells positivefor: Vimentin, CD68 (focal), Cam5.2 (focal) and MNF-116 (focal). 
Tumour cells negative for: CD34, desmin, SMA, myogenin, myoglobin, S100TTF-1.
A ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights up to 75% of viable tumour cell nuclei.
COMMENT:
The right lung tumour is a 70mm high gradesarcomatoid tumour with myxoid stroma. The tumour shows very focal cytokeratin positivity and TTF-1 is negative. This lung tumour has been compared to thepreviously reported right thigh myxofibrosarcoma (JS-86-790183 5.6.2062). The tumours appear identical and have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, including focal cytokeratin positivity (although the thigh tumour was reported as being cytokeratin negative). Overall, the 70mm lung tumour shows features consistent with metastatic high grade myxofibrosarcoma. 
Representative slides seen with Dr VINCENT Latourette.
Please correlate with clinical and imaging findings. 

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Hilar lymph node: No evidence of malignancy in four lymph nodes (0/4). 

B.  Paratracheal lymph node: No evidence of malignancy in three lymph nodes (0/3). 

C.  Right lung: 
70mm high grade sarcomatoid tumour, consistent with metastatic high grade myxofibrosarcoma (see comment). 
Bronchial and vascular margins, as well as, pleural surface, appear clear of tumour.
No evidence of malignancy in three sampled perihilar lymph nodes (0/3).
