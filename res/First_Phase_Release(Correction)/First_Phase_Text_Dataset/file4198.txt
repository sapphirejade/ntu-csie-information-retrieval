SEALS HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

HISTORY:
1. Peritonectomy - peritoneum, rectum, colon, omentum, gallbladder. 2. Excision scar.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, RECTUM, RIGHT COLON, DIATHRAM, PERITONEUM&amp;quot;. Specimen comprises of gallbladder, omentum, right hemi, fragment of large bowel consistent with rectum, and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum. Gallbladder measures 60mm in length x 23mm in maximum diameter. The wall is up to 2mm thick. Serosa is smooth, mucosa is granular, green in appearance, with patchy cholesterolosis. No stones. (1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).
- Right hemicolectomy.
Terminal ileum and ascending colon, caecum and attached mesocolic fat, 200 mm in length.
The mesocolic fat is up to 70 mm wide. Terminal ileum 130 mm, ascending colon 90mm.  Appendix is not present. Over inferior caecum are multiple small deposits of pale tumour with a plaque-like distribution. Also noted are the serosal surface of the small bowel and ascending colon and mesocolic fat are similar plaque-like deposit of tumour mostly around 5 mm diameter. On opening the mucosa is unremarkable. (3 proximal and distal margin; 4 tumour adherent to terminal ileum; 5,6,7 tumour at appendiceal site [7 includes ?appendiceal orifice]; 8 tumour on surface of mesocolic fat; 9-12 lymph nodes within mesocolic fat [9 one lymph node bisected; 10 four lymph nodes; 11 one lymph node; 12 one lymph node bisected]).
- A piece of large bowel consistent with rectum. 350mm in length. Attached mesocolic fat is up to 70mm. The adherent peritoneum measuring up to 250 mm wide. The serosal surface shows nodular/plaque-like deposits of tumour, especially at the proximal aspect and it extends into the mesocolic fat and adherent peritoneum. On opening, the mucosa shows 14 polyps, ranging from 2-4mm in maximum dimension. (13&amp;amp;14 seven polyps each; 15 tumour deposits, proximal and of large bowel; 16 tumour deposits, distal and of large bowe; 17 tumour deposits, mid-large bowel; 18 peritoneum adherent to mesocolic fat includes tumour deposits; 19 one further section of peritoneum showing tumour deposits. Also noted are multiple diverculae; 20 representative sections of diverticulae; 21 four possible lymph nodes).
- Omentum. Two pieces of omentum, all together it measures 470mmx240mmx20mm. On the surface are multiple plaque-like deposits of tumour.  (22&amp;amp;23 omentum showing tumour deposits).
- Multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum, in aggregates 150x140x25mm. One of the pieces shows plaque-like deposits of tumour similar to the rest.
(24 sections of peritoneum showing tumour deposits; 25 tumour block). RS (M-25)

B. &amp;quot;EXCISION SCAR&amp;quot;. Consists of an ellipse of skin with underlying subcutaneous tissue. It measures 35x8mm and is up to 15mm in depth. There is a scar, measuring 12mm in length. Resection margin is inked blue. It is sectioned from one end to the other into 10 transverse slices. On sectioning, the cut surface reveals an area of fibrosis. RS (M-4/ MC/cy)

MICROSCOPIC:  Y. Hosfield
A.  The deposits of tumour over the bowel surfaces and omentum and peritoneum show multiple deposits of epithelial type malignant mesothelioma. There is invasion into subserosal tissue of small bowel and colon.
Other:
Gallbladder shows mild cholesterolosis.
Sampled mesenteric lymph nodes are negative.
There are several colonic hyperplastic polyps.
B. Sections show skin and subcutis with a dermal and subcutaneous fibrous scar with suture granulomas. Tumour is not seen.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Peritonectomy specimen: Extensive peritoneal involvement by diffuse malignant mesothelioma, epithelial type.

B. Excision scar: Scar tissue and suture granulomas.
