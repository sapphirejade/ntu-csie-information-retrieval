SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT(8.6.63):


CLINICAL:
Serous carcinomapost chemotherapy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 79g in total. The uterus measures 65 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and shows a 5mm polyp along its anterior lip.  The endometrium along the anterior body has a diffuse granular appearance.  A 30 x 15 x 12mm tan polyp appears to arise from the posterior endometrium.  On sectioning the myometrium is 10mm in maximal thickness. The myometrium is unremarkable. The right ovary measures 15 x 11 x 10mm and has a smooth external surface.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length, 5mm in external diameter and appears unremarkable. The left ovary measures 20 x 11 x 10mm and has a smooth external surface.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length, 5mm in external diameter and appears unremarkable.  Representative sections in 27 blocks. 
Blocks 1-3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4- anterior cervix with polyp; 5 & 6 - further representative section anterior body; 7-10 - LS posterior body and cervix; 11-17 - remainderof the endometrial polyp, AE; 18 & 19 - right ovary, AE; 20-22 - right fallopian tube AE; 23 & 24 - left ovary, AE; 25-27 - left fallopian tube, AE. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes", consists of an irregular pieceof fatty tissue measuring 60 x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 5-11mm across.  AE in 4 blocks.  
Block 1- one lymph node bisected; 2 -three lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - remaining fatty tissue. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph nodes", consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 10 x 10mm containing a single 38mm fatty lymph node. AE in 4 blocks.
Block 1-3 - lymph node divided into four; 4 - remaining fatty tissue.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reportedby Dr E Shadix) 
A.  Sections of the endometrial polyp show involvement of around 50% of the polyp by serous carcinoma.  This partly has features of intraepithelial carcinoma but also invades the endometrial stroma.  There is no directmyometrial invasion.  There is lymphovascular invasion in the endometrium and also focally in the superficial myometrium.  There are also quite extensive small foci of calcification in small vessels throughout the myometrium, suggesting previous more extensive lymphovascular invasion, now with treatment effect.  The endometrium and myometrium are otherwise unremarkable and the cervix is not involved.
Microscopic deposits of serous carcinoma are seen in both ovaries and at the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes; these are favoured to be metastatic from the endometrial tumour but could possibly have arisen as part of a field change of the Mullerian epithelium.  Serous carcinoma is also seen in lymphovascular channels at the distal ends of both fallopian tubes.  No carcinoma in-situ of the tubal epithelium is seen.
B.  A total of four (4) lymph nodes were identified and theseare all free of tumour. 
C.  Sections show one (1) lymph node.  There are isolated tumour cells within the subcapsular and medullary sinuses.
Representativeslides have also been viewed by Dr E Gesualdi.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  
1.  Serous carcinoma in endometrial polyp.  
2.  Microscopic foci of serous carcinoma in both ovaries and both fallopian tubes, favoured to be metastatic from endometrium.
 
B.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4).
C.  Left obturator lymph nodes:  Metastatic serous carcinoma focally in one node (1/1).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (8.6.63):
Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MSH2:    Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6:    Preserved nuclear staining
MLH1:    Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2:    Preserved nuclear staining
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatchrepair enzymes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (3.1.63):
A.  Immunostains for hormone receptors have been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.
                                   100% of tumour cells show positive staining
                                   Predominant intensity of staining:  Moderate
Progesterone receptor:   Negative.  0% of tumour cells show positive staining.
