(47X699897U) 47X69989,47X69989 HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

HISTORY: Grade 2-3 endometrioid endometrial ca on curettage.  Uterus, bilateral tubes + ovaries, cervix.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES + OVARIES + CERVIX&amp;quot;.  Uterus with attached cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries.  Specimen was received partly divided coronally into anterior and posterior halves.  Anterior paracervix margin inked blue, posterior black.  Uterus with attached cervix weighs 117g and measures 75mm superior to inferior, 35mm intercornual distance; ectocervix is 25x20mm with a slit like os 3 mm. Anterior endomyometrium is 30mm, posterior endomyometrium is 30mm.  The endometrium is less than 1mm thick away from the tumour (see below).  Ectocervix is skin coloured and unremarkable.  Serosa is smooth. Within the endometrium is a large sessile largely exophytic papillary and friable tumour mass with a pale solid cut surface. The tumour measures 45x35mm and is up to 30mm in thickness and is located mostly anteriorly.  The cut surface shows no obvious invasion but there are pale areas in myometrium ?adenomyosis. The myometrium is 20 mm thickness. (1 right parametrium; 2 left parametrium; 3-11 right half [3 anterior cervix, 4 anterior lower uterine segment; 5 anterior endomyometrium, 6 posterior endomyometrium, 7 posterior lower uterine segment, 8 posterior cervix]; 9-12 second slice [9&amp;amp;10 CS anterior endomyometrium, 11&amp;amp;12 posterior endomyometrium, 13-20 taken from the first slice left half [13 anterior endomyometrium, 14 anterior lower uterine segment, 15&amp;amp;16 CS anterior endomyometrium, 17 fundus, 18 posterior endomyometrium, 19 lower uterine segment posterior endomyometrium; 20 posterior cervix]; 21-26 second slice [21&amp;amp;22 CS anterior endomyometrium, 23&amp;amp;24 CS anterior endomyometrium, 25&amp;amp;26 posterior endomyometrium].  Please see diagram for block orientation).  The right ovary and tube weighs 6g. The fallopian tube is 30mm in length x10mm maximum diameter.   Ovary measures 25x15x6mm.  No lesions seen. The left ovary and fallopian together weigh 8g. Fallopian tube measures 42mm in length x 10mm maximum diameter. There is a 7mm paratubal cyst.  The left ovary is 20x12x7mm. Serosal surface is smooth.  On sectioning through the fallopian tube the cyst is filled with gelatinous material, the lining is otherwise smooth.  On sectioning through the left ovary the cut surface is firm and normal appearing. (27 fimbrial end right fallopian tube; 28 two TS right fallopian tube; 29 two TS right ovary; 30 fimbrial end left fallopian tube; 31 TS left fallopian tube; 32 two TS left ovary).

MICROSCOPIC:   Reported by K. Braner
The endometrioid carcinoma has solid growth in the luminal parts and the invasive component has more glandular differentiation overall favouring grade 3. There is myometrial invasion posterior wall towards fundus and fundus proper. The more exophytic polypoid parts of the tumour (anterior wall) do not have underlying invasion in the sections.

Immunostains for DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) proteins block 41:
MLH1, PMS2:  ABNORMAL - loss of staining
MSH2 and MSH6:  Normal staining (intact expression)
Comment:
Mismatch repair deficient tumour.
Tumours that show loss of MMR proteins are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI-H).   MSI in endometrial (and colorectal) cancer results from defective DNA MMR, either due to germline-inactivating DNA MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome patients), or epigenetic inactivation of the MLH1 gene by promoter hypermethylation (sporadic tumors).   Epigenetic (sporadic) cause of MSI is more common than Lynch syndrome.
