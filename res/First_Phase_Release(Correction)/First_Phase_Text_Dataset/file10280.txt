tap0CLINICAL:
081Total pancreatectomy for separate head of pancreas and body/tail tumours.  Silk on bile duct.  1 x long prolene on PV.  2 x long prolene on SMA.  3 x long prolene on uncinated proc ess.  Left hilar lymph nodes.


MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Total pancreatectomy&amp;quot;, consists of a total pancreatectomy including spleen, duodenum and gallbladder.  081
The pancreas measures 135 x 40 x 18mm.  There are two tumo urs identified within the head and body/tail of the pancreas.  The pancreas is inked as follows; the uncinate process - black, the portal vein margin &amp;#8211; red, the superior mesente ric artery margin &amp;#8211; green, anterior pancreatic surface &amp;#8211; blue, and posterior pancreatic surface &amp;#8211; black.
Tumour one within the pa ncreatic head measures 30 x 30 x 30mm and appears centred at the ampulla.  The tumour appears to abut the anterior pancreaticsid8069124  surface, is at the SMA margin and abuts the unci nate process.  It is approximately 10mm from the portal vein margin.  The tumour infiltrates through the overlying  duodenal submucosa.
Tumour two is within the pancreatic tail and measures 25 x 17 x 17mm.  There are possible satellite nodules within the splenic hilum fat ra nging from 3 to 5mm.  The tumour appears to abut the anterior surface of the pancreas and is approximately 3mm from the posterior surface. The tumour is well away from the vascular mar gins and uncinate process. The splenic parenchyma appears unremarkable.  The pancreatic parenchyma between tumour one and tumour two is unremarkable.  angfe3081
The spleen d14378016measures 110 x 30 x 50mm and has a smooth outer capsule.  On sectioning the spleen has a gritty dark brown appearance. A sheet of fibrofatty tissue is attached to the spleen measuring approximately 160 x 50 x 5 0mm.  No discrete lesion is seen within the fibrofatty tissue.
The gallbladder measuring 150 x 50 x 4 0mm and has a smooth outer surface.  The wall thickness is 3mm and the mucosa is dark green and velvety. The common hepatic duct measures 18 x 5 x 5mm, and is unremarkable.081
The duodenum measures 145mm in length x 50mm in open diameter.  A section of the antrum is present at the proximal end over 50 x 20mm.  The wall thickness is up to 5mm  and the mucosa is unremarkable.  No polyps or lesions are seen.

Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; common he patic duct margin; 2 &amp;#8211; distal duodenal margin; 3 &amp;#8211; proximal antral margin; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;#8211; gallbladder; 6 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;#8211; attached omental fat; 8 &amp;#8211; representative norm al spleen; 9 to 14 &amp;#8211; tumour one at head of pancreas; 15 to 24 &amp;#8211; tumour two at tail of pancreas; 23 &amp;amp; 24 &amp;#8211; satellite nodules at splenic hilum; 25 &amp;amp; 26 &amp;#8211; possible lymph nodes along peri-duo denal fat.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot; Left hilar lymph nodes &amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40  x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 14mm in maximum dimension.  Specimen AE.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 &amp;#8211; one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 &amp;#8211; one lymph node serially sect ioned; 4 &amp;#8211; rest of tissue AE.
