CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrial cancer on hysteroscopy/curettage and polypectomy.  Now TLH BSO.  Pelvic lymphadenectomy and washings for staging.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 56g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 35 x 35mm and has a smoothshiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is a roughened nodule in the endometrium of the posterior body and fundus.  This measures 10 x 12mm and up to 8mm thick.
The right fallopian tube measure 50mm in length and is 5mm in maximum diameter. The right ovary measures 35 x 12 x 7mm. The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and is 5mm in maximumdiameter. There are multiple small cysts attached to the fimbriae ranging from  7 x 5 x 3 mm to 4 x 4 x 2mm. The cysts have a smooth surface. The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 5mm in maximum diameter.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of the posterior body and cervix; 7 to 9 - sections of the sub-endometrial lesion; 10 - right fallopian tube and fimbriae; 11 - representative sections of right ovary; 12 - section of left tube and fimbriae and a parafimbrial cyst; 13 - LS of another parafimbrial cyst; 14 - representative sections of left ovary.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 70 x 30 x 15mm.
Blocks: 1 - four lymph nodes; 2 - four lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node and a second possiblelymph node material; 4 - one lymph node bisected.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of adipose tissue measuring 50 x 50 x 20mm.
Blocks: 1 - four lymph nodes; 2 - onelymph node; 3 - one lymph node bisected.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 50 x 40 x 20mm
Blocks: 1 - three lymph nodes; 2 lymph nodes.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 50 x 40 x 20mm.
Blocks: 1 - six lymph nodes; 2 - three lymph nodes; 3 - possible lymph node material.   (TI/ta 4/8/63) 

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Matteucci): 
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  There is superficial myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 3mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 11mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  Left paratubal cysts are confirmed.  
B.  Sections show eleven lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
C.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
D.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
E.  Section show nine lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium with <50% myometrial invasion, stage 1A.  
B.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/11).  
C.  Left obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
D.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
E.  Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/9). 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (14.4.63)
There was a mistake in the original report in the diagnosis line of specimen A.  This has now been corrected (from grade 1A to stage 1A).
