Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
A large right adnexal mass 13cm.  No LN&amp;apos;s or metastatic disease.  CA 125 13-&amp;gt;26-&amp;gt;42.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of a large multiloculated cystic mass measuring 135 x 60 x 40mm and attached tube remnant 70 x 15 x 10mm.  The tube contains cysts between 2 to 7mm and the cystic mass has cysts between 2 to 40mm in size.  No papillary projections or solid component is identified on sectioning.  The cyst is filled with clear, yellow fluid. Block 1 &amp;amp; 2 - frozen section; 3 to 8 - RS cystic tumour; 9 - fimbrial end and TS tube; 10 - tube and associated cystic tumour; 10 &amp;amp; 11 - RS ? ovarian remnant of tumour; 12 to 15 - RS cystic tumour.

FROZEN SECTION:
Benign serous cystadenoma.
Result to Dr Germain (anaesthetic reg) by Dr R Guardia on 19.12.16 at 3:13pm.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, cervix&amp;#8220;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix measuring 85 x 60 x 22mm with cervix measuring 22 x 10mm. The total specimen weight is 55g.  Attached to the posterior surface of the endometrium are two polyps measuring 5 x 3 x 3mm and 6 x 5 x 5mm each.  The endometrium is up to 1mm thick with the myometrium 16mm in maximum thickness. Within the myometrium is a submucosal fibroid measuring up to 10mm in maximum size. The surface of the cervix is unremarkable.  Blocks 1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix, including fibroid; 5 to 7 - full LS posterior body and cervix including part of smaller polyp; 8 - LS posterior cervix with remainder of polyp.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of tube and attached ovary with tube measuring 50mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm and ovary measuring 45 x 20 x 20mm. The ovary has a cystic structure attached to one end occupying the majority of the ovarian tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 20mm.  The cystic structure on the ovary is filled with thin clear fluid and has a smooth inner lining with no papillary projections identified.   On sectioning the ovary contains multiple cysts between 2-20mm in size.   Block 1- fimbrial end and TS tube; 2 - RS ovary; 3 - RS cystic area.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omental biopsy&amp;#8220;, consists of a piece of omentum measuring 80 x 70 x 12mm.  Specimen serially sliced.  No solid tumour identified on sectioning. RS 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Clenney):
A.   Sections of the ovary show a serous cystadenoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.   The ectocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endocervix contains a benign endocervical polyp. The endometrium is predominantly inactive with polypoid cystic atrophy.  The myometrium contains a sclerosed leiomyoma and very focal adenomyosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.   Sections of the ovary show a serous cystadenoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

D.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.   Right fallopian tube and ovary:  Benign serous cystadenoma.

B.   Uterus and cervix:
-     Polypoid endometrial cystic atrophy and benign endocervical polyp.
-     Sclerosed leiomyoma.

C.   Left fallopian tube and ovary:  Benign serous cystadenoma.

D.   Omentum:  No significant abnormality.
