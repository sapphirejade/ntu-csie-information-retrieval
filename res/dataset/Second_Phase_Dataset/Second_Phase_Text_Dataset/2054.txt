CLINICAL:
Wide local excision of nodule in lateral aspect mastectomy wound ?recurrent breast cancer.  Excision with ellipse of skin.  Deep aspect on muscle.  Marking sutures:  Long lateral, short superior, medium medial.  Further excision of superior border.  Marking suture on side of cavity.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Recurrent breast cancer left breast" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with an ellipse of skin on the surface measuring in total 55mm (medial to lateral) x 65mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (superficial to deep).  The tissue has three marking sutures as designated and there is a ellipse of skin on the surface measuring 60 x 20mm with a linear scar measuring 50mm in length.  The specimen is inked as follows:  Superior red, inferior green, anterior blue, deep black and serially sectioned into eight slices from medial to lateral.  Within slicestwo and three there is a firm white tumour measuring 12 x 10 x 8mm.  The tumour margins are as follows:  Abuts the skin surface, 2mm anterior, 1mm deep, 8mm superior, 32mm inferior well away (approximately 60mm) lateral, and 12mm medial.The rest of the breast tissue appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - slice one medial margin, AE from superior to inferior; 4 & 5 - paired blocks, slice two; 6 - superior aspect of slice three; 7 - superior aspect of slice four; 8 - representative sections through lateral margin, slice eight.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast near superior border" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with a suture at one end marking cavity and measuring 50 x 30 x 8mm.  The cavity side is inked black and the opposite side is inked blue.  On sectioning no mass or lesion is identified within the fibrofatty tissue.  Representative sections in 3 blocks (60% of the specimen AE).  (TO: TJ; DA/rt 7.10.64) ( Blocks 4-6 Residual AE).
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Duva):
A.  The sections show skin to subcutis.  No breast ductolobular units are identified.  Within the deep dermis and subcutis is a 12mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  The carcinoma is composed of malignant cells with grade 3 nuclei arranged in solid nests and tubules (tubule score =  2), 55 mitoses per 10 (mitotic score = 3)(total score =8).  There is associated stromal desmoplasia and admixed chronic inflammation.  No distinct overlying dermal subcutaneous scar tissue is seen.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  
Margins:
The margins are as follows:  
Deep:  0.6mm (A4).
Superficial:  1.6mm (A4).
Medial:  3mm (A2).  
Superior:  6mm (A4).
Inferior and lateral:  Well clear (>10mm).  
Immunohistochemistry: 
The tumour cells stain as follows: 
-  CK7:  Positive
-  ER:    Positive (100% of cell show predominantly strong intensity staining) 
-  PR:    Positive ( About 30-40% of cells show weak to moderate intensity staining)
-  HER:  Negative (1+)
-  P63:   Negative
-  CK20: Negative.
Tissue will be sent to THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL Hospital for HER2 SISH testing as per Dr Caro.
B.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue with a small amount of muscle at the new superior margin.  A single detached fragment of granulation tissue is present on the apparent cavity side.  No fibrin, organising fibrosis or fat necrosis is seen.  No breast ductolobular units are seen.  There is no evidence of atypical epithelial hyperplasia, in situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left chest wall skin (excision):
-  Recurrent 12mm, grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma , NST, ER Positive, PR positive, HER2 SISH to follow (see text for margins).
B.  "Left breast near superior border":  
-  Fibroadipose tissue; no breast ductolobular units seen.
-  No evidence of atypical epithelial hyperplasia, in-situ or invasive malignancy.
