CLINICAL:
/9/64 - excision recurrent L vulval cancer.  Now 2 raised areas along suture line. 
? recurrence, ? granulation tissue.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulva",consists of tan tissue 5 x 3 x 3mm. AE 1 block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva", consists of a 3 x 3 x 3mm biopsy. AE 1 block. (TO: NZ/ec  14.11.64)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr M Yaiva and Dr Derick ALBROUGH) 

A. Sections of the vulval biopsy show irregularly thickened squamous epithelium with mild parakeratosis.  A small area of ulceration is seen at one edge.  There is marked active chronic inflammation in the underlying stroma and some inflammatory cells extend into the epithelium.   The Ki67 immunoperoxidase stain shows labeling of the basal epithelial cells only. Occasional cells express P53 antigen along the basal epithelial layers.  No yeast or fungi are demonstrated by the PAS stain. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.  
 
B. Sections show benign but thickened and mildly parakeratotic squamous epithelium accompanied by a marked mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the stroma.  Numerous inflammatory cells are also present within the epithelium.  Palissading histiocytes are seen aroundan area of acute inflammation at the deep aspect of the biopsy.  There is no evidence of malignancy. No yeast or fungi are demonstrated by the PAS stain.
 

Diagnosis:

A. Anterior vulva:  Squamous hyperplasia, active chronic inflammation.
B. Posterior vulva: Benign squamous epithelium, marked active chronic inflammation.
