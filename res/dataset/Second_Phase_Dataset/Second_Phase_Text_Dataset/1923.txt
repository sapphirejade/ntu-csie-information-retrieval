HISTORY:  
Adenocarcinoma cervix. 
(1) Uterus, left ovary and tubes.
(2) Left pelvic nodes
(3) Right pelvic nodes
(4) Right tube.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "UTERUS AND LEFTOVARY AND TUBE". At 9 o'clock there is a pink nodule 12mm in diameters which does not appear to be a tumour. No other macroscopic lesion is seen except in the endocervix there is an area of haemorrhage 8mm in diameter. The endometrium and the fundus is 2mm in thickness and the myometrium is 15mm. 
(1 ovary; 2 fallopian tube; 3-6 9 o'clock LS; 7-18 serial TS through external cervical os/cervix and cuffs, each section bisected; 9-25 3 o'clock LS; 26 uterine isthmus; 27 uterine body; 28 uterine fundus). RS(M-28).
B. "LEFT LYMPH NODE". Five nodes.
(1&2 one node; 3 four nodes). RS (M-3).
C. "RIGHT LYMPH NODES". Four nodes.
(1&2 one node; 3 ?three nodes). RS (M-3).
D. "RIGHT TUBE, (FALLOPIAN TUBE)". A fallopian tube with a fimbrial end. The fallopian tube is 50x5-10mm. IT is unremarkable. 
(1&2 fimbrial end; 3 TS). RS (M-3/EK/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:    (Dr. L. Niesborella)
Sections of ovary show occasional cystic follicles. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable. 
Sections of cervix show focal suture granulomas and inflamed granulation tissue consistent with healing wound. There is a focus of endometriosis.  Within dilated blood vessels, organising fibrin thrombi are identified. Adjacent to the healing wound, there is a focus showing residual changes of well differentiated adenocarcinoma on a background of AIS.  Adenocarcinoma measures 9mm in length and has a thickness of4.5mm.  Most of the tumour is exophytic and shows villoglandular architecture.
Opposite edge of the cervical cannal within the isthmus, there is a focus showing features of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.Focally, glandular formation is also noted.  No definite keratinization although some tumour cells show eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Tumour has a length of 8mm.  Thickness 4mm.  Cervical  thickness is  8mm at this site.  There is focal lymphatic permeation.   
The endometrium shows secretory activity. There are focal changes of adenomyosis. 
B. No evidence of malignancy is seen in five nodes examined.
C. No evidence of malignancy is seen in four lymph nodes identified.
D. Sections show fallopian tube. There is lymphatic dilatation. No evidence ofmalignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. UTERUS AND LEFT OVARY ANDTUBE
- RESIDUAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF CERVIX WITH BACKGROUND AIS
-SEPARATE FOCUS OF SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA  
- LOCAL EXCISION MARGINS APPEAR CLEAR.
B. LEFT LYMPH NODE
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN FIVE NODES.
C. RIGHT LYMPH NODE
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN FOUR NODES.
D. RIGHT TUBE
- NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
