Hx ofliver cystadenoma that was ruptured resulted in peritoneal metastases.  ? PMP.  Peritonectomy + debulking + HIPEC.  
Liver cyst + liver segment.
Peritoneum.
Spleen.
Gallbladder.
Appendix.
Uterus + ovaries.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, UTERUS, DIAPHRAGM, LIVER TUMOUR".  
An appendix measuring 50mm in length with maximum diameter of 6mm.  Mesoappendix measures 60x15x8mm.  Serosal surface is mildly dull.  Cut surface of the appendix is unremarkable.
(1-5 TS of appendix from tip to base [1 TS tip, 5 TS base])
Spleen - Weighing 190g and measuring 120x90x50mm.  Capsular surface is unremarkable.  No intrasplenic lesion identified.  
(6 RS spleen).
Gallbladder - Gallbladder measuring 115x40x20mm. Serosal surface is dull.  No obvious tumour mass identified.  Cystic lymph node measuring 20x10x6mm, present.  Gallbladder is oedematous.  No stones present.  Mucosal surface shows cholesterolosis.  
(7 TS cystic duct margin, neck, cystic lymph node; 8 TS body; 9 LS fundus).
Uterus with cervix and adherent peritoneum.  Uterus with cervix measures 85x50x35mm.  Peritoneum on the rightside measures 190x140x20mm.  Peritoneum on the left side measures 180x40x30mm.  Right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with maximum diameter of 10mm, right ovary measures 30x20x15mm.  Left fallopian tube is somewhat disrupted and appears to measures 30mm in length with maximum diameter of 10mm, left ovary measures 30x20x20mm.  On cut surface endometrium measures 1mm, myometrium measures 20mm.  Endometrial cavity is unremarkable.  An intramural fibroid measuring 20mm in maximum extent identified.  Its cut surface is pale and firm with whorling appearances.  The cut surface of the right ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Cut surface of the left ovary and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.The serosal surface of the peritoneum is dull but no obvious tumour mass identified.
(10-12 full LS anterior uterus and cervix; 13-15 full LS of posterior uterus and cervix; 16 RS fibroid; 17 RS right ovary and fallopian tube;18 RS left ovary and fallopian tube; 19&20 RS of the peritoneum)
Multiple fragments of peritoneal disease measuring 200x180x50mm in aggregate.  Cut surface contains multiple cystic lesions filled with mucinous fluid.  No obvious liver tissue identified.
(21-26 RS of peritoneal disease; 27&28 RS of tumour ? with liver tissue)
A piece of omentum measuring 600x80x20mm.  
(29-33 RS of omentum with cystic lesion).  RS (M-33/QK/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. O. Catlow)
Sections show fragments of a multicystic tumour. The cysts are lined by mucinous epithelium with atypia in keeping with low grade dysplasia and the associated stroma is of moderate cellularity, with many areas showing features reminiscent of ovarian stroma.  Some of the tumour fragments are associated with, or within hepatic parenchyma, and there are scattered foci of suture granulomata.  In short, the appearances are consistent with clinical history of mucinous cystadenoma of the liver, previously excised.  
In other sampled tumour fragments, there is no associated hepatic parenchyma, or evidence of involvement of other tissue or organs by the tumour.  In other words, there are no definite features to suggest spread of mucin producing epithelium beyond the liver.  Sections of other organs (appendix, spleen and ovaries) show organising surface mucin without epithelium.  
Representative sections of the appendixalso show mild periappendicitis. The appendiceal mucosa is unremarkable.  Sections of the splenic parenchyma are unremarkable.  Sections of the gallbladder show features of mild chronic cholecystitis together with cholesterolosis.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. The endometrium is inactive.  Sections of bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show benign serous inclusion cysts, and sections of bilateral fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  Sections of the omentum are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:  
LIVER TUMOUR, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, UTERUS -
-FRAGMENTS OF MUCINOUS CYSTADENOMA OF THE LIVER.
-DEPOSITS OF ORGANISING MUCIN ADHERENT TO SPLEEN, APPENDIX AND OVARIES, WITHOUT MUCINOUS EPITHELIUM.
-APPENDIX - MILD PERIAPPENDICITIS.
-SPLEEN - UNREMARKABLE PARENCHYMA.
-GALLBLADDER - MILD CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS, CHOLESTEROLOSIS.
-UTERUS - UNREMARKABLE CERVIX AND INACTIVE ENDOMETRIUM. SEROUS INCLUSION CYST OF THE OVARIES AND UNREMARKABLE FALLOPIAN TUBES.
-OMENTUM - WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.
