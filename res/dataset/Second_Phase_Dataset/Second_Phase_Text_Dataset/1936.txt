Ovarian mass.  CA125=386.  
1. Peritoneal washings for cytol.
2. Appendix epiploicae.
3. Right ovary and tube for frozen section.
Stage III B ca ovary.
1. Left sigmoid mesentery, 2. Right pelvic node, 3. Right uterine artery node, 4. Uterus, left ovary and tube, pouch of Douglas, Peritoneum, 5. Omentum, suture at nodule.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "APPENDIX EPIPLOICA". A piece of fatty tissue 10mm in diameter containing a 1mm white nodule.  RS (1-1)
F/S : "Poorlydiff large cell malignancy. Favour poorly diff. Adenoca".  Reported by Dr. A. Lawall on 25.11.64.
B.  "RIGHT OVARY + TUBE".  A partially incised solid ovary 95x60x45mm and fallopian tube 55mm long weighing 125g total.  The cutsurface of the ovary shows yellow solid tumour with areas of necrosis. The mid portion of the tube also shows a tumour nodule 30mm long.  
F/S : "Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ? serous with extensive necrosis".  Reportedby Dr. A. Rasulo to anaesthetist at 4.45 on 23.9.14.
(1 ovary FS; 2 tubal lesion FS; 3&4 LS fimbrial end oftube; 5-12 further sections of ovary; 13 peritoneum with ? nodule and TS fallopian tube; 13 further TS tube and nodule on attached peritoneal surface).  RS (M-13)
C.  "UTERUS, LEFT OVARY AND TUBE, POUCH OF DOUGLAS PERITONEUM".A uterus with attached left ovary and tube and Pouch of Douglas. The attached cervix, left ovary and tube and Pouch of Douglas.  The uterus measures up to 55mm from medial to lateral, 75mm from fundus to cervix, and 30mm from anterior toposterior.  The cervix measures 35mm in maximal diameter.  The left ovary measures up to 30x15x10mm and has a disrupted protruding cyst measuring 15mm in maximal extent. The left fallopian tube measures up to 60mm in length and 8mm inmaximal external diameter. The Pouch of Douglas peritoneum measures up to 60x50x5mm.  The serosal surface of the uterus has multiple firm nodules ? tumour ? fibroid.  On sectioning the uterus, the endometrium measures up to 3mm and the myometrium measures up to 18mm.  On sectioning the uterus, there are no further lesions identified.  
(1 representative TS ovary; 2 TS and LS fallopian tube with fimbrial end; 3 remaining fimbrial end; 4 Pouch of Douglas peritoneal nodule; 5-7 anterior cervix to fundus; 8-11 posterior cervix to fundus; 12 uterine serosal surface nodule; 13 ? fibroid at fundus).  RS (M-13)
 
D.  "OMENTUM - SUTURE AT NODULE".  A portion of omentum measuring up to 240x130x20mm.  There is a suture indicating a pale nodule measuring 10mm in maximal extent.  
(1 nodule transversely sectioned).  RS (M-1)
E.  "RIGHT PELVIC NODES".  An irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 25mm in maximal extent.  Two possible 2mm diameter nodes identified.
(1 possible node; 2 remaining tissue).  AE (M-2)
F.  "RIGHT UTERINE ARTERY NODE". A pale firm node 10mm in maximal extent.  AE (1-1)
G.  "LEFT SIGMOID MESENTERY".  Multiple pieces of fat, measuring in aggregate 20x20x15mm.  The largest piece has an irregular ? node measuring 18mm in maximal extent.
(1 node sectioned; 2 remaining tissue).  AE (M-2/LW/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (A. Schaetzle)

A.  Appendix Epiploicae : Deposit of high grade serous carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion.
B.  RIGHT OVARY:	Involved
Histological type and proportions:	High grade serous carcinoma
Histological grade:		G3
Nuclear grade:		G3
