CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the left ovary whilst 20weeks pregnant in 2063.  Completion surgery.  Pelvic mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a tube with attached ovary, the tube measures 105mm in length and 7mm in diameter and the ovary measures 40 x 30 x 25mm.  The ovary has a solid and patchy cystic cut surfaces.  Two transverse sections for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - frozen section; 3 to 8 - sections of the ovary; 9 - fimbrial end; 10 - representative section of fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative for tumour.

B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighs 99g.  The uterus measures 95 x 65 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 3mm and the myometrium is 23mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains foci of adenomyosis.  No definite invasive lesion is identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - longitudinal full face of body and cervix on anterior side; 5 to 8 - representative sections of body and fundus on the anterior side; 9 to 12 - longitudinal full face of the posterior body and cervix; 13 - 17 - representative of fundus and body on the posteriorside.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal scar", consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin measures 80 x 10 x 4mm.  On the skin surface a linear scar is present measures 55mm in maximum diameter.  The surgical margin is inked blue and specimen is serially transversally sectioned.  
Blocks: 1 - eight transverse sections; 2 - transverse sections of two ends.
D.  Specimen labelled "Hernia sac", consists of five pieces of unorientated fibrofatty tissue ranging from 20 x 55mm.  The larger piece is serially sectioned and the cut surface shows fibrofatty parenchyma no definite focal lesion is identified macroscopically.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - representative sections of the fibrofatty tissue.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Post uterine adhesions", consists of a piece of irregular shaped fibrofatty tissue measures 20 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left IP ligament", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measures 35 x 15 x 10mm.  Specimen serially transversally transversely sectioned.  The cut surface shows fibrofatty parenchyma.  No focal lesion is present.  The entire specimen embedded in2 blocks.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right proximal IP ligament", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measures 20 x 15 x 15mm.  There is a suture at one end .The cut section shows a large dilated vessel with attached blood clot.  No focal lesion is present.  
Blocks: 1 - sections of the suture end; 2 and 3 - the rest of the specimen.  AE.
H.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic peritoneum", consists of a piece of irregular shaped fibrous tissue measures 50 x 40 x 7mm.  Both surfaces are smooth.  No focal lesion is present.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. B Osenkowski):
A.  Sections of the ovary show numerous cystic follicles.  The tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show nosignificant abnormality.  The endometrium is proliferative.  The myometrium shows adenomyosis.  The uterine serosa shows adhesions.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show scar tissue in the dermis and subcutis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D, E, F, G & H.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to H.  No evidence of malignancy.
