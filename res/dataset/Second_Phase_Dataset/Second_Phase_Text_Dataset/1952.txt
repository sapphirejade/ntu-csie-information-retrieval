HISTORY:  
Colorectal cancer.  Peritonectomy.  Rectosigmoid resection.  Splenectomy.  Cholecystectomy.  Seminal vesicle excision right.  Wound.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"UMBILICUS, RECTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM"
Spleen:  Specimen weighs 230g and is 140x70x45mm.  The external surface is smooth and shiny, there is a small amount of hilar fat with no tumour present.  The cutsections reveal beefy red texture.  
(1&2 hilar area of spleen; 
Gallbladder:  The gallbladder is 70x40mm.  No staple is present over the cystic duct.  There is hard nodule 20mm in diameter on the serosal surfacewhich does no involve the mucosal surface.  The serosal surface of the gallbladder is smooth and shiny, the wall is 3mm and the mucosal is green and granular. 
3 cystic duct margin and ?lymph node; 4 further sections of cystic duct; 5 nodule; 6 body and fundus;
Rectum with mass:  A piece of bowel 110x35mm.  The distal end appears to be rectal.  Attached to the colon is tattered fatty tissue which has solid areas apparently involved by tumour.  This tissue is approximately 130x50x10mm.  At the distal end of the specimen there is a solid mucinous tumour 40mm which does no appear to involve the mucosa and appears to be outside of the muscularis propria.  
7 proximal resection margin; 8 distal resection margin with relationship with tumour; 9&10 sections of tumour at distal end of rectum showing relationship with muscularis propria and resection margin inked blue; 11 left lateral tissue with serosal surface; 12 firm fatty tissue lateral to bowel; 
Separate piece of bowel130x25mm:  In the adjacent fatty tissue there are numerous firm white nodules.  The bowel wall is 5mm and the mucosa appears unremarkable.  
13 resection margins; 14&15 samples of nodules;
?Omentum:  The ?omentum is approximately 450x60x10-20mm.  A number of large solid white nodules are present in the specimen.  
16&17 sample of two peritoneal nodules;
There are also numerous strips of peritoneum and smaller pieces of fatty tissue in the pot.  Tumour nodules are present in some of these pieces of tissue.  
18 section of loose piece of fatty tissue; 19&20 sections of?peritoneum with multiple -----------------
?Seminal vesicle:  Seminal vesical is not clearly identified.
21-24 ?seminal vesicle, with 21 also containing peritoneum..
Umbilicus:  There is a piece of skin 15x10x10mm
25 ?umbilicus).  RS (M-25/HX/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (R. Turzak)
Sections show multiple peritoneal and serosal deposit of metastatic, moderately to poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with high grade nuclear features, and areas of signet ring cell morphology. Thetumour cells show frequent mitotic activity and focally show intraluminal necrosis. There are multiple foci of invasion with a desmoplastic stromal response. Deposits of adenocarcinoma are present on the splenic capsule surface at the hilum of spleen, over the serosa of the gallbladder, the serosa of rectum, and in the tissue lateral to the rectum. There are also multiple nodules of adenocarcinoma involving the separate fragments of peritoneum and omentum, including involvement of the peritoneal surface.
 The proximal and distal rectal resection margins are not involved, with the distal margin being clear by at least 13mm. Sections of rectum show no mucosal tumour and no evidence of a primary tumour within the rectum. The left lateral tissue includes a cross section of vas, which is not involved. A section of umbilicus shows no involvement. Also present is a large lymph node, which is involved by micrometastases. All of the tumourexamined histologically appears to be metastatic, and the primary site of tumour is not identified in this material. Clinical correlation is required. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
UMBILICUS, RECTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM:  
 - MULTIPLE DEPOSITS OF METASTATIC, MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS. DEPOSITS OFCARCINOMA INVOLVE THE PERITONEUM AND SEROSAL SURFACES OF SPLEEN, RECTUM, GALLBLADDER AND OMENTUM, AND MICROMETASTASES ARE SEEN WITHIN A SINGLE LARGE LYMPH NODE. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS FOR MSI PROTEINS ARE IN PROGRESS, WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT TO FOLLOW.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Immunostains for MSI proteins (Caremark Rx ALICE SPRINGS HOSPITAL Lab; block: 9)
MLH1:  Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei
PMS2:  Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei
MSH2:  Positive (normal) staining of tumour cell nuclei
MSH6:  Positive (normal) staining oftumour cell nuclei
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
