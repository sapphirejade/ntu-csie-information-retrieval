SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (20.5.65):

CLINICAL:
Ca 125 340.  HE4 557.  Right complex adnexal mass with metastatic deposits adjacent to bladder and within spleen seen on pre-operative CT scan.  COPD.  OA.  Left knee replacement.  TAH/BSO / omentectomy / splenectomy.  Frozen section - poorly differentiated likely gynae origin.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a solid/cystic mass 90 x 70 x 60mm.  The fallopian tube is not definitely identified.  Approximately 30% of the external surfaceis covered by papillary excrescences and the remainder is smooth.  Approximately 2/3 of the mass is solid and fleshy.  A cystic component with thin serous fluid is also present.  Representative for FS in 3 blocks; 1 - tumour with surface excrescences; 2 - tumour with cystic area; 3 - tumour; 4 - ? fallopian tube; 5 - ? fallopian tube (clip on the surface); 6 & 7 - representative sections with surface excrescences; 8 - representative, reserve block; 9 - representative; 10 & 11- representative including cystic component. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Poorly differentiated carcinoma with psammomatous calcification, favour Mullerian primary.  Result to Dr Trent by DrsM Castilo/M Alcivar at 14:30 on 9.3.15. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary 42g in total. The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 35mm.  There is a nodular roughened area over the serosal surface 10 x 8 x 5mm. The ectocervix measures 32 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a polypoid mass within endometrium 12 x 11 x 11mm.  The remainder of the endometrium is less than 1mm in thickness.  On sectioning the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids 14 and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 20 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is distorted and its entire length cannot be readily identified. The fimbrial end appears to be present.  
Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (3 - includes part of the endometrial polyp); 4-6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (6 - contains part of the endometrial polyp); 7 - remainder of the endometrial polyp; 8 - section of uterus including the serosal nodule; 9 - section of fibroid; 10-12 - the entire left ovary; 13 & 14 - ? left fallopian tube. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of omental fatty tissue 410 x 140 x 15mm.  Thereare three pale solid nodules ranging from 10 to 45mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks 1 & 2 - representative.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Spleen", consists of a spleen 120 x 75 x 50mm weighing 195g.  The specimen has been incised prior to receipt.  Within the spleen there is a solid nodule with pale cut surfaces 60 x 55 x 45mm.  The nodule isnecrotic centrally.  There are multiple smaller nodules within the splenic hilar fat and on the surface of the spleen ranging from 8 to 15mm in maximum dimension.  Block 1- tumour interface with spleen; 2 - section including necrotic area; 3 - section of a smaller nodule. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists of a vermiform appendix 45mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter with attached fatty tissue 40 x 10 x 5mm.  The serosalsurface is smooth and glistening.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  Block 1 - distal half bisected; 2 - proximal half bisected.All of the appendix is blocked.
F.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas nodules", consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue and solid nodules 35 x 32x 7mm in aggregate.  The nodes have pale solid cut surfaces.  Block 1- representative.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Retrocaecal mass", consists of a solid masswith attached fatty tissue 35 x 14 x 10mm.  The solid mass measures 20 x 9 x 9mm.  The mass has pale cut surfaces.  Block 1- representative.  (TO: RC/ec 12.5.65) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr M Srey & Dr M Messman) 
A.  Sections of the right ovary show a high grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma is arranged in sheets, papillae and acini.  The malignant cells have markedly pleomorphic nuclei and mitoses are frequent.  There is extensive geographic necrosis within the tumour.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  Tumour involves the serosal surface of the ovary.  The fallopian tube is not identified. 
B.  Sections of the cervix include the transformation zone and show no significant abnormality.  There is a benign endometrial polyp.  Benign leiomyomas are confirmed. There are deposits of high grade serous carcinoma at the serosal surface of the uterus.  Sections of left ovary show partial involvement by high grade serous carcinoma.  The left fallopian tube shows no evidence of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma or invasive carcinoma.
C.  Sections of omentum show metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections of spleen show metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
E.  Sections of appendix show fibrous obliteration of the lumen. There is no evidence ofmalignancy.
F.  Sections show metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
G.  Sections show metastatichigh grade serous carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right tube and ovary:  High grade serous carcinoma.
B.  Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary:
1.  High grade serous carcinoma involving left ovary and uterine serosa.
2.  Benign endometrial polyp and leiomyomas.
C.  Omentum:  Metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
D.  Spleen: Metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
E.  Appendix:  No significant abnormality.
F. Pouch of Douglas nodules:  Metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
G.  Retrocaecal mass:  Metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (20.5.65):
A.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
