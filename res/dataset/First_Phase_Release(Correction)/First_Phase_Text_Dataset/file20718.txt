MACROSCOPIC:
A.  OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, PANCREAS, STOMACH&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple components.  First part is a gallbladder 120mm in length, 35mm in diameter received intact, unopened. The cystic duct opening is 5mm. The serosa is smooth and shiny.  A possible cystic node is seen at the neck 5mm.  On opening the lining appears dark green, velvety. Wall thickness up to 3mm. The gallbladder contained dark green bile.  No gallstones identified.

(1 cystic duct opening and cystic node; 2 neck and body; 3 fundus)

Part two of the specimen consists of a distal pancreas with attached fat weighing 65g. The pancreas measures 100x30x25mm. At the tail is attached fatty tissue 55x25x10mm.  Part of the pancreas is covered in a smooth peritonealised surface.  This will be inked blue, the opposite surface appears rough, this will be inked black and the proximal margin inked red. The pancreas is sliced from proximal margin to the tail into 20 slices. Cut surface an unremarkable appearing fatty pancreas with multiple involved peripancreatic lymph nodes.  Largest is a metastatic deposit 12mm which is situated in a lymph node 20mm in slice 2.

Next part of the specimen consists of a subtotal gastrectomy with attached omentum with the following components, distal stomach measuring 220mm in length, 70mm in diameter with attached duodenum 20mm. Fat attached to lesser curvature 60x45x20mm. Fat including omentum attached to greater curvature 300x200x20mm. Also present attached to the lesser curvature is a length of pancreas measuring 40x20x20mm. The specimen is inked anterior blue, posterior black. The stomach is sliced into multiple transverse slices as indicated on the diagram.  Cut surface shows infiltrative pale cream tumour situated within the pylorus measuring 45x45x40mm.  The tumour appears to extend to the serosal surface and into the lesser curvature fat with possible involvement of adjacent pancreas. The tumour is macroscopically 20mm away from the distal duodenal margin, 30mm away from the proximal margin. The remaining mucosa is tan and shows normal rugae.

E.  &amp;quot;ABDOMINAL WALL WOUND&amp;quot;. Consists of an unoriented ellipse of skin 35x18mm to a depth of 40mm. The skin surface shows a possible scar 15mm in length. There is partial distortion ? related to instrumentation but otherwise is unremarkable in appearance.  Multiple transverse slices made cut surface shows fibrous tissue which extends to the deep, roughly 20x10x15mm.

(1 shaved pole; 2 one TS; 3&amp;amp;4 one TS; 5 one TS). RS (M-5)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr O Hard)
A.  Histology shows a poorly differentiated intestinal type adenocarcinoma which infiltrates through the full thickness of the wall of the stomach to reach the serosal surface and invades the local adjacent pancreatic bed where there is widespread perineural infiltration by carcinoma. There is a large ductal structure adjacent to the pancreatic bed ? bile duct which is infiltrated and partially stenosed by tumour in the wall. There is lymphovascular invasion and perineural infiltration within the bed of pancreas with metastatic deposits in 15 out of 22 nodes (3 out of 8 peripancreatic, and 12 out of 14 lesser and greater curve/gastric nodes).  Within the peripancreatic nodes which are involved close to the distal gastric resection margin, there is extranodal extension with tumour focally extending to a local soft tissue margin (block 28).  The proximal and gastric wall resection margins themselves are not involved by malignancy.  Small serosal metastatic deposits of carcinoma are also seen.  A focus of vascular invasion is also present within perigastric fat.  The cystic duct lymph node is not invloved and the gall bladder shows minor chronic inflammation

B.  Histology shows scattered groups of isolated tumour cells in one lymph node.

C.  Histology shows a metastatic deposit of adenocarcinoma within one of three lymph nodes. There is no extranodal extension.

D.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in two lymph nodes.

E.  Histology shows skin with underlying fat and soft tissue which contains an area of maturing fibrous scar tissue and granulation tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

F.  Histology shows a micrometastatic deposit of adenocarcinoma in one of three lymph nodes (1mm in diameter).

G.  Histology shows fatty peritoneal tissue containing multiple small deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
