SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (15.4.2067)

CLINICAL:
Anterior resection and distal donut.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Low anterior resection&amp;quot; consists of a segment of large bowel and rectum 220mm in length with a circumference of 70mm.  There is attached mesocolon up to 130mm in width.  The non-peritonealised mesocolon margin is inked blue.  The distal stapled surgical margin is at the level of the anterior peritoneal reflection.  Within the rectum there is a circumferential, centrally ulcerated tumour measuring 50mm in length.  The tumour is 26mm from the distal margin and 150mm from the proximal margin.  The tumour infiltratesthe bowel wall and pericolic tissue to a depth up to 20mm posteriorly.  The tumour is 6mm from the non-peritonealised posterior mesocolon margin.  The tumour focally abuts the anterior peritoneal surface.  Occasional diverticula are seen.
Blocks:  1 - LS proximal margin; 2 - LS distal margin; 3 - LSrepresentative bowel; 4 &amp;amp; 5 - representative tumour; 6 - tumour closest to anterior peritoneal surface; 7 - tumour closest to posterior non-peritonealised surface ; 8 - tumour with adjacent mucosa (MSI block); 9 - diverticulum; 10 - apical lymph node; 11 to 14 - multiple lymph nodes; 15 &amp;#8211; single lymph node, bisected; 16 &amp;#8211; multiple lymph nodes; 17 &amp;#8211; representative pericolic adipose tissue.   (TO: JB; JB/ta 15/1/65)
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Donut&amp;quot; consists of a donut measuring 17mm in diameter and 6mm in length.  AE 1 block.   (TO: JB:  JB/mm 13.1.65)

Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  6mm
Lymph nodes

Number of lymph nodes involved:	Nil (0).
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Not identified.
Perineural invasion
Not identified.
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Diverticular disease is confirmed.  The distal donut (specimen B) shows no significant abnormality.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Not applicable.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (15.4.2067) - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY REPORT:
Reported by A/Prof Sacre A Cooper, HENTY MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Hospital
MATERIAL PROVIDED: The H&amp;amp;E section shows tumour involving a total area of approximately 20xl0mm.  On the whole section tumour represents approximately 70% of the section.  Tissue scrolls were used for the analysis.  No macro-dissection was performed.
Please note that the purpose of this assessment is purely to determine if lesional material is present and adequate for molecular testing and does not constitute a formal pathology review.
RESULTS:  NRAS G12D/E MUTATION IDENTIFIED.
Gene			NRAS
Location in Gene	exon 2
THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION:  Tumours harbouring mutations in KRAS or NRAS exons 2, 3 or 4 predict lack of response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy (Douillard et al NEJM 2013; 369:1023-34; Allegra CJ et al. J Chin Oncol 2015; Oct 5).
TEST DESCRIPTION:
This test profiles a broad range of somatic mutations from 5 common oncogenes (BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, KIT and NRAS) using OncoFOCUS with additional custom panel.  This multi-gene parallel profiling is intended to assist the selection of targeted therapies for cancer patients.  Mutation analysis is performed on DNA isolated from tumour tissue.  The relevant target regions are amplified in 2 multiplex PCR reactions followed by 12 multiplex extensions.  Any mutant allele is accurately identified by mass spectrometry.  Any reported mutation is called with high confidence (i.e. the proportion of a mutant allele is 10% or more).  This oncogene panel can detect over 300 mutations including the following clinically relevant mutations in the EGFR (NM_ 005228), KRAS (NM_004985), BRAF (NM_004333), KIT (NM_000222) and NRAS (NM_002524) genes.

COMMENT:
&amp;#8226;	Samples can contain a variable proportion of tumour cells to normal cells and there may also be tumour cell heterogeneity.  If tumour cells represent less than 20% of the cells analysed the sensitivity of the assay may be reduced.
&amp;#8226;	All PCR based molecular diagnostic tests are subject to a low risk of non-amplification of one allele due to primer binding site DNA variants.  This can also lead to a false negative result.
&amp;#8226;	The laboratory assumes an appropriate form of consent has been obtained.
&amp;#8226;	This report should not be copied or reproduced, except in its entirety.
