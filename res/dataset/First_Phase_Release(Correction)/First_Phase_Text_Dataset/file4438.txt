***AMENDED REPORT: Dr D Sylva (17.11.2070)

CLINICAL:
Hepatic flexure cancer.
Specimen sampled for tumour banking.


MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled: &amp;quot;Right hemicolectomy&amp;quot;.

Specimen
Specimen length: 190mm
Length of terminal ileum: 20mm
Length of caecum/ascending colon: 165mm
Thickness of mesocolon: up to 80mm
Appendix: 65mm in length and a diameter of 5mm. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.

Tumour
Location:  Ascending colon/distal aspect of the specimen.
Description: A coin-like lesion with raised edges and ulcerated centre. Tumour Invades into muscularis propria.
Maximum tumour diameter: 40mm, occupying 80% of the circumference of the colon
Perforation:  Absent
Appearance of serosa overlying tumour: Obscured by mesocolic fat.
Distance of tumour to proximal cut end: 110mm.
Distance of tumour to distal cut end: 25mm.
Distance of tumour to circumferential margin:  Well clear.

Other
Polyps: A polyp of 9mm is identified proximal to the tumour, 20mm away.
Adherent structures: Not applicable.
Other: Not applicable.
Inked margins: Proximal blue, distal black.

Blocks: 1 - LS of proximal margin; 2- LS of distal margin; 3 - LS of ileocaecal valve; 4 &amp;amp; 5 - appendix; 6-8 - full face of tumour with adjacent normal; 9 &amp;amp; 11- second full face of tumour with deepest invasion; 12 - tumour with deepest invasion; 13 - polyp; 14 - shave of apical region; 15 - one lymph node; 16 - one lymph node; 17-22 - lymph nodes as seen; 23-25 - RS of mesocolic fat.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Bey)
The hepatic flexure tumour is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for colorectal adenocarcinoma follows:

SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
T3    Beyond muscularis propria

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:   Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  Twenty-three
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0 of 23

Lymphovascular invasion
Present (intramural)
Extramural venous invasion is present focally (Block 10).

Perineural invasion
Absent

Tumour budding
Bd1 (low):   0 - 4 buds per 0.785 sq mm

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX    Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the tip. The separate polyp identified macroscopically is a tubulovillous adenoma (low grade).

Residual tumour status
R0    No residual tumour

Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Not applicable

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1    Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2    Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2    Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6    Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:  Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry
Not performed

Reserve block for molecular studies:  12
Reserve block for tumour banking:  8

Summary - AJCC 8th Edition
Adenocarcinoma NOS
T3       MX    R0


DIAGNOSIS:
Right hemicolectomy: 40mm moderately differentiated (pT3) adenocarcinoma, LVSI, clear of margins; no evidence of malignancy in twenty-three lymph nodes (0/23).


***AMENDED REPORT: Dr D Trouser (17.11.2070)
The case was reviewed for presentation at the clinical MDT meeting.
In deeper levels, a focus of extramural venous invasion was identified (block 10).


DIAGNOSIS:
Focal extramural venous invasion is present (the above synoptic has been amended in underline/bold).
