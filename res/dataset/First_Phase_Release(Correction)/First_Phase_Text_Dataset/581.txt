Distribution:   FILE-COPY

CLINICAL:
Interval debulking for serous pelvic cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy 4 cycles preop.  Ovarian Ca.  Small bowel nodule.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovary + tube" consists of an ovary measuring 20x 10 x 7mm with attached fallopian tube measuring 30mm in length and 5mm in external diameter and a small amount of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 5mm.  The surface of the ovary is smooth and shiny.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  Representative sections in seven blocks.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - ovary AE; 6 - fallopian tube fimbrial end; 7 - fallopian tube representative body; 8 remaining fallopian tube AE.  (TO: WJ; EH/mm 12.3.62) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of an ovary measuring 20 x 13 x 6mm with attached fallopian tube measuring 25mm in length and 5mm in external diameter and a small amount of attached fatty tissue measuring 20 x 20 x 5mm.  The surface of the ovary is smooth and shiny and its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  Representative sections in seven blocks.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - ovary AE; 6 - fallopian tube fimbrial end; 7 - representative fallopian tube body; 8 - remaining fallopian tube AE.  (TO: XA; FH/mm 12.3.62) 
C.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel nodule" consists of an irregular piece of cream tissue fragment measuring 5mm across.  AE one block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of an elongated and flattened piece of omental fat measuring 420 x 80 x 8mm.  The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue.  No obvious focal mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections in eight blocks.   (WI/cc  12/2/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Tuman): 
A.  The entire ovary and fallopian tube have beenembedded.
Sections of the ovary and fallopian tube show minute surface foci of psammoma body deposition, associated with sclerosis, elastosis and haemosiderin laden macrophages. There is no evidence of residual malignancy.
B. The entire ovary and fallopian tube have been embedded.
Sections of the ovary show surface foci of sclerosis, associated with psammoma bodies, and mild chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of residual of malignancy.
The fallopian tube shows no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
C. Sections show peritoneum with scattered psammoma bodies and sclerosis in the underlying connective tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D. The omentum has extensively sampled. 
Sections show omental fat with occasional psammoma bodies and foci of sclerosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.
COMMENT:
The previous core biopsy (64V8451) has been reviewed. The diagnosis of serous adenocarcinoma in this biopsy is confirmed.
Shown to Dr LACY BEHLEN and Dr OMER KRUSCHKE.
DIAGNOSIS:
A and B. Bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes: surface foci of sclerosis with psammoma bodies, no evidence of malignancy
C. Small bowel nodule: sclerosis with psammoma bodies, no evidence of malignancy
D. Omentum: foci of sclerosis with psammoma bodies, no evidence of malignancy
