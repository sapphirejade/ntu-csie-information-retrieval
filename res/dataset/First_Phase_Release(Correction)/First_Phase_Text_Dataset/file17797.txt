Block Legend:  (1) 1TS proximal, 1TS middle, 1LS - fallopian tube (2) TS ovary. -/2 NAE.

B) UTERINE CURETTINGS - a moderate amount of blood clot and brown tissue, 30x30mm in aggregate. -/3 AE. FK/dc 2/2/66

MICROSCOPIC:

A) The fallopian tube is unremarkable. The ovary shows atrophic changes and contains scattered corpus albicans. There are no features of malignancy or tubal intraepithelial dysplasia.

B) The curettings shows back to back and partly irregular malignant endometrial gland proliferation. The glands show high N:C ratio, elongated to round nuclei, hyperchromatic and partly uneven chromatin pattern and conspicuos mitoses. The appearances are in keeping with a well differentiated  endometrioid adenocarcinoma,  FIGO Grade 1, in this sample.
