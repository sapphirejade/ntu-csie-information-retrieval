MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Simko):
Sections show a mature cystic teratoma.  Much of the lining epithelium is replaced by a florid granulomatous, giant cell and xanthomatous reaction to hair shafts and keratin, however, there is residual stratified squamous epithelium with appendages as well as  cartilage, respiratory type epithelium, brain tissue, non- descript cuboidal epithelium.  There is focal reactive/ regenerative atypia of residual squamoid type epithelium.  Focally there is an apparent separate cyst which shows features raising the possibility of an endometriotic cyst.   There is no evidence of immaturity or malignancy.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
A &amp;amp; B.
-  Mature cystic teratoma.
-  Possible endometriotic cyst.
