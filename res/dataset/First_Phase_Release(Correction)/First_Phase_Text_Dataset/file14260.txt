MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;#160;Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Fundal biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of a 2mm biopsy.  AE 1 block.
&amp;#160;
B. &amp;#160;Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Antral biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of a 2mm biopsy.  AE 1 block.
&amp;#160;
C. &amp;#160;Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Ascending biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of three biopsies measuring 1 to 2mm.  AE 1 block.
&amp;#160;
D. &amp;#160;Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Hepatic flexure polyp&amp;#8221; consists of three biopsies measuring 1 to 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: JB; JB/ua 7.11.66)


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Carty)
A.  Sections show gastric acid secreting mucosa with a patchy mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate within the lamina propria. No Helicobacter organisms are seen. There is no evidence of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy.
B.  Sections show gastric junctional mucosa with a patchy mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate within the lamina propria. No Helicobacter organisms are seen. There is no evidence of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy.
C.  Levels of the ascending colon biopsy show superficial fragments of villous adenoma. There is minimal lamina propria for assessment. There is no evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy.
D.  The hepatic flexure polyp is a tubulovillous adenoma. There is no evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Gastric fundal biopsy: Patchy mild non-specific chronic gastritis.

B.  Gastric antral (junctional) biopsy: Mild non-specific chronic inflammation.

C.  Ascending colon biopsy: Superficial fragments of villous adenoma.

D.  Hepatic flexure polyp: Tubulovillous adenoma.
