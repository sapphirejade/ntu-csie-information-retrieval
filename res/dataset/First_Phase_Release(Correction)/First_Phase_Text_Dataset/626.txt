CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 87.5g.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium appears roughened and irregular over an area of 20 x 18mm anteriorly and 20 x 20mm posteriorly.  The cutsurface shows cream tumour 18mm deep infiltrating myometrium with maximal thickness of 21mm.  The myometrium contains a single 12mm fibroid.  The right ovary measures 20 x 8 x 8mm and has a smooth outer surface.  Its cut surface showsa pale nodule measuring 5mm across.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length 6mm in external diameter.  There are several parafimbrial cysts measuring up to 6mm across.  The left ovary measures 18 x 8 x 5mm.  There is a firm white nodule on its surface measuring 5mm across.  Its cut surface appears grossly normal.  The left fallopian measures 50mm in length and up to 5mm in external diameter. There are also several parafimbrial fimbrial cysts measuring up to 5mm across.  Representative sections in 18 blocks.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 7 - anterior body representative sections; 8 to 10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - posterior body representative sections; 13 - right ovary BAE; 14 - right fallopian tube fimbrial end; 15 - right fallopian tube representative sections; 16 - left ovary divided into 5 and AE; 17 - left fallopian tube fimbrial end; 18 - left fallopian tube representative sections.   (PN/ta 12/5/62)  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Mcmurtrie): 
Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  Carcinoma has a maximum depth of invasion of 18mm through a wall 20mm thick.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  There is no evidence of lymphvascular invasion.  The ovaries have been examinedin their entirety and show no significant abnormality.  Simple paratubal cysts are seen in association with the right and left fallopian tubes. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium,maximum depth of invasion 18mm through a wall 20mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
