CLINICAL:
Removal pelvic mass. Right ovarian mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary", consists of a multicystic ovary 245 x 210 x 110mm with a tube 55mm in length.  Two defects are present on the surface, the larger 40 x 40mm.  On sectioning the surface appears mucinous and several more solid areas are present.  Two FS submitted.  
Block 1 - FS block 1, AE; 2 - FS block 2, AE; 3-6 - separately wrapped tissue, AE; 7-20 - solid area, AE; 21-25 - further representative ovarian mass; 26 - tumour reserve block; 27 - representative fallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION:  Borderline mucinous tumour.
Result to Dr Venzeio by Dr I Sturman at 14:15pm on 19.9.12.
B.  Specimenlabelled "Right IP plus right fallopian tube", consists of four pieces of haemorrhagic irregularly shaped, ? peritoneal tissue 55 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  A 55mm probable fallopian tube is present.  Representative 3 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left IP plus left fallopian tube", consists of a 20mm segment of fallopian tube attached to a 40 x 20 x 25mm piece of ragged peritoneal tissue.  No fimbrial tissue is identified.  Representative 3 blocks. 
D.   Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall nodule", consists of two firm nodules 5 and 6mm in maximum dimension attached to strips of peritoneum 90 and 30mm in length.  AE 1 block. 
E.   Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of omentum 370 x 180 x 25mm with unremarkable cut surfaces.  Representative 3 blocks.  (WB/ec  22.11.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Marusak) 
A.  Sections show a high grade borderline mucinous tumour with small foci of well differentiated adenocarcinoma (blocks 4, 21, 26).   The tumour is strongly and diffusely positive for CK7 and only very focally positive for CK20 and virtually negative for CDX2.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show an unremarkable fallopian tube.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show a paratubal cyst but no definite tube.  Thereis no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show a small benign serous cystadenoma of the ovary.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade borderline tumour of the right ovary with small foci of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. All other biopsies negative.
