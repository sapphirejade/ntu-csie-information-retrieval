CLINICAL:
ILC left breast - left mastectomy + sentinel node biopsy.  Short superior, long lateral = sutures.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left sentinel node axilla" consistsof two lymph nodes, 20 x 10 x 10mm and 25 x 10 x 10mm.  One of the lymph nodes has a pale central area ?deposit, 4mm in diameter.  Two smears done.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph node no 1; 3 & 4 - lymph node no 2.  
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
Negative for tumour.  
Phone result to Dr LIONEL-Longwith's assistant by Dr A Hollerman at 5pm on 17.12.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast, long lateral, short superior" consists of a breast with two sutures for orientation as above measuring 260mm (medial to lateral), 160mm (superior to inferior), 40mm (superficial to deep) with an ellipse of overlying skin with nipple and areolar complex, 180 x 75mm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The anterior margin is inked blue and the posterior margin is inked black.  On sectioning and behind the nipple there is a large gritty and pale tumour, measuring 50mm (medial to lateral) x 45mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (superficial to deep).  It is located 20mm from the closest deep margin and is more than 25mm from superficial margin.  The other margins are well clear.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrocystic appearance.
Blocks:  1 - nipple; 2 -closest deep margin; 3 to 12 - tumour (block 8 - reserved block); 13 - 16 - representative sections of four quadrants (13 - upper outer quadrant; 14 - upper inner quadrant; 15 - lower outer quadrant; 16 - lower inner quadrant).  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla level I" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue, 30 x 10 x 10mm and 15 x 10 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes ranging from 3mm to 15mm. 
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one lymph node each.  
(UA/mm 19.2.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Fabian):  
A.  Two (2) lymph nodes are identified.  Both lymph nodes show isolated tumour cells (<0.2mm), which are identified by immunohistochemical stain.  There is no evidence of extranodal spread.
B.  Sections show invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 50mm in diameter.  The carcinoma scores grade 2 (T-3, N-2, M-1).  There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  No DCIS component is seen.  There is extensive LCIS/ALH within the invasive carcinoma andwithin adjacent breast tissue.  The carcinoma is completely excised.  The invasive lobular carcinoma is 20mm to the deep margin and is well clear of the other margins.  The LCIS is 20mm to the deep margin and is well clear of the other margins.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for ER and PR.  The stain for HER-2 is negative.  The nipple is unremarkable.  The rest of breast shows benign fibrocystic change.
C.  Three (3) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
