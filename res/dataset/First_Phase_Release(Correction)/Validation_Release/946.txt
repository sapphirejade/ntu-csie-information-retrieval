D.  Specimen labelled "Uterus plus cervix in formalin" consists of a uterus, cervix and vaginal cuff without fallopian tubes or ovaries weighing 278g.  The uterus measures 60 x 55 x 45mm and has a smooth dull serosal surface.  The ectocervix is distorted by a large fungating tan browntumour.  On sectioning the tumour is seen to form a large polypoid mass involving the posterior cervical lip and also extending onto the anterior lip on the left side.  The polypoid mass measures 95 x 80 x 45mm.  There is a vaginal wallcuff which marks the true surgical margin (inked black); this appears narrow (around 5mm) on the left side laterally but elsewhere is well clear.  
The endometrium is 5mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 16mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - Full LS posterior body and cervix full LS, 5 to 6 - Full LS of anterior body and cervix; 7 to 12 - anterior vaginal wall and tumour; 13 - a reserve tumour block; 14 to 21 - left vaginal wall and tumour margin (15 & 16 - paired blocks; 17 & 18 - paired blocks closest tumour to vaginal wall margin; 19 & 20 - paired blocks); 21 - left lateral vaginal cuff margin.  See diagram.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right fallopian tube" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 55mm in length and 8mm in maximum diameter.  Representative in 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left fallopian tube" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 62mm in length x 8mm in maximum diameter.  Representative in 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of membranous fibrofattytissue measuring 80 x 40 x 3mm.  One surface is smooth and grey (peritoneum) the other surface is covered by fat.  Representative in 2 blocks.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece offibrofatty tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm.  On sectioning there are two lymph nodes measuring 10 and 12mm in maximal diameter.  AE 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node.
I.  Specimen labelled "Leftexternal iliac lymph node" consists of a ragged piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 45 x 20 x 5mm.  On sectioning four lymph nodes are identified ranging from 4mm to 6mm in maximal dimension. AE 4 blocks
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - two lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - rest of tissue.
J.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 65 x 42 x 8mm.  Six possible lymph nodesare identified measuring from 20mm to 5mm in maximal dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one lymph node; 5 - ?two lymph nodes.
K.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 70 x 35 x 10mm.  Three possible lymph nodes are identified measuring from 15 to 10mm.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node; 3 - ?lymph node.
L.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 100 x 40 x 10mm.  Four possible lymph nodes are identified measuring from 4mm to 10mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node; 3 - ?one lymph node; 4 - ?one lymph node.
M.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a lymph node measuring 18mm in maximum dimension covered in subcutaneous fat measuring 25 x 16 x 8mm.  Specimen AE 2 blocks.   (TO: PT; LE/bl 14/4/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Afan):
A.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
B.   Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
C.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
D.  Sections show a large, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix.  The tumour invades deeply into stroma of the posterior lip.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion ismeasured at 20mm where total stromal thickness is 23mm.  There is lymphovascular invasion including involvement of at least one small muscular vein.  Three left paracervical lymph nodes are identified in the sections and there is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in two of these nodes. There is extranodal spread from one of the involved nodes and lymphovascular invasion is also identified in left paracervical soft tissue (block D19).  
Some of the posterior vaginalcuff mucosa is denuded and changes of CIN 3/VAIN 3 extend towards a vaginal cuff margin where the surface epithelium is denuded (block D14).  The vaginal cuff excision margins are all well clear of invasive carcinoma (greater than 5mm).The closest deep cervical stromal margin is 2mm (block D22).
The remaining endocervical columnar epithelium is unremarkable.
Sections of the endometrium show that this is in proliferative phase and has features of chronic endometritis.  The myometrium is unremarkable.    
E, F.  Sections show unremarkable fallopian tubes.  
G.  Sections show mesothelium with underlying tissue.  No abnormality is seen.
H.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
I.Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
J.   Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
K.   Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
L.   Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 

M.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.

A.   Left paracervical mass:  Lymph node with no tumour (0/1).
B.   Left iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4). 
C.   Paracervical node:  No tumour (0/1). 
D.Uterus:  Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix with paracervical lymph node metastases (2/3). 
E.   Right fallopian tube:  No abnormality seen.
F.    Left fallopian tube:  No abnormality seen.

I.     Left external iliac lymph nodes.  No tumour (0/6).
J.    Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/6). 
K.   Left obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0.5). 
L.   Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4). 
M.  Right common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
