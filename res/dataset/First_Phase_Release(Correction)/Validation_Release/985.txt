Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Large ovarian mass.  Frozen section, mucinous borderline tumour.  Large left ovarian mass containing more than 5L of fluid.  Normal uterus, tube and right ovary.  Normal omentum and appendix.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of a large ovarian mass measuring 300 x 260 x 40mm and weighing 2.54kg.  The attached fallopian tubemeasures 100mm in length and 6mm in diameter.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The external surface of the ovary is smooth.  The cut surfaces show a multiloculated cyst containing thick fluid.  Focal solid areas are present (less than 10%).
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 - representatives the fallopian tube; 4 to 21 - representatives.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Borderline mucinous tumour.
Result to anaesthetist at 15:50pm by Dr Tad Clarson on the 19.5.2064.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, right tube + ovary" consists of uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and right ovary weighing 226g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 60 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 3mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 21mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium has foci of adenomyosis.  There is one fibroid 15mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6 to 9 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 10 - representative, fibroid; 11 to 13 - sections including the thickest endometrium; 14 - representative right ovary; 15 - representative right fallopian tube.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a flattened piece of omental tissue 170 x 80 x 4mm.  No nodules are identified.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.
D.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of a vermiform appendix 65mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is slightly congested.  The attached mesoappendiceal fatty tissue is up to 15mm across.  The lumen is filled with soft faecal material.  All of the vermiformappendix is blocked.
Blocks:  1 - the tip bisected; 2 - mid appendix; 3 - the base bisected.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Kapps):
A.  Sections show intestinal type glands of various sizes and shapes with stratification of the lining epithelium and multifocal mild cytological atypia.  There is no evidence of stromal invasion.  The features are of a mucinous borderline tumour.  No tumour is identified on the surface of the ovary.  Sections of the fallopian tube show no significant abnormality. 
Immunostains:
Cytokeratin 7:  Diffusely positive.
Cytokeratin 20:  Around 50% of tumour cells positive.
CDX2:  Generallypositive, variable intensity.
The immunophenotype is consistent with a primary mucinous borderline tumour of ovary.

B.  Sections of the cervix include the transformation zone and show no significant abnormality.  Sections of uterusshow simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. There are foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium.  A leiomyoma is also seen.  There are several small serous inclusion cysts in the right ovary.  Sections of the right fallopian tube show no significant abnormality.
C. Sections of omentum show some mild surface mesothelial proliferation but the appearances are otherwise unremarkable.  No tumour is seen.
D. The entire vermiform appendix has been blocked.  There is a small hyperplastic polyp but the appearances are otherwise unremarkable.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left tube and ovary:  Mucinous borderline tumour (intestinal type).
B.  Uterus, right tube and ovary:  Adenomyosis and uterine leiomyoma.
C.  Omental biopsy:  No significant abnormality.
D.  Appendix:  No significant abnormality.
