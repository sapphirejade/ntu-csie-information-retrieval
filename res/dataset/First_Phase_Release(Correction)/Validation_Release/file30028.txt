Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
PMB.  Complex mass R ovary.  Frozen section right ovary + tube.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries.  Peritoneal washings.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right ovary + tube&amp;#8221;, consists of a multicystic ovarian mass 74 x 59 x 60mm with a probable stretched tube 105mm long.  The cut surface shows a small broad oedematous papillae involving less than 10% of the inner surface of the ovarian mass.  The outer surface is smooth.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - Frozen section of the blocks; 3 to 12 - Ovarian mass representative sections; 13 - Fallopian tube; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - Possible fimbrial end.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus&amp;#8221;, consists of an uterus with attached cervix, weighing 46.3g in total. The uterus measures 65 x 42 x 32mm and has a haemorrhagic serosal surface posteriorly and on the right lateral aspect.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and is haemorrhagic over the anterior and posterior surfaces.  The endometrium is up to 1mm and the myometrium is up to 15mm in thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - Full longitudinal section through anterior body and cervix; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - Full longitudinal section through posterior body and cervix.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left ovary and tube&amp;#8221;, consists of a ovary measuring 13 x 8 x 8mm.  The cut surface is unremarkable.  The fallopian tube measures 37mm in length x 8mm in diameter.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - Ovary all embedded; 3 - Fallopian tube.  (TO:JL/eh 7/10/65)


FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
A.  Serous cystadenoma.
Result to Dr M Rainge by Dr M Dobbin at 18:14 on 6/07/2019.


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr M Burtell)
A.  Sections of the right ovarian cyst show a benign serous cystadenofibroma. There is focal epithelial stratification, however, this involves less than 5% of the epithelium and is insufficient for characterisation as borderline. The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive/weakly proliferative.  The myometrium shows no significant abnormality.  The serosa appears focally congested. There is no evidence of complex atypical hyperplasia or malignancy.

C.  Sections of the left ovary show a benign serous cyst. There are scattered aggregates of psammomatous calcifications. The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right ovary and fallopian tube: Serous cystadenofibroma.

B.  Uterus: Inactive/weakly proliferative endometrium. No evidence of atypical complex hyperplasia or malignancy.

C.  Left ovary and fallopian tube:
