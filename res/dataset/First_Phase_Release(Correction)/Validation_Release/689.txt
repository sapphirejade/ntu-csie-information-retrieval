CLINICAL:
Sarcoma excised left chest wall 18 months ago. 
- high grade, pleomorphic.
- pectorals excised en bloc.
Followed by XRT.
Now has recurrence atmedial edge of radiation field, on anterior left manubrium. 
- wide excision of seroma cavity, with manubrium, medial end clavicle, medial 1st and 2nd ribs.  HTN, DM
-oblique skin ellipse.
- short stitch superior (at sternal notch)
- single long stitch at lateral end of 1st rib.
- double long stitch at lateral end of 2nd rib.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "L chest wall lesion short stich superior single long 1st rib double long 2nd rib", consists of a specimen of skin (105 x 40mm) subcutaneous fatty tissue and muscle (120 x 100 x 40mm), upper sternum (70 x 35 x 20mm), medial end of clavicle (30 x12 x 12mm), anteromedial end of 1st rib (52 x 20 x 17mm) and anteromedial end of 2ndrib (35 x 15 x 10mm).  The upper sternum measures (70 x 35 x 20mm).  There are three marking stitches as described.  There is a 75mm long elliptical scar on the skin.  Margins are inked in three colours, superficial blue, lateral red anddeep black.  The lower half of the specimen is horizontally separated from the upper half which has the portions of sternum, 1st and 2nd ribs and clavicle.  On slicing there is a 45 x 40 x 12mm cavity in the inferior part of the specimen, below the 2nd rib; this extends to the lateral edge of the specimen.  
The lower half is serially sectioned into 13 slices from lateral to medial.  There is an ill-defined pale area with rubbery consistency (?fibrosis) surrounding the cavity and extending medially measuring up to 55mm in maximum dimension.  No solid nodules are identified.  
The upper part of the specimen (including the bones) is serially sliced from lateral to medial into ten slices.  There is a tan solid mass expanding the manubrium (slices three and four), measuring 25 x 15 x 10mm.  This mass is well-defined andis 3mm from the anterior and 16mm from the posterior surfaces.  
There is also a cavity anterior to and abutting the sternum, and slightly superior to the 2nd rib, measuring 30 x 20 x 18mm (slices five to seven).  The cavity is partially filled with soft haemorrhagic material.  It is 11mm from the superficial and 6mm from the deep margin, and is well away from all other margins.
Blocks: 1 - representative slice one (lateral margin); 2 - cavity on superficial margin slice three; 3 - inferior margin slice three; 4 and 5 - paired sections skin and cavity; 6 - deep margin and slice four; 7 - deep margin slice six; 8 - inferior margin slice six; 9 - skin slice seven; 10 and 11 - paired sections ?fibrotic area and deep margin (margin in block 11);12 - representative slice thirteen (medial margin) please see diagram; 13 - shave left clavicle margin; 14 first rib margin; 15 - shave left 2nd rib margin; 16 - right 1st rib shave margin; 17 & 18 - paired sections, superior 3rd of slice four (17 - superficial; 18 - deep); 19 & 20 - paired sections, superior 3rd of slice five (19 - superficial; 20 - deep); 21 to 23 - continuous section showing cavity lower manubrium and first rib, slice six; 24 - lower cavity manubrium and 2nd rib.  Please see the diagram and the photos.  (TO: KQ; MY/rt 3.3.64); Re-select - 25 and 26 paired sections superior slice six; 27 and 28 - paired sections cavity and manubrium slice seven.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Ruta):
Sections of the described cavity anterior to and abutting the sternum in the superior part of the specimen show a deposit of high grade pleomorphic sarcoma.  Thisinvolves the bone of the manubrium (block 28) and adjacent soft tissue.  It has a pushing margin and much of it is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue.  Decalcification has affected tumour preservation but it is cellular and composed of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Numerous multinucleate tumour giant cells are present.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Tumour abuts the first rib but the rib is not involved.  The second rib is also not involved by tumour.  Tumour within manubrium is 3mm from the deep excision margin but there is intact bone between tumour and the margin.  Other margins are well clear.
Sections of the described tan mass expanding the manubrium show dense fibrous tissue expanding and partly replacing the bone; no tumour is seen in this region.  Sections from the inferior part of the specimen show an old seroma cavity with surrounding dense fibrous tissue.  There is some old fat necrosis in the surrounding tissue, with associated mild patchy chronic inflammation.  Adjacent muscle is atrophic.  No tumour is seen in the inferior part of the specimen.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left chest wall:  Recurrent high grade pleomorphic sarcoma involving manubrium and adjacent soft tissue.
