***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: BRAF MUTATION ANALYSIS (8.5.2064)

CLINICAL:
?Melanoma R shoulder.  ?Malignant STT with adjacent satellite or lymphnode.  Excision and posterior neck dissection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right neck dissection, short stitch level 5, medium stitch level 3, long stitch level 2" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue with threesutures for orientation, short suture marking level 5 mid suture, medial suture marking level 3 and a long stitch marking level 2.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 1 to 5mm across.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - level 2 lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - level 3 lymph nodes; 5 - level 5 lymph node; 6 - level 5 fatty tissue looking for more lymph nodes.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Lesionneck, mass suture medial margin, 12 o'clock" consists of a ellipse of skin with one suture for orientation marking the medial margin (12 o'clock) and measures 130mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 80mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 50mm in thickness.  On the surface of the skin there is a nodular area with retracted centre measuring 60 x 30mm.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  The deep margin appears to be covered by skeletal muscle.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue, the 9 o'clock margin black, deep margin green.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into fifteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice fifteen 6 o'clock margin.  In slices five to nine there is a solid poorly defined white tan lesion measuring 40mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 40mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 30mm inmaximum thickness.  Macroscopically all the margins appear clear of tumour.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram. 
Blocks: 1 - TS of 12 o'clock margin; 2 to 9 - slice seven; 10 to 16 - slice eight; 17 - slice fifteen.    (PG/ta 19/3/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr B Zoutte):
A. Twelve lymph nodes identified show no evidence of metastatic tumour.
B. Sections show skin with prominent solar elastosis excised to the level of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from Laverty Pathology (labelled 09-YANF 13231 Wyont, B 099051132; see also review report by Dr B Depung 09Y05113). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cellswith bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are prominent. The appearance is that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis is seen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.
Excision appears complete and the excision margins are as follow:
	12 o'clock	>10mm
	3 o'clock	8mm
	6 o'clock	>10mm
	9 o'clock	>10mm
	Deep	>10mm

The overlying skin shows a scar in keeping with previous excision. The epidermis appears attenuated in areas with increased numbers of basal melanocytes displaying mild cytologic atypia. However, lentiginous proliferation of these melanocytes is not seen. Subepithelial collections of lymphocytes are focally present but no definite features ofa regressed melanocytic lesion are identified.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right neck dissection
- NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC TUMOUR IN TWELVE LYMPH NODES (0/12)
B. Excision of lesion, neck
- CONSISTENT WITH MALIGNANT MELANOMA, MARGINS CLEAR

***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: BRAF MUTATION ANALYSIS (8.5.2064)

Report from KINGAROY HOSPITAL & COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE Cancer Centre
Reported by Riede, German 6.5.2064
SPECIMEN
Received from the SANDRINGHAM HOSPITAL Hospital MACKAY, 1 block labelled "09Y05113_B4".
PATHOLOGY
Histological Typing: Spindle cell malignancy
The sample was reviewed by apathologist and was considered to have 50% tumour cells within the area selected for analysis.
TEST DESCRIPTION
The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]). Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation. This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.
RESULT	NO MUTATION DETECTED

INTERPRETATION
No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors.
Comments
BRAF mutations are foundin 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]. V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed toinhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients. Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]. The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].
