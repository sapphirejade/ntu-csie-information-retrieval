:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes plus ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 54g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 45 x 20mm. The serosal surface of the uterus is focally roughened. The ectocervix measures 25 x 22mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness andthe myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 25mm in length up to 7mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 10 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The leftovary measures 22 x 10 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 35mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.  There are nodular deposits overlying the surface of left ovary and left fallopian tube.Also there is an ill-defined roughened right parametrial area 25mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks: 1 and 2 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 3 and 4 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 5 - the right ovary bisected; 6 - all of the right fallopian tube; 7 - ill-defined roughened right parametrial area; 8 - left ovary bisected including the ?surface nodular deposits; 9 and 10 - all of left fallopian tube; 11 and 12 - sections of uterus, the roughened serosal areas.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of omental fatty tissue 275 x 135 x 12mm.  Slicing reveals two ill-defined pale nodules 15 and 22mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - representative sections.
C.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid epiploica", consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue 70 x 65 x 15mm in aggregate.  There is extensive dark red/brown discolouration over thesurface of the fragment.  There is an ill-defined pale are 10mm in maximum dimension (?tumour deposit).
Blocks: 1 - ?tumour deposit; 2 to 5 - representative.
D.  Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists of  a vermiform appendix 40mm in length and up 6mm in diameter with attached mesoappendiceal fatty tissue 42 x 30 x 10mm.  The serosal surface of the appendix is partially haemorrhagic.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  Over the mesoappendiceal fat there is an ill-defined pale to red solid area 32mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - tip of the appendix bisected and two TS mid appendix; 2 - the base bisected; 3 - representative mesoappendiceal fatty tissue, all of the vermiform appendix is blocked.
E.  Specimen labelled "Gastrocolic omental implants", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 10 x 5 x 5 and attached nodule 10 x 5 x 2mm.  AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall peritoneum", consists of a piece of peritoneal fatty tissue 35 x 20 x 6mm.  There is a tan solid nodule 18mm in maximum dimension over the peritoneal surface. 
Blocks: 1 - representatives.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas", consists of a piece of tan solid tissue 25 x 10 x 5mm and two pieces of red solid tissue 25 x 17 x 5mm in aggregate.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - AE.
(TO: AJ;CS/vo 8.4.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. D Swayzer):
A.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the cervical and uterine serosa, the outer myometrium, paradnexal soft tissues, left tubal serosa and the surface of the left ovary.  The ectocervical and endocervical mucosa appear unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive.  
B, C, E, F & G.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the appendiceal serosa and periappendiceal fat.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin involving the omentum, sigmoid, appendix, peritoneum, Pouch of Douglas, surface of the left ovary and tube, uterine serosa and outer myometrium.
