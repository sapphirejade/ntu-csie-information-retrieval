CLINICAL:
Previously excised malignant colon polyp.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon" consists of a segment of colon, unorientated, measuring 120mm in length and 20mm in maximum diameter.  A piece of mesenteric adipose tissue is attached 120 x 120mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The mucosal surface shows an area of ulceration measuring 3mm in diameter and located 10mm from one of the surgical margins, possibly representing a previous polyp resection site.  Thereis a small polyp 5mm located 3mm from the opposite surgical margin.  Several diverticula are present.  The margin close to the polyp is inkedblue, the opposite margin is inked black.  
Blocks:  1 and 2 - longitudinal sections through previous polyp resection site; 3 - LS of surgical margin; 4 - polyp; 5 and 6 - representative diverticulum; 7 to 20 - mesenteric adipose tissue containing lymph nodes. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal rectum" consists of a piece of rectal mucosa containing a stapled margin.   AE 1 block.    (WE/vo 19.8.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Nordstrand):
A.  Sections show acutely inflamed granulation tissue, scar and tattoo pigment consistent with a previous polypectomy site.  No residual polyp or invasive malignancy is identified in this area.  The additional small polyp represents a possible hyperplastic polyp.  Uncomplicated diverticular disease is also present.  Seventeen (17) lymph nodes are identified which show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B.Sections of colonic mucosa show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A & B.  Sigmoid colon and distal rectum:  
- Scar and granulation tissue consistent with previous polypectomy site.
- No residual polyp orinvasive malignancy identified.   
- Uncomplicated diverticular disease.  
- Seventeen (17) negative lymph nodes.
