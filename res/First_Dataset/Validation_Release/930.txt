CLINICAL:
Large colon/terminal ileal mass.  Background ulcerative colitis.  Right hemicolectomy with gonadal vessels.  Peritoneal nodules.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy, 180 x 70 x 70mm.  It is comprised of terminal ileum, 120 x 50 x 50mm and caecum, 80 x 40 x 40mm.  In the terminal ileum there is a large mass, 80 x 70 x 50mm.  It is located 70mm from the proximal margin and 80mm from the distal margin and 20mm from ileocaecal valve. The ileal mucosa has a polypoid appearance and the caecal mucosa is firm and nodular.   On sectioning the tumour has a white and fleshy cut surface with small areas of haemorrhage.  Macroscopically the tumoue infiltrates the pericolic fat. 
Blocks:  1 - proximal margin; 2- distalmargin; 3 to 5 - tumour with terminal ileum; 6 - tumour with terminal ileum; 7 - tumour with ileocaecal valve; 8-9 - tumor with caecal mucosa 10 & 11 - tumour with serosal surface (block 11 - reserve block); 13 to 17 - lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Peritoneal nodule" consists of a nodule, 15 x 10 x 5mm.  The cut surface is tan and smooth.  Specimen BAE 1 block.  (RY/mm 16.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Plouffe & Dr D Johnstad):
A.  Sections of terminal ileum and caecum show diffuse infiltration by tumour composed of loosely cohesive medium to large cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  Abundant mitoses and apoptotic bodies are present.  The tumour infiltratesthrough muscularis propria and into the mesenteric adipose tissue.
The tumour cells show positive staining with CD20, CD10, CD43 and bcl-2.  They are negative for CD21, CD23 and cyclin-D1.The CD3 and CD5 stains highlight intermingled reactive T-lymphocytes.  The Ki-67 index is approximately 90%.
The histological features and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with diffuse large B cell Lymphoma.
The tumour is well clear of the ileal and colonic surgical margins.  Fifteen lymph nodes are identified which show no significant abnormality.  The remainder of the colon shows no significant abnormality. 
B.  Sections show diffuse large B cell lymphoma similar to the seen in specimen A. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right hemicolectomy:
- Diffuse large B cell Lymphoma
- 15 negative lymph nodes
B.  Peritoneal nodule:  Diffuse large B cell Lymphoma.
