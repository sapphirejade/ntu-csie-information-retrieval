CLINICAL:
Likely BRCA 2 carrier.  Breast cancer at age 32.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries for histopathology with filshie clipsfrom previous tubal sterilisation.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes + ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 64g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 50 x 25mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and is focally haemorrhagic.  
On opening, the endometrium measures less than 1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 13mm.  A 4mm polyp is present within the posterior endocervical canal.  A 14mm endometrial polyp is present within the anterior fundus.  A haemorrhagic tract (?surgical) is found running obliquely from posterior lower segment to the serosal surface through the myometrium.  The tract does not penetrate serosa.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  
The right fallopian tube measures 57mm in length and up to 5mm in diameter.  It is interrupted medially by a tubal ligation clip.  The right ovary measures 29 x 15 x 6mm and has an atrophic cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 54mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The left tube is disrupted medially although the tubal ligation clip is not identified.  The left ovary measures 22 x 14 x 6mm and has an atrophic cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix (includes endometrial polyp); 4 - further representative anterior body; 5 to 7 -full LS posterior body and cervix (includes haemorrhagic tract through myometrium); 8 - endocervical polyp; 9 - further representative posterior body; 10 to 11 - right ovary TS AE; 12 to 14 - right fallopian tube TS AE (12 - medial third; 13 - mid third; 14 - lateral third); 15 to 16 - left ovary TS AE; 17 to19 - left fallopian tube TS AE (17 - medial third; 18 - mid third; 19 - lateral third).   (TI/bl 24/1/62)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Nicolaus):
The ectocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endocervix has a benign polyp.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a benign polyp.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes have been examined in their entirety and show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, ovaries and tubes:  No significant abnormality detected.
