CLINICAL:
Right axillary SLNB.  IDC 9 o'clock right breast.  Right mastectomy (suture 12 o'clock).  IDC at 9 o'clock3cm FN.  Right axillary clearance (positive SLNB).  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "(R) Axillary lymph node" consists of one lymph nodemeasuring 5 x 4 x 4mm.  AE 1 block.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
Malignant cells present.  
Phone result to Chester Schweikert (surgical reg) by Dr I Mattiace at 4.05pm.
B.  Specimen labelled "(R) Axillary lymph node no 2" consists of one lymph node measuring 10 x 8 x 5mm.  Specimen serially sectioned and imprints done.
AE 1 block.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy.  
Phone result to Dr I Buzzard (surgical reg) by Dr I Ziff at 4.05pm.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch axillary tail" consists of a mastectomy measuring 190mm(medial to lateral) x 155mm (superior to inferior) x 50mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of skin on the surface measuring 170 x 180mm with a nipple areola complex.  There is an area of skin puckering 20mm from the nipple areola complex.  On sectioning there is a firm stellate tumour at 9 o'clock, 30mm from the nipple measuring 20 x 15 x 20mm.  The margins are as follows:  20mm (deep), 40mm (inferior), 58mm (superior), 18mm (superficial), 60mm (medial) and 120mm (lateral).  There is a firm area, 5mm from the tumour which measures 4 x 4 x 3mm.  There are also firm nodular areas medial to the main tumour over an area of 10 x 10 x 10mm.  Elsewhere the breast tissue appears unremarkable.  One lymph node is found within the axillary tail.  Nodular area to tumour is 30mm.  The random section from lower inner quadrant to tumour is approximately 50mm.
Blocks:  1- nipple areolar complex; 2 to 4 - tumour (block 2 - full face of main tumour and superficial margin, block 3 - tumour with adjacent firm area; block 4 - tumour and deep margin); 5 & 6 - lower inner quadrant (blocks 6 nodular area); 7 & 8 - upper inner quadrant; 9 & 10 - upper outer quadrant; 11, 12 & 13- lower outer quadrant. 14 - inferior margin; 15 - superior margin; 16 - lateral margin; 17 - breast tissue between tumour and nodular area.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary clearance" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 100 x 80 x 20mm.  Lymph nodes are identified from 3 to 15mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2- one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node bisected;5 - lymph nodes; 6 - lymph nodes; 7 - ?lymph node.  (TO: DE:  JA/mm 3.2.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr R Tynan)
A.One (1) lymph node contains a 4.5mm deposit of metastatic ductal carcinoma.  No extranodal invasion is seen.  
B.  One (1) lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).  The CAM5.2 keratin immunostain is negative.
C.  Sections show an infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  There is associated retraction of the overlying skin but no dermal or lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The carcinoma has the following features:

Invasive carcinoma: 
Site: Right breast 9 o'clock 3cm FN. 
Type: Infiltrating ductal, NST.
Invasive tumour size: 20mm.
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 3.
Tubules: 3     Nuclei:  3    Mitoses:  3    Mitotic rate: 21/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion:  Not seen.
	    
DCIS component:  
DCIS:  Present within and beyond the confines of the invasive tumour and also in the lower inner and upper inner quadrants.
Maximum extent of DCIS:   Distributed across at least 50mm (gross estimate) including the nodular area medial to the main tumour described grossly, which is  tumoural DCIS measuring at least 15.5mm.
Nuclear grade:  Intermediate and high.
Architecture:  Solid, cribriform and comedo. 
Necrosis:   Present. 
Calcification:  Not seen.
Degree of DCIS in tumour:  Focal
DCIS in adjacent tissue:  Moderate. 
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:  
-  All margins well clear >10mm 
In-situ component: . 
-  Deep 7.5mm
-  Superficial  9mm
-  Other margins well clear.
Receptors (Block C2): 
ER:  Positive
	95 % of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining:  Strong
PR:  Negative
	Focal staining of less than 1% of nuclei
	predominant intensity of staining:  Moderate
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): Equivocal (2+)
HER2 SISH:  Performed at SEALS Central, St George Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 index:  Approximately 20%.
Nipple:  Not involved. 
Pagetoid involvment:  Not seen.
LCIS / ALH:    Not seen. 
Miscellaneous:  The firm area described grossly corresponds to focal fibroadenomatoid change.  Elsewhere the breast lobules show atrophic changes.
Sentinel lymph node(s) (specimens A & B):
Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 2. 
Number of sentinel lymph nodes involved by tumour:    1.      
Number of sentinel nodes with metastases >2.0mm:     1.
Extranodal extension:  Not seen.
Axillary/other nodes:
Number of axillary lymph nodes examined: 7.
Number of axillary lymph nodes involved by tumour:   0.       
Number of axillary nodes with isolated tumour cells <0.2mm:   0.    
Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined (including sentinel node(s)):  9.  
Total number of involved lymph nodes (includingsentinel node(s)):  1.
DIAGNOSIS:
A-C.  Right axillary sentinel lymph nodes, right mastectomy and right axillary dissection:  
-  20mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST; ER positive, PR negative , HER2 SISH to follow; margins clear; intermediate and high grade DCIS distributed across at least 50m, margins clear; metastatic carcinoma in one (1) of two (2) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes; seven (7) negative right axillary lymph nodes (total 1/9).
