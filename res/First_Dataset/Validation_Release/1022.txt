CLINICAL:
64 yr old woman presumed endometrioid cancer through curettings.  ER PR negative.  Intraop frozen section of left common iliac lymph node sent to assist surgical decision making.  Modified radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, left common iliac nodes.  Pyometra noted at opening uterus intraop.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of ?three lymph nodes.  Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3- remainder of tissue AE.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Large node contains capsular aggregates of metastaticcarcinoma.  One other smaller node has one or two tiny clusters of suspicious cells.  
Phone result to Dr Ference by Dr I Grantier/I Menes at 9.50am on 07.08.13.
.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 115g.  The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 25mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 30 x 30mm and appears unremarkable.  A slightly roughened cream polypoid area is identified in both the anterior and posterior uterus measuring 25 x 22mm (anteriorly) and 45 x 30mm (posteriorly).  Posteriorly there are larger amounts of roughened loose material received in the canal.  Anteriorly this tumour appears to invade to a maximum depth of 20mm over a total wall thickness 25mm.  Posteriorly the tumour appears to invade to a maximum depth of 18mm over a wall thickness of 24mm.  The tumour extensively involves the lower segment and canal.  The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  The right ovary measures 30 x 14 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 6mm.  The left ovary measures 25 x 14 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body andcervix; 5 to 8 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 9 & 10 - further anterior uterus and cervix at deepest point of invasion; 11 to 13 - further posterior uterus and cervix at deepest point of invasion; 14 - right tube; 15 - right ovary; 16 - left tube; 17 - left ovary; 18 - reserve block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of partly tan and fatty tissue 25mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO:  RH: WM/mm 10.10.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr I Ruhmann) 
A.  One of three lymph nodes shows tiny subcapsular and sinus deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  (These are best seen on the frozen section slide).
B.  Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endocervix, with a maximum depth of invasion of 20mm through a wall 21mm thick, and a length of 56mm.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  There is no associated AIS or CIN.  Tumour is well clear (>10mm) of the vaginal cuff margin.
The tumour is strongly and diffusely positive for p16, focally positive for CEA, negative for Vimentin and PR, and focally weakly positive for ER.
 
C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endocervix, depth 20mm through a wall 21mm thick, length 56mm.  One of five (1 of 5) lymph nodes shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.
