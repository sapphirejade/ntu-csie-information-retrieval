CLINICAL:
Stage IBI cervical cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube, weighing 150g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 60 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and appears indurated over an area of 15 x 15mm anteriorlyand 15 x 10mm posteriorly.  The anterior cervical neck margin is inked blue while the posterior is inked black.  On sectioning the endometrium is 4mm in maximal thickness while the myometrium is 28mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length, 6mm in external diameter.  An elongated tissue measuring 25mm in length, 5mm in external diameter is attached to the right aspect of the uterus but no obvious fallopian tube is identified.  A moderate amount of attached parametrial fatty tissue is present measuring 40 x 25 x 10mm on the left and 30 x 25 x 6mm on the right.  Representative sections in 55 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 to 16 - anterior cervix all embedded from right to left; 17 to 20 - full longitudinal section of anterior body; 21 to 23 - further representative sections of anterior body; 24 to 40 - posterior cervix all embedded from left to right; 41 - 44 - full longitudinal section of posterior body; 45 to 47 - further representative section of posterior body; 48 - left fallopian tube; 49 - ?right fallopian tube; 50 to 53 - left parametrial fatty tissue all embedded; 54 & 55 - right parametrial fatty tissue all embedded.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac nodes" consists of four irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 7 x 4 x 3mm to 30 x 20 x 5mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 3 to 15mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2blocks.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - two lymph nodes in each.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator node" consists of six irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 7 x 3 x 3mm to 30 x 10 x 5mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 3 to 12mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - four lymph nodes in each; 3 - three lymph nodes. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac nodes" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm containing a single lymph node measuring 12mm across.  Lymph node AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator nodes" consists of three irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 20 x 10 x 5mm to 30 x 20 x 8mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 1 to 18mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 - four lymph nodes; 2 - two lymph nodes. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac nodes" consists of three irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 6 x 5 x 5mm to 10 x 10 x 5mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 6mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 &2 - three lymph nodes in each.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 20 x 5 x 3mm and 50 x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 4 to 22mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2- two lymph nodes; 3 - three lymph nodes.  
(TO: PG; TI/mm 2.12.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr F Dover): 
A.   Sections of the cervix show some residual CIN 3 on both the anterior and posterior lips.  Also, onthe posterior lip centrally, there are small foci of residual invasive squamous cell carcinoma (blocks 31, 33).  Maximum width of the residual invasive tumour is 8mm, maximum length is 3mm, and depth is 1mm.  No lymphovascular invasion isseen.  The residual invasive tumour is greater than 15mm from the ectocervical excision margin. The ectocervical excision margin is also free of CIN 3.  Scarring and chronic inflammation consistent with the recent cone biopsy is also present in the cervix. The endocervical columnar epithelium shows extensive tubal metaplasia but is otherwise unremarkable.  
Sections of the endometrium show that this in proliferative phase.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Sections of the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube stump are unremarkable.  Sections of right and left parametrial tissues are unremarkable. 
B.   Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
C.Sections show eleven lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
E.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
F.   Sections show six lymph nodes.No tumour is seen.  
G.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Uterus and fallopian tubes:  CIN 3 and focal residual squamous cell carcinoma.  
B.   Right external iliac nodes:  No tumour (0/4).
C.   Right obturator nodes:  Notumour (0/11).
D.   Right common iliac node:  No tumour (0/1).
E.   Left obturator nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
F.   Left common iliac nodes:  Notumour (0/6).
G.  Left external iliac nodes:  No tumour (0/6).
