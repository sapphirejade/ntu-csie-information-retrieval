SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (26.3.63):


CLINICAL:
Stomach cancer.  Proximal gastric adeno Ca.  Please note histopathology report Lab no.  48L82308.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Stomach" consists of a specimen of stomach (150 x 70 x 45mm), lesser omentum (120 x 50 x 15mm) and greater omentum (270 x 150 x 20mm).  The stomach measures 170mm along the greater curve and 135mm along the lesser curve.  At the proximal end there is a 15mm long segment of distal oesophagus.  There is a 32 x 28 x 8mm indurated tumour within the proximal stomach along the lesser curve.  The tumour is 24mm from the proximal and 110mm from the distal resection margin.  It is a fungating tumour (Borrmann type 2) with raised edges and a depressed centre.  The cut surface is pale and indurated.  It invades through the stomach wall and abuts the adventitial surface.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the greater and lesser omentum.    
Blocks: 1 to 3 - tumour in relation to proximal margin, LS; 4 to 6 - tumour and adventitial surface through deepest penetration of tumour (5 - reserve block); 7 - tumour and adventitial surface; 8 & 9 - representative LS proximal oesophageal margin (no macroscopically visible tumour in these sections); 10 - tumour and adjacent gastric mucosa; 11 - one trisected lymph node; 12- one bisected lymph node; 13 - one bisected lymph node (marked by suture); 14 - up to five lymph nodes; 15 - up to five lymph nodes; 16 - one trisected lymph node; 17 - two lymph nodes (blocks 11 to 17 - lymph nodes from lesser omentum); 18 - distal margin, LS; 19 - one bisected lymph node; 20 - up to five lymph nodes; 21 - up to three lymph nodes; 22 - one bisected lymph node (19 to 22 - lymph nodes from the greater omentum).
B.  Specimen labelled "Coeliac node" consists of ten fragments of fibrofatty tissue 55 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  There are several indurated lymph nodes present.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - each one bisected lymph node; 4 - up to fivelymph nodes; 5 - up to three lymph nodes.  (TO: UA; SH/ta 23/3/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr LLeigh): 
A.  Sections show a 32mm diameter moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cardia.  It invades through the stomach wall into adventitial fat andcomes very close to the adventitial resection margin.  There is metastatic tumour in two out of twenty six nodes which were found with the specimen; one involved node is in the lesser omentum and one is in the greater omentum.  
A synoptic report follows:

Barrett's mucosa:  Present (short segment).  Normal squamous mucosa present at proximal oesophageal margin.
B.  Sections show thirteen lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Total gastrectomy:  Moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (WHO), intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (Lauren) of cardia.  Tumour 0.5mm from adventitial soft tissue margin.  pT3 N1.   Stage 2B.  
B.  Coeliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/13).  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (26.3.63):
A.  Her-2 status:  The tumour cells show 3+ positivity by immunostaining (regarded as positive).
