CLINICAL:
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade 1.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes + ovaries" consists of a partly opened uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 85.8g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 43 x 37mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 26mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium has a tan granular appearance over an area of 24 x 15mm (anteriorly) and 15 x 14mm (posteriorly).  The cut surface shows firm cream tumour which invades 4mm into myometrium which is 15mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids measuring 7 and 10mm across.  The right fallopian tube measures 15mm in length, 4mm in external diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 10 x 9mm and appears macroscopically normal.  The left fallopian tubemeasures 50mm in length, 5mm in external diameter.  The left ovary also appears grossly normal and measures 24 x 10 x 9mm.  
Representative sections in 23 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 -anterior body further representative sections; 9 to 12 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 13 & 14 - posterior body further representative sections; 15 to 18 - right fallopian tube all embedded;19 - right ovary bisected all embedded; 20to 22 - left fallopian tube all embedded; 23 - left ovary bisected all embedded.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of an irregular piece of omental fat measuring 120 x 65 x 10mm.  The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue.  No obvious focal mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
(TO: YH; AJ/mm 14.1.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Hadsall): 
A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 7mm were total myometrial thickness is 17mm.  The tumour shows some squamous and mucinous differentiation.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Tumour focally involves glands in the upper endocervix but no cervical stromal invasion is seen.  The vaginal cuff excision margin is well clear.  Sections of the ovaries and the fallopian tubes do not show any significant abnormality.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  
B.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  Myometrial invasion <50%.  Stage 1A.  
B.  Omental biopsy:  No tumour.
