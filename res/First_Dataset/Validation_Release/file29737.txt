D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left posterior peritoneum&amp;quot;, consists of an unoriented irregular piece of grey tan fibrofatty tissue, 32 x 16 x 11mm.  No focal lesions seen on serial slices.  RS in 3 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus cervix right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix and ?right tube and right ovary weighing 180 grams in total.  The uterus is 85 x 65 x 48mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix is 42 x 42mm and shows tan brown tumour protruding from the os.  The anterior paracervical tissue is inked blue and the posterior is inked black.  Opening the uterus coronally shows a 42 x 23 x 9mm polypoid tan brown lesion with its base attached in the lower uterine segment/upper cervical canal and the exophytic component protruding inferiorly into the cervical canal and protruding through the os.  Sections show at the base of the polypoid lesion that the lesion has a thickness of 7mm where the total wall thickness is 18mm.  No convincing myometrial invasion is seen.  The remaining endometrium is 2 to 3mm thick and the myometrium is up to 22mm thick with no focal lesion.  The possible right fallopian tube is 23 x 6mm.  The right ovary is 15 x 14 x 12mm.  Possible left fallopian tube is 15 x 6 x 5mm.  Blocks: 1 to 29 - the anterior half of the lower uterine segment and cervix in fourteen slices from left to right each bisected with blocks 14 to 18 a full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 30 to 54 - the posterior half of the posterior half of the lower uterine segment and cervix in twelve slices from right to left each bisected with blocks 40 to 44 a full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 55 and 56 - possible right fallopian tube; 57 and 58 - right ovary trisected; 59 - possible left fallopian tube.   All of the possible tubes embedded.
F.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left external iliac lymph node 2&amp;quot;, consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 50 x 33 x 12mm in aggregate.  Two possible lymph nodes identified, 14 and 16mm.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - each have one lymph node bisected.
G.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left obturator lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of a 54 x 35 x 15mm unoriented fibrofatty tissue.  Five possible lymph nodes identified, 5 to 47mm.
Blocks: 1 - four ?lymph nodes; 2 to 4 - one lymph node trisected.
H.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right external iliac lymph nodes 2&amp;quot;, consists of two unoriented pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 53 x 28 x 12mm in aggregate.  Two possible lymph nodes identified, 18 and 22mm.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 to 4 - one lymph node trisected.
I.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right obturator lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of multiple unoriented pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 52 x 37 x 16mm in aggregate.  Eleven possible lymph nodes identified, 32 x 24mm.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - each have four ?lymph nodes; 3 - two ?lymph nodes; 4 and 5 - one lymph node bisected.
J. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right common iliac lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of  two unoriented pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 24 x 13 x 6mm in aggregate.  A 20mm lymph node is identified.
Blocks: 1 - lymph node bisected.
K.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left common iliac lymph nodes&amp;quot;, consists of two unoriented pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 10 x 8 x 3mm in aggregate.  Definite lymph node is not identified.
AE 1 block.      (TO:SW/vo 27/7/68)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Fenley):
A.  Sections show a simple serous cyst of the ovary together with a hydrosalpinx.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.  Cystic endosalpingiosis is noted.
C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy. Cystic endosalpingiosis is noted.
D.  Sections show vascular fibrofatty tissue with endosalpingiosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.   Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The bulk of the tumour is located within the lower segment and is protruding down into the cervical canal.  The endocervix itself is uninvolved.  There is a tiny (length 1.2mm, depth 0.3mm) non-contiguous focus of adenocarcinoma in the anterior ectocervical stroma (block 18).  This focus is 12mm from the anterior vaginal margin.   No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The right tube is not identified.  The right ovary is unremarkable.
MSI stains are pending.
F.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Ten lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
J.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
K.  No lymph nodes are present in this tissue.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (lower segment).  No convincing myometrial invasion seen.  No lymphvascular invasion seen.  A tiny focus of non-contiguous involvement of the ectocervical stroma is present.  Twenty five (25) lymph nodes are negative.
ADDITIONAL REPORT (10/8/68):

Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins:

MLH1:  Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2:  Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2:  Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6:  Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
