CLINICAL:
Subtotal pancreas.  Bx - NETS.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Subtotal pancreas and spleen", consists of an en bloc distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.  The distal pancreas is 125 x 65 x 45mm.  The spleen is 145 x 95 x50mm, weighs 222g, and contains no focal abnormality.  There is attached unremarkable greater omentum, 285 x 200 x 15mm.  The anterior surface of the pancreas is covered by smooth peritoneum.  The proximal portion of the pancreas contains a solid tumour, 85 x 65 x 45mm.  The tumour has a fleshy tan appearance.  The border of the tumour is smooth and pushing with no infiltrative areas seen.  The tumour appears to have been excised intact, however abuts the anterior/peritoneal surface, superior and inferior margins and stapled margin adjacent to pancreatic neck.  The posterior margin overlying the tumour has a grooved area (inked blue) and a flat area located distalto the groove (inked black).  There are three stapled margins adjacent to the groove (inked green).  The tumour is 1mm clear of the inked black margin and 2mm clear of the inked blue margin.  The pancreas distal to the tumour has a lobulated yellow appearance.  A 25mm lymph node lies adjacent to the pancreatic neck.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - pancreatic tumour with stapled margin closest to pancreatic neck; 3 & 4 - tumour with grooved posterior margin; 5 - inferior aspect of tumour; 6 - superior aspect of tumour; 7 to 9 - tumour with flat part of posterior margin; 10 - central portion of tumour (reserved block); 11 - tumour with adjacent splenic artery; 12 - tumour with adjacent pancreas; 13 - uninvolved tail of pancreas; 14 - splenic hilum; 15 - splenic capsule; 16 to18 - greater omentum; 19 & 20 - TS one lymph node at pancreatic neck; 21 - one splenic hilar lymph node; 22 & 23 multiple splenic hilar lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a sheet of greater omentum 490 x 170 x 10mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
(DO/mm 4.8.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported byDr V Sagastume & registrar Dr V Calvert):
A.  Sections of the pancreas show a focallyencapsulated tumour with a multinodular growth pattern; with a maximum macroscopic dimension of 85mm.  The tumour cells are predominantly arranged in trabeculaeand acini separated by hyalinised stroma.  The tumour cells have granular cytoplasm and mainly uniform nuclei with a clumped nuclear chromatin pattern.  Moderate numbers of mitoses are seen, up to 18 mitoses per 50 high power fields (block 4).  There is no necrosis within the tumour.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen with tumour covered by endothelial cells.  No perineural invasion is seen.
The tumour shows diffuse positive staining with synaptophysin and CD56, while patchy positive staining is seen with chromogranin.  Insulin, gastrin, glucagon and somatostatin stains are essentially negative.  Positive staining is seen with PR and alpha1-antitrypsin.  The tumour is negative for CD10 and tumour nuclei are negative for beta-catenin.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is up to 5%.
The morphological, immunohistochemical and Ki-67 proliferation index of this tumour are consistent with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET), grade 2 (WHO classification, 2010). 
The tumour has a mainly pushing border, and comes to less than 0.1mm of the superior margin, 0.2mm of the posterior margin, 1mm ofthe pancreatic margin and 1.5mm of the inferior margin.  The tumour extends beyond the pancreatic parenchyma, with tumour nodules surrounded by peripancreatic adipose tissue (pT3).
The uninvolved pancreas shows residual islets of Langerhans with almost complete atrophy of the exocrine glands with fat replacement.  The spleen shows no significant abnormality.
Fifteen lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumour (0/15).
B.  Section of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Subtotal pancreas and spleen, omentum:
- Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET), grade 2.
- Surgical margins close but free of tumour.
- Fifteen negative lymph nodes
- Omentum negative
- AJCC 7th edition (2010): pT3  N0  MX.
