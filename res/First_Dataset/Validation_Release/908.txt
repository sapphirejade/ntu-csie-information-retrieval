			SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25/3/63)

CLINICAL:
Left breast mastectomy and axillary clearance levels 1 and 2. Left breast: short suture superior, long suture lateral.   Lap choly, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left breast, long stitch lateral, short superior", consistsof a simple mastectomy specimen weighing 1586.8g and measuring 170mm (medial to lateral), 240mm (superior to inferior), 70mm (superficial to deep).  The overlying ellipse of skin, 233 x 116mm bears an unremarkable nipple/areolar complex.  At 3 o'clock, 45mm from the nipple there is an area of cutaneous bruising and induration..  Superficial margin inked blue, deep margin black.  
On sectioning and at 3 o'clock, 70mm from the nipple therean firm tumour, 45mm (medial to lateral) x35mm (superior to inferior) x 30mm (superficial to deep) with adjacent haemorrhage. The tumour appears clear of the margin as follows: 55mm from the deep margin, 30mm from superficial margin and well clear (>80mm)  from lateral, medial, superior and inferior margins. Contiguous and medial to the tumour there is anarea of firm haemorrhagic breast tissue which extend to approximately 50mm from the nipple at 3o'clock.    There is also a separate cream tumour, 16 x 20 x 20mm ( ? tumour replaced intramammary lymph node) in the upper outer quadrant at 2 o'clock 80mm from the nipple and 100mm from the main tumour. It is located 10mm from the deep margin, 10mm from superior and superficial margins 30mm from the lateral margin.  There are two additonal intramammary lymph nodes 7mm and 5mm.  
Representative sections taken according to the attached diagram.  Block 1 - nipple and areola; 2 - rep. bruised indurated skin; 3 - lateral to tumour; 4 most lateral section of tumour; 5-8 -  full face of tumour;9 - rep.  tumour (reserved block); 10 -  tumour close to haemorrhagic area; 11,12, 13 and 14 - rep. of haemorrhagic area; 15 -medial  haemorrhagic area; 16 - deep margin close to tumour; 17 - nodular lesion at 2 o'clock  with anterosuperior  and posterior margin; 18 & 19 - rest of nodular lesion; 20 - two intramammary lymph nodes; 21 & 22 - representative upper outer quadrant; 23 & 24 - representative upper inner quadrant; 25 & 26 - representative lower outer quadrant; 27 & 28 - representative lower inner quadrant; 29 - superficial  inferior margin; 30 - superior section to A4; 31 -  inferior section to A4;32 -  superficial superior margin parallel to A4. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 1 axillary clearance", consists of an unorientated  piece of fatty tissue 85 x 60 x 50mm containing seventeen lymph nodes 5-30mm. Several lymph nodes appear infiltrated by tumour.  
Blocks 1-6 - two lymph nodes each; 7 & 8 - three lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Level 2 axillary clearance", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 70 x 30 x 20mm and one lymph node 7 x 7mm. Nine lymph nodes are identified measuring 7-35mm.  Several lymph nodes appear infiltrated by tumour.  Blocks 1-3 - one lymph node each; 4 & 5 - three lymph nodes each; 6 - two lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Inta (sic) pectoral lymph nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with one lymph node 20 x 12 x 5mm.  On sectioning it appears involved by tumour.  Block 1 - bisected lymph node.   (TO: PG: PG/ec 22.2.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Markert) 
Sections show a 45mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS located at 3 o'clock 70mm from the nipple.  The tumour is composed of moderately pleomorphic with occasional nucleoli and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged mainly in solid nests with minimal tubule formation within a fibrotic and focally myxoid stroma. There is prominent retraction artefact but numerous foci of definite lymphovascular invasion are seen beyond the tumour margins. The second tumour in the lateral breast at 2 o'clock 80mm from the nipple is a 20mm intramammary lymph node completely replaced by metastatic tumour (block A17) with foci of extranodal extension. It displays identical morphology to the main tumour. Two (2) other intramammary lymph nodes are free of tumour.  Eighteen (18) of twenty (29) nine left axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma (specimens B & C) and there are numerous foci of extranodal extension. One inta (sic) pectoral lymph node (specimen D) is completely replaced by tumour withextranodal extension measuring about 5mm into extranodal fat over a front of 7mm and focally invading the adventitial layer of a large vein. No striated muscle is seen around the lymph node. A synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows:
