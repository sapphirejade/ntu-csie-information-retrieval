CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma on uterine curettings.  Postmenopausal bleeding.  Family history of bowel cancer.  Histology = immunohistochemisty for mismatch repair on tumour
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 100g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 70 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface. The non- peritonealised surface of the uterus in inked black.  The endometrial cavity is filled with a tan/friable tumour measuring approximately 62 x 50 x 30mm.  Part of the surface of thetumour appears to be necrotic and is loosely attached to the endometrial surface. The myometrium contains two fibroid 10and 14mm in maximum dimension. 
 The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 8mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 27 x 15 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mmin length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix, 5 to 8 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix, 9 - section of tumour, reserved block; 10 - representative section of the two fibroids; 11 - representative sections, the necrotic part of the tumour loosely attached to surface of the endometrium;12 - right fallopian tube and ovary; 13 - left fallopian tube and ovary; 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes" consists of fibrofatty tissue 60 x 30 x 10mm.  There are up to three lymph nodes ranging from 6 to 16mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one likely bisected lymph node.
C.. Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph nodes" consists of fibrofatty tissue 45 x 40 x 15mm.  There are up to five lymph nodes.: 1 - up to four lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph nodes" consists of piece of fibrofatty tissue 70 x 25 x 100mm.  There are several lymph nodes.
Blocks: 1 - up to three lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac nodes" consists of piece of fibrofatty tissue 52 x 40 x 10mm.  There are several lymph nodes.
Blocks: 1 - up to three lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one bisected lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x 18 x 7mm.There are two lymph nodes.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph nodes" consists of a lymph node 20 x 10 x 7mm and separate piece fatty tissue 8 x 8 x 2mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of piece of fatty tissue 145 x 90 x 15mm.  Specimen is sliced.  No indurated nodules are seen.
Blocks: 1 - 3 random sections.   (TO:  HM;HM/vo 14.8.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. Z Lagrimas):
A.  Sections show a carcinosarcoma / malignant mixed Mullerian tumour of the endometrium.  The tumouris composed of serous carcinoma (60%) and sarcoma (40%) with no heterologous elements.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 2mm through a wall 10mm thick.  Prominent lymphvascular invasion is present both within the myometrium and the ectocervix (where it is present at the vaginal margin).  The ectocervix and endocervix are otherwise unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One of four lymph nodes shows metastatic carcinoma.  No extracapsular invasion is seen.
E.  Three of five lymph nodes show metastaticcarcinoma.  No extracapsular invasion is seen.
F.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  One lymph node shows metastatic carcinoma.  No extracapsular invasion is seen.
H.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Carcinosarcoma / MMMT of the endometrium, depth of invasion 2mm through a wall 10mm thick.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is present.  Five of nineteen (5 of 19) lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
