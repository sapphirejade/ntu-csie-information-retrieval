SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (12.11.63):


CLINICAL:
CA 125 was 700 but down to 27 after 5 cycles of carbotaxol.  Ascitic tap showed adenocarcinoma.  Anaemia for transfusion. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 59g in total.  The uterus measures 55 x 35 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and hasan unremarkable surface.  The endocervix has a nodular appearance over an area of 5 x 3mm anteriorly and 8 x 5mm posteriorly.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness while the myometrium is 10mm in maximum thickness. The right ovary measures 23 x 11 x 9mm and has a smooth shiny surface. Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, 5mm in external diameter and appears unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 20 x 10 x 8mm and has a smooth shinysurface.  Its cut surface shows no macroscopic abnormality.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, 5mm in external diameter and is unremarkable.  Representative sections in 23 blocks.  
Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4- anterior endocervix; 5-6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 8 & 9 - representative sections posterior body; 10-12 - right ovary, AE; 13-16 - right fallopian tube, AE; 17-19 - left ovary, AE; 20-23 - left fallopian tube, AE. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of an irregular and flattened piece of omental fat measuring 210 x 80 x 10mm. The cut surface shows at least six separate firm pale nodules measuring from 5-20mm in maximal extent.  Representative sections in 8 blocks.  Blocks 1-6 - pale nodules; 7 & 8 - uninvolved omental fat.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr W Kaldahl) 
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes; the involvement is more prominent of the right side, where the deposit measures 9mm in diameter.  No carcinoma in-situ of the tubal epithelium is identified.There are also microscopic tumour deposits on the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes and both ovaries.  There is also focal extension of tumour from the serosa into the cortex of each ovary.  Vascular invasion is identified.
There is a focus of endometriosis within the right fallopian tube wall.  
The cervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium displays cystic atrophic features. The myometrium is unremarkable.  There are small foci ofserous carcinoma on, and just beneath, the serosal surface of the anterior uterus.
B.  Sections confirm the presence of variable sized deposits of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.   Vascular invasion is identified.There is some evidence of treatment effect, with between 10 and 50% tumour replacement by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.  Metastatic carcinoma is present in two small lymph nodes which were identified (2/2).
Comment:  Thetumour involvement at the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes suggests fallopian tube origin but no carcinoma in-situ is identified in remaining tubal epithelium at the fimbrialends or elsewhere.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries:
    - Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes, and serosa of fallopian tubes, ovariesand anterior uterus.
    - Focal endometriosis right fallopian tube.  
B.  Omentum:  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
                        Two lymph nodes with metastatic serous carcinoma (2/2).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (12.11.63):
A.  Immunostains for hormone receptors have been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.  100% of tumour cells show positive staining.intensity of staining:  Strong.
Progesterone receptor:   Negative.  0% of tumour cells show positive staining.
