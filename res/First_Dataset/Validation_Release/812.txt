CLINICAL:
Interval debulking of ovarian/peritoneal cancer - neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 80g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 35mm.  The serosal surface is focally haemorrhagic over an area of 40 x 20mm posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 50 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The right fallopian tube is focally adherent to the anterior serosal surface of the uterus.  On sectioning the endometrium is1mm in thickness and the myometrium is 18mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube is 60mm in length and focally dilated up to 15mm.  The right ovary measures 25 x 20 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 50mm in length and focally dilated up to 15mm.  The left ovary measures 25 x 18 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior bodyand cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 - section from adherent fallopian tube and anterior body of uterus; 8 - representative fimbrial end of right fallopian tube; 9 & 10 -representative right ovary; 11 - section of the right ovary; 12 - sections of left fallopian tube; 13 to 15 - left ovary.  Both ovaries are  blocked in toto.
B.  Specimen labelled "Spleen + omentum" consists of spleen, 100 x 70 x 32mm with attached omental fatty tissue, 80 x 50 x 18mm.  The spleen weighs 120g.  There is a pale scar-like area 5 x 4mm on the capsular surface of the spleen, laterally.  The cut surface of the spleen appears normal.  Also on the medial surface of the spleen the capsule is focally thickened to 5mm over a surface of 20 x 20mm.  .  There are several matted indurated nodules within the omental fat the largest being 50mm in maximum dimension.  One nodule is at the splenic hilum but does not seem to be infiltrating into the spleen. Also, there is an 18 x 10 x 10mm calcified nodule with bony hard consistency within thesplenic artery.
Blocks:  1 - scar-like lateral capsular area; 2 - representative thickened medial capsular area; 3 - representative sections the omental hilar nodule; 4 - section of omental hilar nodule, reserved block for tumour bank; 5 - representative largest omental nodule; reselect block 6 - representative of the nodule within the splenic artery (in decal).
C.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon" consists of a segment of large bowel, 80mm in length with attached mesenteric fat, 70 x 35 x 40mm.  The colonic mucosa appears normal.  There is a cavity within the mesenteric fat, 40 x 35 x 30mm filled with serosanguineous  fluid.  The wall of this cavity is focally indurated.  There is an indurated nodule within the mesenteric fat, 20mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- representative two resection margins; 2 - indurated area of mesenteric cavity wall; 3 - 20mm nodule bisected; 4 - one likely mesenteric lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a ragged piece of omental fatty tissue, 120 x 70 x 28mm.  There are multiple indurated nodules occyping half of the omental tissue.  The largest nodule is 55mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 - representative sections.
E.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of a vermiform appendix, 45mm in length and up to 11mm in diameter.  The tip of the appendix appears to be encased within an indurated nodule, 17mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 - tip bisected longitudinally; 2- mid appendix, TS; 3 - base bisected longitudinally.  AE.  (TB/mm 8.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr M Clukies) 
A.  Sections show deposits of serous carcinoma on the uterine serosa, serosa of the adherent right fallopian tube, right fimbriae, serosa of the left tube, surface of both ovaries and the stroma of both ovaries. 
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis.
B.  Sections show several deposits of serous carcinoma on the splenic capsule, in the hilum, and within the omentum.
C.  Sections show a large cystic deposit of serous carcinoma within the mesentery, as well as smaller separate deposits.  The bowel wall is otherwise unremarkable.  The surgical margins are free of tumour.  Two negative mesenteric lymph nodes are noted.
D.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
E.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the appendiceal fat, serosa, muscularis propria and focal submucosa.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum and mesentery, also involving the uterine serosa, both tubes, both ovaries, splenic capsule and hilum, and appendix.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 22/4/64:
As requested, ER & PR were performed.  The tumour is strongly positive for ER and negative for PR.
