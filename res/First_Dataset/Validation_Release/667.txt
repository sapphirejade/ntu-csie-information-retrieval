SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (10.2.63):


CLINICAL:
1. . Ultra low anterior resection.  2.  Distal donut.  3.  Apical node biopsy (IMA) origin.  For histopath. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Ultra low anterior resection", consists of an anterior resection specimen, received opened, measuring 160mm in length.  The anterior peritoneal reflection is identified 33mm from the distal resection margin.  The pararectal margin however appears relatively intact in this area.  There is an ulcerated, polypoid tumour 45mm from the distal resection margin.  This involves approximately 95% of the bowel circumference and measures 80 x 65mm.  There is a polyp 15mm proximal to the main tumour measuring 10mm in maximum dimension. The cut surface reveals that the tumour invades into the muscularis propria but there is no definite invasion through into the mesenteric fat.  The remainder of the mucosa is unremarkable.  Block 1- proximal resection margin; 2- distal resection margin; 3 - separate polyp; 4-7 - tumour at deepest point of invasion; 8 - tumour to normal mucosa; 9 - apical node; 10-12 - lymph nodes above peritoneal reflection; 13 - lymph nodes below peritoneal reflection; 14 - reserve block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut", consists of a donut of mucosa 25 x 15 x 10mm.  Representative sections in 2 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Apical lymph node", consists of two pieces of tan and fatty tissue 3 and 5mm.  ? two lymph nodes identified. AE 1 block.

pT3	Beyondmuscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin: >10mm
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  22	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent.
Perineural invasion
Absent.
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Adenomas:  One tubulovillous adenoma with lowgrade dysplasia adjacent to main tumour. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
To follow.
B.   Sections show unremarkable large intestinal wall. 
C.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Ultra low anterior resection:
1.   Adenocarcinoma, no lymph node metastases.  pT3  pN0  pMx  R0.
2.   Tubulovillous adenoma. 	

B.   Distal donut:  No abnormality seen.
C.   Apical lymph node:  No tumour (0/1). 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (10.2.63):

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
