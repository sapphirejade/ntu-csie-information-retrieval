CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass CA 125 >4000.  CEA 4.3.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic mass", consists of two necrotic friable fragments 25 and 35mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks 1 & 2 - FS; 3 & 4- remaining tissue.
FROZEN SECTION:  Serous carcinoma. 
Result to Professor Isle by Dr E Basch at 12:40 on 19.12.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries, pelvic mass", consists of three parts. The first part is composed of uterus 70 x 30 x 20mm including cervix 20 x 20mm with attached grey/brownish mass 140 x 65 x 55mm in total weighing 253g.  The adnexal structures are not recognisable.  The serosal surface of the uterus appears ragged with multiple fibroadipose tissue adhesions. The endometrium is less than1mm in thickness and the myometrium is up to 9mm in maximum thickness showing no unusual features on sectioning.  Sectioning of the tumour shows a solid cystic tumour with massive necrosis and haemorrhage.  The cystic component has a multilocular appearance and comprises approximately 40% of the mass.  The second part consists of a soft fragile mass measuring 50x45x45mm. Sectioning shows extensive necrosis. The third part of the specimen consists of a portion of fallopian tube including fimbrial end 40 x 8mm with attached soft tissue 45 x 20 x 10mm.  The attached soft tissue possibly contains an atrophic ovary.  Block 1-3 - 1LS uterus; 4-12 - attached tumour; 13 & 14 - separate necrotic mass; 15 - fallopian tube; 16 - ? ovarian tissue; 17 - reserve block; 18-24 - ectocervix AE.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a 20mm lymph node with attached adipose tissue. AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of an 8mm lymph node with attached adipose tissue. AE 1 block.   
E.  Specimen labelled "Infracolic omentum", consists of a portion of omentum 240 x 80 x up to 12mm showing no unusual features.  Two representative blocks.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr E Morini) 
A.  Sections show serous carcinoma.
B.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma presumably arising from one of the ovaries and / or tubes (one separate normal ovary and tube are identified but it it unclear whether these are from the left or right).  
The endometrium is inactive.  The entire cervix has been embedded.  A small focus of CIN 3 is present (a p16 stain is positive).  This is clear of the vaginal margin.  There is no AIS.
C.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  The omentum shows no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable ovarian origin.  Two lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
A small focus of CIN 3 is present.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 25/3/64:
As requested  ER and PR were performed.  The tumour shows diffuse moderate ER staining and very focal moderate PR staining.
