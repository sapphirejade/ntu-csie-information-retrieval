F/S: &amp;quot;All fibrous + chronic inflammation&amp;quot; per phone to Dr. Willow COGGINS by Dr. A. Melamed at 12:37pm on 25/11/17.

E. &amp;quot;RIGHT SUPERIOR VESICLE (sic) ARTERY&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of firm, pale tissue, 16x10x8mm. Bisected - half embedded for frozen section.

F/S: &amp;quot;All fibrous + chronic inflammation&amp;quot; per phone to Dr. Mira SYMONS by Dr. A. Zeliff at 12:37pm on 22/12/18.

(ECP frozen section E; 2 frozen section residual tissue, trisected). AE (M-2)

F. &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, WOULD FROM THE RIGHT COLON&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple pieces of tissue.

There is a gallbladder, 68x30x25mm. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny. The cystic duct margin is inked blue. The gallbladder mucosa is green and velvety. The average wall thickness is 6mm. There are numerous gallstones within the lumen, 5-15mm in size.

(1 shaved cystic duct margin and adjacent section show gallbladder neck and possible cystic duct node; 2 transverse section of gallbladder body and longitudinal section of gallbladder fundus).

Also within the specimen jar is a segment of right hemicolectomy. The overall dimensions of this piece of tissue are 172mm in length and up to 80mm in circumference with up to 80mm of mesentery. The segment of right colon measures 80mm in length, 80mm in diameter with an average wall thickness of 5mm. The portion of ileum measures 84mm in length, 40mm in circumference with an average wall thickness of 5mm. Between the two segments of bowel, there is a line of anastomosis, 55mm in length which bears multiple sutures and staples. There is up to 80mm of mesentery which appears unremarkable. There are no mucosal lesions seen. This serosa appears haemorrhagic, but no focal lesions are seen. The proximal and distal stapled margins are inked blue.

(3 longitudinal proximal and distal margins; 4 section through anastomotic line [staples removed]; 5 representative section through haemorrhagic area and small bowel serosa; 6 haemorrhagic/congested area in large bowel serosa; 7 seven possible nodes; 8 six small nodes).

Also within the specimen jar are four pieces of unorientated fibroadipose tissue, some of which contain mesentery, 120-270mm in size, and 270x160x30mm in aggregate.

(9 three representative sections of the smallest separate piece of fibroadipose tissue containing serosa; 10 two possible nodes from a separate unorientated piece of fibroadipose tissue; 11 one bisected node from fibroadipose tissue; 12&amp;amp;13 one bisected possible tumour deposit from one separate piece of fibroadipose tissue, possibly peritoneum; 14 section through separate fibroadipose tissue showing pale area [?scarring], and muscle; 15 section through the largest separate piece of fibroadipose tissue showing bisected ?node [or ?vessicle]). RS (M-15/ LK/cy)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. A. Sluder)
A. Sections show fibrofatty tissue and smooth muscle tissue with chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B. Sections show smooth muscle tissue with adjacent fibrosis containing numerous macrophages and chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.

C. Sections show fibrous tissue with foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material. There is no evidence of malignancy.

D. Sections show fibrous tissue attached to smooth muscle with foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material. There is no evidence of malignancy.

E. Sections show fibrous tissue with mild chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.

F. Sections through the gallbladder show the features of chronic cholecystitis. A reactive cystic lymph node is also identified.

Sections through the right hemicolectomy specimen show anastomosed ileum to colon with unremarkable small bowel and colonic mucosa. Fibrous adhesions are noted on the serosal surface. 8 local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes.

Sections through separately submitted fibroadipose tissue fragments show an extranodal deposit of moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma, presumably in omentum. An adjacent reactive lymph node is also seen.

Sections through separate peritoneal fragments show mild chronic inflammation and otherwise no significant abnormalities.

DIAGNOSIS:
PERITONEAL TISSUE - RIGHT PELVIS:
- FIBROSIS, NO TUMOUR SEEN.

RIGHT PELVIS SIDE WALL:
- FIBROSIS, NO TUMOUR SEEN.

RECTUM 1:
- FIBROSIS, NO TUMOUR SEEN.

RECTUM 2:
- FIBROSIS, NO TUMOUR SEEN.

RIGHT SUPERIOR ARTERY:
- FIBROSIS, NO TUMOUR SEEN.

GALLBLADDER, PERITONECTOMY AND RIGHT COLON:
- SINGLE EXTRANODAL DEPOSIT OF MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, PRESUMABLY IN OMENTUM.
- NO TUMOUR SEEN IN RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY SPECIMEN, GALLBLADDER OR SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS.
