CLINICAL:
R lower pole renal tumour - partial nephrectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right partial nephrectomy" consists of a partial nephrectomy with attached perinephric fat 42 x 32 x 35mm.  The surgical resection margin is inked green and the renal capsule and perinephric fat is inked black.  The cut surface reveals a tan and partly haemorrhagic tumour 40 x 32 x 30mm taking up the majority of the specimen.  The tumour appears to abut the renal capsule margin and comes within 2mm of the surgical resection margin.  
Blocks: 1 - TS from one end; 2 & 3 - TS from other end; 4 & 5 - representative tumour; 6 - reserve block.(LF/ta  20/3/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Regner & Dr J Forguson):
Sections of kidney show a well circumscribed tumour arising from the renal cortex.  The tumour is composed of cords, nests and trabeculae of plump eosinophilic cells with moderate amounts of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are focal areas with cystic dilatation and other areas with a loose oedematous stroma.  The nuclei are centrallyplaced with smooth round borders, even chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.  No mitoses are identified and no necrosis is seen. The Hale's colloidal ironstain show occasional focal cytoplasmic staining.
Immunohistochemical stains show positive staining for CD117, patchy weak staining for CD10 and focal single cell staining for CK7.  The vimentin stain is negative.
The morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with a renal oncocytoma. 
The tumour abuts the renal capsule and is 2mm clear of the surgical resection margin.  The uninvolved renal tissue shows no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS
Right partial nephrectomy:
- Renal oncocytoma
- Excision appear complete
