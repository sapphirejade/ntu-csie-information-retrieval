Distribution: FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
R sided colon cancer.  R hemicolectomy.  100 year old woman with diarrhoea and anaemia.  Found to have a caecal cancer on CT/colonoscopy which has been tattooed.  Nil mets on CT.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of bowel consisting of terminal ileum 50mm in length, 30mm in maximum open circumference and right colon 150mm in length, 65mm in maximum open circumference with attached appendix 45mm in length, 7mm in maximum external dimension.  There is an exophytic cauliflower like lesion 80 x 50 x 15mm.  The lesion is located at the ileocaecal valve 80mm from the distal margin, 70mm from the proximal resection margin.  The tumour invades through the full thickness of muscularis propria to the subserosa region.  The overlying serosa is puckered but appears stillintact.  The overlying serosa is inked blue.  No other lesion is identified.  Sixteen lymph nodes identified from the pouch of caecum area ranging from 1mm across to 12mm across.
Blocks:  1 - the proximal margin; 2 to 6 - tumour with overlying serosa; 7 - TS of the appendix and LS of the distal end; 8 - distal resection margin; 9 - apical node one node; 10 - three nodes; 11 - one node bisected (largest node); 12 to 14 - three nodes in each block; 15 - two nodes. (GE/bl 16/4/64)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Debiew)
The caecal tumour is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma showing areas of mucinous differentiation. A synoptic report for invasive carcinoma follows:

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.

pTNM STAGE (TNM 7th Edition) = 2A (pT3N0MxR0)	


DIAGNOSIS:
Right hemicolectomy: 
pTNM Stage 2A moderately differentiated caecal adenocarcinoma showing areas of mucinous differentiation.
No evidence of malignancy in fifteen lymph nodes (0/15).
Markers of microsatellite instability show loss of nuclear staining for MLH1/PMS2 which may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of the mismatch repair gene.
