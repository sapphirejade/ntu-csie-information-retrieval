CLINICAL:
Peritoneal biopsy showed serous carcinoma.  Ca 125 3469.  Has had 4x cycles of carbo-taxol.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 72g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 45 x 25mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  
On opening, the endometrium measures less than 1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 16mm.  A 9mm ? endometrial polyp is present within the anterior fundus.  No other mass lesions are identified.   The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 22 x 13 x 8mm and has an atrophic cut surface. The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  A 7mm paratubal cyst is present.  The left ovary measures 20 x 12 x 9mm and has an atrophic cut surface.   
Blocks 1-3 -full LS of anterior body and cervix (includes possible polyp); 4 & 5 - further representative anterior body; 6-9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10-12 - further representative posterior uterus; 13 - representative right tube and ovary; 14 - representative left tube and ovary; 15 - representative right parametrium; 16 - representative left parametrium.
B.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule", consists of two pieces of nodular unoriented fibroadipose tissue 16 and 17mm in maximum dimension. AE 2 blocks.
Block 1 - one nodule bisected; 2 - one nodule bisected.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a 400 x 155 x 30mm piece of omental tissue.  Scattered firm nodules up to 22mm are present.  Representative 2 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Maritato) 
A.  Sections show small foci of serous carcinoma on the uterine serosa and left paradnexal soft tissues.  Serous carcinoma also involves the full thickness of the right fallopian tube.  Calcification is noted on the surface of the right ovary however this is unassociated with carcinoma cells.
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a benign polyp.  The myometrium is unremarkable.
B & C.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, also involving the sigmoid, right fallopian tube, uterine serosa and left paradenxal soft tissues.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 20/3/63:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2,MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
