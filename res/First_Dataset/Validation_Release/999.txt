SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (24.6.63):


CLINICAL:
Pelvic washings for endometrial carcinoma.  HTN.  Type 2 DM, asthma, IHD, AF.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 108g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 40 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 11mm in maximum thickness.  On sectioning, there is a well defined infiltrative endometrial lesion that measures 10mm in thickness.  The endometrium measures 17mm in maximum thickness in the area of tumour.  A 10mm diameter fibroid is noted in the myometrium.  The right fallopian tube measures 50 x 5mm and is unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 25 x 20 x 15mm and is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 50 x 5mm and shows signs of previous ligation.  The left ovary has a cystic appearance and measures 35 x 30 x 30mm.  The external surface is smooth and shiny.  On sectioning it is filled with serous fluid and the internal surface is smooth.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 - one representative section of anterior endomyometrium; 6 to 9 - one full representative section of posterior body and cervix; 10 - one representative section of posterior endomyometrium; 11 - myometrium with fibroid; 12 - right parametrial tissue; 13 - left parametrial tissue; 14 - two LS right fimbria; 15 - one LS right ovary and one TS right tube; 16 - two LS left fimbria; 17 - representative sections of left ovarian cyst; 18 - representative sections of left ovary and cyst.  (CY/cc 6/6/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Zirkles): 
Sections show that much of the endometrium is involved by a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  There is some tumour involvement of adenomyosis in the myometrium but there is alsodeep myometrial invasion in the anterior wall.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 9mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 15mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  The left ovarian cyst is a simple cyst.  The right ovary is unremarkable.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium with deep myometrial invasion, stage 1B. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (24.6.63):
Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Loss of nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Loss of nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Loss of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI) and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
