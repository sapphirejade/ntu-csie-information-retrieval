CLINICAL:
SBO due to malignant mass.  Fine peritoneal disease throughout abdomen + omental nodules.  ? appendiceal adenocarcinoma.  Diverting proximal ileostomy created.  Recent Dx metastatic pleural effusion no formal primary recognised. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of an unoriented piece of fatty and cream tissue 90 x 40 x 20mm.  An ill defined cream mass is seen to infiltrate the fatty tissue throughout the majority of the specimen.  It appears to come close to all margins.  Representative sections in 5 blocks (6 -reserve block).  (AJ/ec 16.2.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr C Sowl): 
Sections of omentum show extensive infiltration by a high grade carcinoma with solid and papillary architecture.  The tumour cells contain highly pleomorphic nuclei with coarse chromatin and occasional prominent nucleoli.  Occasional cells show smudged hyperchromatic chromatin.  Abundant mitoses are present and focal psammomatous calcification is seen. 
The tumour cells show strong positive staining with CA125 andCK7.  The CK20, CDX2 and TTF-1 stains are negative.  
The morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile is consistent with serous carcinoma of the gynaecological tract.
DIAGNOSIS:  
Omentum:  Serous adenocarcinoma.
