CLINICAL:
Likely peritoneal cancer.  Serous cancer, likely primary peritoneal.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 43g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 38 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 32 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains one fibroid 5mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 22 x 12 x 9mm.  The right ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 22 x 17 x 9mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - full longitudinal section anterior body and cervix; 3 to 5 - full longitudinal section posterior body and cervix; 6 - the myometrial fibroid; 7 - the right ovary bisected; 8 to 10 - all of right fallopian tube; 11 and 12 - all of leftovary; 13 to 16 - all of left fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omental fatty tissue 200 x 110 x 25mm.  There is a 70 x 65 x 40mm nodule within the omentum.  The nodule has solid andnecrotic cut surfaces.  There is a second pale solid nodule 35mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - representative (5 reserved block).
C.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon", consists of a U shape segment of large bowel 140mm in length with attached mesenteric fatty tissue up to 30mm in thickness.  There is a well circumscribed solid mass within the mesenteric fatty tissue 55 x 45 x 40mm.  The nodule expands to just beneath the peritoneal surface and the colonic mucosa.  The mucosa over the nodule is ulcerated.  The nodule is 27mm from one colonic margin and 55mm from the other colonic margin.  The tumour has pale solid and necrotic areas.
Blocks: 1 - the closer colonic margin, shaved; 2 - the further colonic margin, shaved; 3 and 4 - paired sections tumour and mucosa; 5 - tumour and peritoneum; 6 - tumour and mucosa; 7 - tumour and peritoneal surface; 8 - one node bisected; 9 - ? lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. W Vannorsdell):
A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is atrophic.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  There is a deposit of serous carcinoma on the left fimbriae.  There is no in situ change.  Theremainder of the left tube and the right tube are unremarkable.  Both ovaries are uninvolved.
B.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma extensively involving the omentum.  
C.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the full thickness of the colonic wall.  The surgical margins are free of tumour.  One (1) of the five (5) mesenteric lymph nodes identified showmetastatic serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum and descending colon, and also involving the left fimbriae.
