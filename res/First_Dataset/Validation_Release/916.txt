CLINICAL:
C2 nerve sheath tumour.  HCV.  Neurofibromatosis type 1.  Asthma.  Chronic back pain, appendectomy.  Mild learning impairment/DD.  Tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "C2 schwannoma" consists of two pieces of tissue.  The first is a nerve measuring up to 38 x 4mm with attached mass measuring up to 24 x 25 x 15mm.  The second piece is a nerve measuring 27 x 4mm with an attached mass 16 x 18 x 13mm.  Both pieces consist of lobulated firm white firm tissue.  
Blocks: 1 - 3TSpiece one; 2 - 2TS piece two; 3 - 5 - TS piece one; 6 &7 - TS piece two.   AE.  (TO: ED; ED/Ta 3/9/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Delossantos): 
Sections show pieces of lobulated, circumscribed spindle cell tumour.  The spindle cells havesmall nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm and are arranged in short haphazard fascicles.  The stroma is partly fibrous and partly myxoid.  There is an infiltrate of scattered small lymphocytes.There are also some ganglion cells present, mainly at the periphery of the two pieces of tumour tissue.  The ganglion cells are interpreted as being from a pre-existing ganglion rather than an integral part of the tumour.  Many of the spindle cells stain S100 positive.  The appearances are most in keeping with a neurofibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
C2 nerve sheath tumour:  Neurofibroma.
