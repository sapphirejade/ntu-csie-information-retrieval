SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.8.63):


CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass CA 125  = 821 and CA 19.9 = 40.  Large pelvic mass.  CA 125 >700. Transferred from WESTERN DISTRICT HEALTH SERVICE - COLERAINE Hospital.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a solid and cystic ovary 130 x 120 x 90mm with attached fallopian tube 50mm in length, 8mm in external diameter. The surface of the ovary is smooth and shiny.  The cut surface of the solid area shows partly necrotic fleshy cream tumour.  The cut surface of the cystic area shows several multiloculated cysts containing serous bloodstained material. The solid area occupies approximately 40% of the ovary. Representative sections in 18 blocks.  Block 1 & 2- FS; 3-13 - tumour; 14-18 - fallopian tube AE. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
Result to Anaesthetist by Dr W Oullette at 15:05pm on 13.11.12. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix + left tube + left ovary", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and left ovary weighing 96g in total. The uterus measures 85 x 60 x 30mm and has a mostly smooth and shiny serosal surface with a focally nodular area at the right cornual region measuring 25 x 15mm.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and has a moderately congested appearance.  Along the posterior endocervical canal there is an endocervical polyp measuring 5 x 4 x 3mm.  Situated within the posterior body there is an endometrial polyp measuring 25 x 8 x 7mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximal thickness while the myometrium is 26mm in maximal thickness. The myometrium contains at least two fibroids measuring from 3-22mm across.  In addition the myometrium has a nodular appearance over an area of 15 x 15 x 10mm anteriorly and 25 x 20 x 15mm at the posterior right cornua. The left ovary measures 20 x 10 x 8mm and has a smooth external surface.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length, 6mm in external diameter and appears unremarkable.   Representative sections in 23 blocks.
Block 1-5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6-9 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 10-12 - endometrial polyp, AE; 13-18 - right posterior cornual region; 19 & 20 - left ovary, AE; 21-23 - left fallopian tube AE.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of an irregular piece of omental fat measuring 185 x 140 x 10mm.  The cut surface shows at least four separate firm pale areas measuring from 4mm in maximal extent to 25 x 10 x 10mm.  The remainder of the omentum shows predominantly fatty tissue.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (TO: BH;AX/ec 16.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr W Broas) 
A.  Sections of the ovary show a poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  This consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells forming papillae and slit-like glands.  There is some patchy tumour necrosis.  Lymphovascular invasion is noted in adjacent parovarian soft tissue.  Sections of the fallopian tube show extensive involvement of the mucosa, wall and serosa by serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour in the tube wall is present within small lymphatic and/or blood vessels.  There is also extensive tumour involvement of the fimbrial end of the tube.  No definite carcinoma in situ of the residual tubal epithelium is identified.  The tumour in the fallopian tube could be metastatic from the ovary or could be part of a field effect in the Mullerian epithelium. 
B.  A section of the posterior cervix shows extensive involvement by serous carcinoma; this involvement extends from the serosal/adventitial aspect and there is extensive lymphovascular invasion.  Thelining mucosa of the cervix is not involved.  The serous carcinoma extends to the inferior excision margin of the posterior cervix.  A section of the anterior cervix also shows patchy tumour involvement just beneath the serosal/adventitial surface.  
Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  The described endometrial polyp is benign.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion by serous carcinoma in the outer myometrium and there is extensive involvement of the outer fundal myometrium by serous carcinoma.  Sections from the right posterior cornual region show extensive myometrial involvement by serous carcinoma, with prominent lymphovascular invasion.  There is also a focal, minor component of clear cell carcinoma in the myometrial tumour (blockB17).  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  
Sections of the left ovary show extensive lymphovascular invasion by serous carcinoma.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show involvement of the wall and serosa by serous carcinoma, with prominent lymphovascular invasion.  No definite carcinoma in situ of remaining tubal epithelium is seen.  
C.  Sections of omentumshow deposits of metastatic serous carcinoma.  
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr W Devall.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Right tube and ovary:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving ovary and fallopian tube.  
B.  Uterus, left tube and ovary:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma and minor component of clear cell carcinoma involving cervix, serosa and myometrium of uterus, left fallopian tube and left ovary.  Extensive lymphovascular invasion.  
C.  Omentum:  Metastatic serous carcinoma.  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (13.8.63):
A.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
