CLINICAL:
88 year old woman pelvic mass, high risk malignancy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum, 300 x 40 x 30mm containing multiple small tumour deposit.  Two representativesections for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section; 2 & 3 - representative sections from tumour deposit.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous carcinoma.  
Phone result to Dr Westby by Dr K Greg at 11.00am on 02.04.13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary" consists of a large cyst 130 x 80 x 50mm with a fallopian tube attached 130 x 5mm.  The external surface of the cyst is covered by multiple papillary excrescences.  The cyst is filled with serous fluid.  The internal surface of the cyst is shiny and smooth.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections of the cyst; 4 - two TS of fallopian tube with cyst; 5- two LS of fimbria.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right paracaval lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50 x 15 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes 30 and 25mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one bisected lymph node each; 3 -rest of fatty tissue.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac nodes" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 10 x 10mm and 25 x 5 x 5mm containing two possible lymph nodes 5mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1- two ?lymph nodes; 2 & 3 - rest of tissue.  (TO: TK: QF/mm 5.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr K Riek) 
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
B.  Sections show moderately serous carcinoma involving the ovary and the mucosa of the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube.
C.  Two of four lymph nodes show metastatic serous carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
D.One of five lymph nodes show metastatic serous carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the omentum, right ovary, fimbrial end of the right tube, and three of nine lymph nodes.
ADDITIONAL REPORT13/6/63:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
