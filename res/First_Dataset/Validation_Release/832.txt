HISTORY:  
Right colon/gallbladder/omentum/spleen/peritoneal disease.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, SPLEEN, PERITONEUM + DISEASE".  
Spleen - A spleen measuring 110x80x50mm, and weighing 260g.  The surface is covered by mucinous tumour deposits.  
(1&2 representative splenic surface with tumour deposit).
Gallbladder -  A gallbladder measuring 70mm in length and 35mm in maximal diameter. The external surface has diffuse tumour deposit measuring up to 45mm.  On opening the gallbladder mucosa is green and velvety.  There are no stones present.  
(3 representative surface tumour; 4 TS body; 5 LS fundus).
Right Colon - Right colon measuring 185mm in length including 60mmof terminal ileum. There is no appendix present.  The mesentery has an area of ? necrosis measuring 40mm in maximal extent. The serosal surface is rough with some scattered tumour deposits.  On opening the mucosa is unremarkable.  
(6 LS resection margins; 7 representative serosal tumour deposit; 8 representative necrotic mesenteric area; 9 further representative of mesenteric tumour surface deposit;10 three possible nodes; 11 one irregular sectioned node; 12 representative ascending colon mucosa).
Omentum and Peritoneal Disease - Multiple pieces of peritoneum and omentum with omental cake and diffuse tumour deposit, measuring in aggregate 200x170x120mm.  The largest piece of omental cake weighs 932g alone and measures up to 180x210x60mm.  
(13-19 representative peritoneal and omental tumour deposit, 20 RESERVE block).  RS (M-20/YV/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr N. Aiello)
Histology shows abundant extracellular mucin with intervening fibrous connective tissue septae with patchy chronic inflammation. There are scattered strips of columnar mucinous epithelium with mild to moderate (low grade) cytological atypia consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The mucinous tumour is found extensively within the omental cake with numerous peritoneal deposits and serosal deposits over the right colon, gall bladder and capsule of the spleen. The small intestinal serosa does not appear to be involved. No evidence of malignancy is seen in five mesocolic lymph nodes. No foci of frankly malignant high-grade adenocarcinoma are seen.
COMMENT:appendix is present in the specimen.  Overall morphology is in keeping with that of extensive involvement by low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Correlation with previous pathology is recommended. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, SPLEEN AND PERITONEUM -
- EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY LOW GRADE APPENDICEAL MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
