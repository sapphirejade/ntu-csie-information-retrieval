CLINICAL:
Large right renal tumour.  Previous angio-embolisation for haemorrhage.  
Right nephrectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by JG
Specimen labelled "Right kidney" consists of right kidney measuring 150mm (superior to inferior), 85mm (side to side) and 75mm (anterior to posterior) with perinephric fat up to 20mm in thickness weighing 724g.  A short segmentof proximal ureter is present 60 x 5mm.  Sectioning shows a large circumscribed tumour measuring 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour is present in the mid and lower pole and shows a heterogenous yellow greyish/brownish cut surface.  The tumourappears to abut the renal capsule and pelvis. The hilar soft tissue margin is >10mm clear of the tumour macroscopically. The renal vein and ureteric mucosa appear unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified.  The adrenal gland is identified in the superior pole 45 x 5 x 4mm showing no unusual features.  The non-neoplastic kidney shows wedge shape solid pale areas (?infarctions).  The perinephric fat at the inferior aspect shows massive haemorrhage.
Blocks: 1 - ureteric and vascular margins; 2 - pelvis and proximal renal vein; 3 - tumour and pelvis; 4 - anterior tumour; 5 - posterior tumour; 6 - inferior tumour; 7 - tumour with inferior sinus fat andhilar margin; 8 - reserve block for tissue bank; 9 - infarction; 10 - non neoplastic kidney; 11 - adrenal; 12 - perinephric fat with haemorrhage.   (HO/ta 12/7/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Turnbow):
Sections show a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 2.  The tumour is located in the mid and lower pole of the right kidney and measures 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and renal pelvis but does not infiltrate these structures.  The renal sinus is infiltrated by tumour and the vessels of the renal hilum and kidney contain embolic material.  The preoperative embolisation appears to have little effect on the viability of the tumour but the adjacent uninvolved kidney shows areas of acute cortical infarction.  
There is no evidence of tumour invasion of the renal vein or its branches.  The kidney away from the tumour and areas of infarction appears essentially normal and the adrenal gland also shows no abnormality.  

DIAGNOSIS:
Right kidney:  
-  Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 2, size 105 x 85 x 65mm with preoperative embolisation.  
-  No evidence of invasion of the renal vein, no invasion of the renal capsule.  
-  Surgical margins well clear of tumour.
