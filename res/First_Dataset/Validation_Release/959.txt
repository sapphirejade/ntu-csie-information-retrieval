CLINICAL:
Possible pelvic mass - nil seen intra op.  Bilateral breast cancer.  Endometriosis.  Likely BRCA or similar.  Please section entire tubes.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 118g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 36 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium measures 1mm, myometrium measures up to 25mm.  The myometrium contains a submucosal fibroid measuring 15mm in maximum diameter.The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 4mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 4mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 10 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  A cystic lesion measuring 8mm in maximum extent is noted at the lower segment of body/upper aspect of endocervix.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (6 - with cystic lesion; 7 - with fibroids); 9 & 10 - TS right fallopian tube and LS of fimbriae; 11 to 13 - right ovary; 14 & 15 - TS ofleft fallopian tube and LS of fimbriae; 16 to 18 - left ovary; 19 & 20 - ?endometrium.  Please note entire fallopian tube and ovaries embedded.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 100 x 40 x 40mm.  Serosal surface and cut surface are unremarkable.  Multiple pieces in 3 blocks.  (WZ/rt 28.4.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Vonsoosten):
A.  Both ovaries and tubes have been examined in their entirety.  The right ovary shows a small focus of endometriosis on the surface.  Otherwise the ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.  The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium appears inactive.  A submucosal leiomyoma is present.
B.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Uterus, cervix, ovaries, tubes and omentum:  Submucosal leiomyoma, focal endometriosis.
