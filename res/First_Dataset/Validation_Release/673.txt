CLINICAL:
Left renal tumour.  Left renal mass.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left kidney" consists of a kidney incompletely covered with perinephric fat measuring 180 x 130 x 70mm and weighing 765g. There is an attached ureter which measures 110mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm. On sectioning the kidney itself measures 110 x 65 x 60mm. There is a well circumscribed mass located in the lower pole which measures 60 x 50 x 50 mm.  The mass has a dark red cut surface with multiple cystic spaces ranging from 1 to 4mm.  The mass appears to abut but not penetrate the renal capsule. 
Blocks:  1 - ureteric margin; 2 - vascular margins; 3 & 4 - sections of tumour closest to capsule; 5 to 8 - representative tumour (5 - reserved block); 9 - renal pelvis; 10 to 12 - representative uninvolved kidney.  (TO: PC; HA/rt 16.12.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof I Bonnenfant):
Sections show a well circumscribed 60mm tumour consistent with a renal oncocytoma. The tumour is composed of relatively monomorphic cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests, tubules and lining cystic spaces. Mitoses are not prominent.In some areas the rounded tumour cell nests are surrounded by loose myxoid stroma. 
The tumour abuts but does not invade the renal capsule. 
The ureteric and vascular resection margins are clear.
The surrounding renal parenchyma shows patchy mild chronic interstitial inflammation and scattered sclerosed glomeruli, particularly around the edge of the tumour, possibly reflecting local compressive changes. Elsewhere the renal parenchyma appears unremarkable.
The tumour is negative for Hale's colloidal iron staining. Immunoperoxidase staining is positive for CD117 and negative for CD10, CK7 and vimentin.
These features are consistent with a renal oncocytoma. Dr Richard Jin has also seen this case and agrees with this diagnosis.
DIANGOSIS:
