CLINICAL:
34 P4 HSIL pap smear 2061 - nil F/U.  Cervical cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix and right tube" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and right fallopian tube weighing in total 162g.  The uterus measures 105 x 60 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 50 x 45mm and has an unremarkable mucosal surface.  In the junction of ecto and endocervix there is a ragged area measuring 10mm from proximal to distal and seen in the anterior cervix.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 20mm.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness.  On sectioning the myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube and fimbria measures 100mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  There is a paratubal cyst 5mm in maximum diameter.  Specimen is sampled according to the attached diagram.  
Blocks: 1 to 10 - LS of anterior cervix; 11 - TS of endocervix; 12 to 15 - one LS anterior endocervix and body; 16 to 28 - serial LSof posterior cervix; 29 - TS endocervix; 30 to 33 - one full LS of posterior endocervix and body; 34 - two LS right fimbria; 35 - two TSright fallopian tube.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube" consists of a fallopian tube and fimbria measuring 50mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - two LS fimbria; 2 - two TS fallopian tube.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50 x 30 x 10mm containing four lymph nodes 10 to 15mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - two lymph nodes.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 30 x 5mm containing two lymph nodes 10 and 15mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one bisected lymph node each; 3 - fatty tissue.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 30 x 10mm containing two large lymph nodes 25 and 30mm in maximum diameter and a small lymph node 5mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 & 3 - one bisected lymph node; 4 - one lymph node.  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 10mm containing five lymph nodes ranging from 10 to 50mm in maximum diameter. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - largest lymph node; 3 - four lymph nodes.
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 5 and 10mm.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node each; 3 - rest of fatty tissue.
  
H.Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 10 x 5mm containing three lymph nodes measuring 5 to 10mm.  
Blocks: 1 -& 2 - one lymph node each; 3 - one lymph node with the rest of the fatty tissue.  (GG/ta 3/1/64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Mccawley): 
A.  Sections show well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma predominantly involving the anterior cervix.  The tumour has a depth of invasion of 3.8mm through a wall 8.8mm thick, a length of 14mm and an estimated width of 18mm.  Carcinoma is clear of the vaginal margin by 13mm.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
High grade CIN is also present.  This is clear of the vaginal margin.  No AIS is seen.
The endometrium is proliferative.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right tube is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show an unremarkable fallopian tube.  There is no evidence ofmalignancy.
C.Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, depth 3.8mm through a wall 8.8mm thick, length 14mm, estimated width 18mm.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Twenty (20) lymph nodes are negative.
