CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 245g in total.  The uterus measures 120 x 90 x 58mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is focally thickened up to 10mm (?tumour).  The endometrial tumour measures roughly 40 x 30 x 10mm.  The myometrium is 29mm in maximum thickness.  The right ovary measures 42 x 20 x 20mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 70mm in length and focally dilated up to 25mm.  The left ovary measures 35 x 22 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 85mm in length and is focally dilated up to 30mm.  The fimbrial ends of the two fallopian tubes are not identified.  
Blocks:  1 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix (5&6 - paired); 7 to 12 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix (9&10- paired, 11&12- paired); 13 to 16 - sections of posterior endomyometrium (13-reserved block for tumour bank); 17 - representative right ovary; 18 & 19 - representative right fallopian tube; 20 -representative left ovary; 21 & 22 - representative left fallopian tube.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Y Al-mansour) 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 8mm through a wall 23mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.  Both tubes show a hydrosalpinx.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 8mm through a wall 23mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.
