CLINICAL:
Cervical cancer.  Hypertension.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus withattached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 102g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 55 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an ulcerative tumour involving the anterior and posterior cervix measuring 40 x 10mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in lengthand 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 4mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Anterior cervix is inked blue, posterior black.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - shave of the vaginal cuff margin (1 - right side; 2 - left side); 3 to 10 - Serial LS of the anterior cervix arranged from right to left; 11 to 13 anterior uterus; 14 - representative section of lower segment of anterior uterus; 15 to 24 - consecutive LS of the posterior cervix arranged from right to left; 25 to 27 - LS of posterior uterus; 28 - LS oflower segment of posterior uterus; 29 - TS of right ovary and fallopian tube; 30 - TS left ovary and fallopian tube. Please note all cervical tissue embedded.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 55 x 30 x 20mm.  Three lymph nodes measuring 25, 20 and 2mm in maximal extent noted.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - single node; 3 & 4 - single node; 5 - smallest node.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 50 x 40 x 20mm.  Four lymph nodes measuring 15 x 10 x 8mm, 20 x 3 x 3mm and 8, 6mm in maximal extent noted.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - largest node; 3 - remainder three nodes.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 40 x 40 x 20mm.  Eight lymph nodes measuring 3 to 10mm in maximum extent are identified.  
Blocks: 1  - largest node bisected ; 2 - threenodes; 3 - four nodes.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 40 x 50 x 30mm.  Four lymph nodes measuring 3 to 8mm in maximumextent are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - two nodes; 2 - two nodes.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 10 x 8 x 3mm containing a lymph node measuring 6mm in maximal extent.AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 20 x 15 x 5mm.  A lymph node measuring 6mm in maximum extent are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph node; 2 - probable vascular structures. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Left vaginal angle" consists of two pieces of unorientated tissue measuring 25 x 10 x 3mm, 15 x 6 x 3mm.  Deep surfaces of both pieces is inked blue.  TS.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - TS larger piece (1 & 4) TS of the ends (2 & 3 - TS mid); 5 to 7 - TS smaller fragments (5 & 7 - TS ends; 6 - TS mid portion) AE.  
I.  Specimen labelled "Parametrial tissue" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 10 x 6 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.   (KJ/ta 29/4/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Pearson): 
A.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the entire cervix.  The tumour involves the full thickness of the cervical wall 10mm through 10mm, and has paracervical and parametrial soft tissue involvement.  The maximum tumour length is 43mm.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is present.  No perineural invasion is seen.
One paracervical lymph node shows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
Carcinoma extends to within 1.5mm of the vaginal margin posteriorly and 3mm anteriorly.  
CIN 3 is present but there is no AIS.
The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium and both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  One of three lymph nodes shows metastatic squamous cellcarcinoma.  No extracapsular invasion is seen.
C.  One of four lymph nodes shows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular invasion is seen.
D.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Sections show unremarkable vagina.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
I.  There is noevidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma ofthe cervix, depth 10mm through a wall 10mm thick, length 43mm.  Paracervical and parametrial soft tissue involvement is present.  Three of twenty five (3 of 25) lymph nodes show metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
