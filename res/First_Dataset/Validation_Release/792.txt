DR JEROMY STACEY Mac-DIAMICO
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY

CLINICAL:
Left breast DCIS.  Left axilla sentinel node biopsy.  Left 8 to 10 o'clock DCIS.  Skin sparing mastectomy.  Short superior, long lateral sutures.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Left axilla sentinel node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes 15 and 20mm in maximum dimension.  Imprints done for cytology.
Blocks:  1 - lymph node one; 2 - lymph node two.
IMPRINTS REPORT:
No malignant cells seen in each lymph node.
Result to Dr Louge via anaesthetist by Dr Garret at 0933 on the 24/1/14.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast suture - long lateral, short superior" consists of a mastectomy measuring 170mm (medial to lateral) x 160mm (superior to inferior) x 45mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of skin on the surface measuring 65 x 28mm which includes a nipple-areolar complex.  The skin appears unremarkable.  There is an area of sclerosis with small calcifications at 8 to 10 o'clock approximately 65mm from the nipple.  This area extends inferiorly over an area of 4mm.  The outer lower quadrant has diffuse sclerotic areas over 40 x 40 x 30mm however no distinct lesion is identified.  The rest of the breast tissue appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 - nipple-areolar complex; 2 to 6 - composite blocks (block 2 superior margin and DCIS; 3 to 6 - DCIS from superior to inferior); 7 to 14 - composite blocks (block 7 - DCIS from medial to lateral); 15 to 18 - area of sclerosis at the lower outer quadrant; 19 & 20 - upper outer quadrant; 21 & 22 - upper inner quadrant; 23 & 24 - lower inner quadrant.  Please see diagram.  (TO: XN; SY/rt 30.3.64)
