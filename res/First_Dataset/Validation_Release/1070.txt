CLINICAL:
Stage 2B cervical cancer 2061 -treated with chemoradiation.  Subtotal hysterectomy for haematometra.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterine corpus" consists of a uterus with attached right fallopian tube and right ovary weighing 308g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 95 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm.  The cervix is distorted and the os is stenotic.  On sectioning, the endometrium is thickened with a nodular mass in the posterior left wall.  There are also multiple pale nodular projections on the endometrium of the anterior and posterior body of the uterus.  The endometrium is 3mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 30mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium appears unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 46mm in length x 5mmin maximum dimension.  The right ovary is 25 x 20 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 - left anterior cervix; 6 to 8 - right anterior cervix; 9 - area of endometrial thickening on anterior body; 10 to 14 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 15 to 18 - right posterior cervix; 19 to 23 - left posterior cervix; 24 - thickened endometrium onleft posterior body; 25 to 27 - right ovary AE; 28 - right fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left fallopian tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube 35mm long and 8mm in diameter, and an ovary 30 x 21 x 8mm.  Thereis an exophytic growth on the external surface of the fallopian tube at the fimbrial end; this measures 15 x 15 x 6mm.  The ovary measures 30 x 21 x 8mm.  There is a grey-tan piece of tissue 15 x 5 x 5mm adherent to one aspect of the ovary.
AE four blocks.  Blocks:  1 & 2 - ovary AE; 3 & 4 - fallopian tube.   (JL/cc  23/5/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Shoen): 
A.  Sections of the cervix show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of endocervical-type.  The tumour partly has a papillary and glandular architecture but there is also a significant poorly differentiated component, consisting of trabeculae of cells with large nuclei, abundant cytoplasm and showing minimal gland formation.  Tumour involves the full circumference of the cervix and invades deeply into cervical stroma, and also extensively involves endometrium and invades into myometrium.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion measures 10mm out of total stromal thickness of 14mm.   Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is measured at 12mm where total myometrial thickness is 16mm (block A24).  There is lymphovascular invasion at least focally in the myometrium (block A15).  Part of the tumour invading myometrium has a mucinous (colloid) appearance.  
Tumour cells involving the surface lining of thecervix, and also focal invasive carcinoma (block A6), extend to the ectocervical excision margin.  No squamous epithelium is seen on the ectocervix or at the ectocervical margin.  
A cellular leiomyoma and adenomyosis are also noted in the myometrium.  
Sections of the right fallopian tube show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma at the fimbrial end.  Sections of the right ovary show deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the serosal surface and focally within the ovary.  
B.  Sections of the fallopian tube show focal involvement of the tube lining by adenocarcinoma of endocervical-type.  The described exophytic mass on the external surface of the tube is a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Sections of left ovary show focal deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the serosal surface.  The described tissue attached to one aspect of the ovary is a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma.    
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, right ovary and tube:  
-  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of endocervical-type involving cervix, endometrium and myometrium. 
-  Metastases to right ovary and fimbrial end of right tube.  
B.  Leftovary and fallopian tube:
-  Metastatic adenocarcinoma involving fallopian tube and ovary.
