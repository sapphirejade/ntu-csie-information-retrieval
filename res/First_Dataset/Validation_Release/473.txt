(R) Pelvic mass for frozen section - right ovarian cyst
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovarian cyst" consists of a cysticmass measuring 50 x 30 x 30mm.  The capsule appears disrupted in one area.  On sectioning it has a variegated appearance with cystic areas filled with creamy yellow material and solid areas.  Two representative sections for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 and 2- frozen section; 3 to 10- rest of frozen section (approximately 90% of the tumour is embedded.)
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Large cell malignancy favour poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Phone results to fellow at 4:25pm on 4/6/2013 by Dr. D. Roya and Dr. D. Reitmeyer.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of multiple pieces of omentum measuring in aggregate 90 x 50 x 20mm.  The section is serially sectioned.  There is ot evidence of tumour.  Representative sections in 3 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum " consists of multiple pieces of omentum measuring in aggregate 110 x 60 40mm.  The specimen is serially sectioned, no tumour is identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue containing five lymph nodes measuring 5 to 50mm in maximum diameter. 
Blocks: 1 -three lymph nodes; 2 and 3- one lymph node; 4 to 6- one lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue containing eight lymph nodes measuring 10 to 35mm in maximum diameter.
Blocks: 1-four lymph nodes; 2- three lymph nodes; 3 and 4- one lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic side wall peritoneum " consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x 20 x 2mm.  AE 1 block. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 20 x 20 x 2mm.  AE 1 block. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvicside wall peritoneum" consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue 15mm in maximum diameter.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Buergel):
A.  Sections of ovary show a poorly differentiated carcinoma with solid sheet-like/syncytial growth pattern.  Possible glandular formations and papillary architecture are focally present.  The tumour cells show high grade nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Large areas of necrosis and haemorrhage are present.  The tumour cells are positive for p53, CA125, MNF-116, CK7, EMA and ER.  The stains for PR and CK20 are negative.  The appearances are consistent with those of poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.  No definite fallopian tube tissue is seen.  Foci of endometriosis are seen within the surrounding tissue.
B & C.  Sections show normal appearing adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Five (5) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable except a small benign haemangioma.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
E.  Eight (8) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
F to H.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
The case is shown to Dr D Chasten.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right ovarian cyst - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
B & C.  Omentum - No significant abnormality.
D.  Right external iliac lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/5).
E.  Right obturator lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/8).
F to H.  Multiple peritoneal biopsies - No significant abnormality.
