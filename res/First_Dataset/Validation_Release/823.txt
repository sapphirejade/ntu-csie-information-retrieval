CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer(grade 1 - 2 endometrioid on D & C) - total laparoscopic hysterectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 127g.  The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 40mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 3mm in maximum diameter with a polypoid appearance.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 25mm.  The right fallopian tube and fimbria is 60 x 5 x 5mm and macroscopically appears unremarkable.  The right ovary is 25 x 15 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube and fimbria is 65 x 5 x 5 and appears unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - one full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - representative sections of anterior endomyometrium; 7 to 10 - one full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - two representative sections of posterior endomyometrium; 13 - right cornu; 14 - left cornu; 15 - right parametrial tissue; 16 - left parametrial tissue; 17 -two LS of right fimbria and one TS of right fallopian tube; 18 - one representative section of right ovary; 19 - two LS left fimbria and fallopian tube; 20 - one representative section of the left ovary.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Luchini):
Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  There is no convincing myometrial invasion.  There is no lymphvascular invasion.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instabilityphenotype.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
