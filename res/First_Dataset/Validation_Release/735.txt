Endometrial cancer. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 91g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 40 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  On opening there is an area in the posterior endometrium measuring 7 x 6mm which appears roughened.  Underlying this area there is a cream area in the myometrium invading 5mm over a total wall thickness 20mm.  Otherwise the endometrium appears unremarkable.  The myometrium also appears unremarkable throughout.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm. There is a cystic mass replacing the right ovary measuring 36 x 32 x 28mm.  The inner cyst lining appears smooth and unremarkable. The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm. The left ovary measures 26 x 16 x 13mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Block 1-3 - full LS of posterior body and uterus; 4-6 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 7 - further posterior endometrium; 8 - further anterior endometrium; 9 - right tube; 10-12 - right ovarian cyst and ? ovary; 13 - left tube; 14 - left ovary. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 60mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 4-20mm.  Block 1 & 2 - lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5-22mm.  Block 1- lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - onelymph node bisected. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm.  One lymph node 23mm is identified.Block 1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - remainder of tissue AE. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 28mm.  One lymph node 25mm is identified.  Serially sectioned, AE 1 block. 
F.   Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 65mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5-25mm.  Block 1 & 2- lymph nodes; 3 -one lymph node serially sectioned. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 25 and 55mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5-20mm. 
Block 1- lymph nodes; 2 & 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omental tissue measuring 280 x 100 x 15mm.  No suspicious areas are identified. Representative sections in 3 blocks.(JM/ec 14.4.64) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Borodec) 
A.  Sections of uterus show a serous adenocarcinoma (grade 3).  The carcinoma shows a mixture of papillary and solid architecture.  The carcinoma shows superficial myometrial invasion (inner half) and the depth of invasion is3mm (block A7).  The myometrium is 19mm in thickness.  The endocervix and cervix are unremarkable.  There is focal lymphovascular invasion within outer half of the myometrium (block A2).  The rest of endometrium is atrophic and shows no significant abnormality.  Thereis focal adenomyosis.  The uterine serosa is unremarkable.  Small fragments of serous adenocarcinoma are present within the lumens of both fallopian tubes.  The rest of fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  The right ovarian cyst is a simple cyst and the cyst lining is completely denuded.  The left ovary shows multiple foci of metastatic serous adenocarcinoma measuring up to 3mm in diameter.  All the tumour metastases are on the outer surface of left ovary.
B.  Ten (10) lymph nodes areidentified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Six (6) lymph nodes are identified.  1 of 6 lymph nodes is involved by metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.  No extranodal spread is seen.
D.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Five (5) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Four (4) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.There is no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Sections show small foci of metastatic serous adenocarcinoma on the surface of omentum.  
Representative slides are shown to Dr X Stelle.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries 
- Serous adenocarcinoma (uterine primary);
- Fragments of serous adenocarcinoma within the lumens of both fallopian tubes;
- Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma involving left ovary.
B to G.  Multiple pelvic lymph nodes - Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma involving 1 of 27 lymph nodes (left obturator lymph node, specimen C).
H.  Omentum -Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.
