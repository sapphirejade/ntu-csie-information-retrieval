CLINICAL:
Right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer.  HTN.  Depression, high cholesterol.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of bowel comprising of terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon.  The terminal ileum measures 100mm in length and is unremarkable.  The attached appendix measures 85mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  The appendix is unremarkable.  The caecum and ascending colon measure 125mm in total length.  85mm from the distal resection margin,there is a sessile ulcerated tumour measuring 45 x 30mm.  The tumour involves 75% of the bowel circumference.  The tumour invades through the full thickness of muscularis propria and abuts the peritoneum.  One small 4mm polyp is identified just proximal to the tumour.  Numerous lymph nodes are identified measuring from 1mm to 8mm.  
Blocks: 1 - resection margins; 2 - tumour to deepest point invasion; 3 - reserve block;  4 to 6 - representative tumour; 7 - tumour to normal mucosa; 8 - polyp; 9 normal mucosa; 10 - representative appendix; 11 - apical node; 12 & 13 - lymph nodes; 14 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 15 & 16 - lymph nodes.

Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  85mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not applicable
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  16
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1
pN1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Not seen
Perineural invasion
Not seen
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
- One small tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia is present.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Notapplicable
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining/
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining ofa carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
