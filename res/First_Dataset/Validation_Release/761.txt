FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
A to C:  No evidenceof malignancy.
Result to Dr Reglin by Dr JEROME Hua at 12:53 on 25.2.2014.
D.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, weighing 93g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 45 x 47mmand shows focal ulceration.  On sectioning the endometrium measures 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium measures 16mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Cut surface of the cervix shows tumour invasive and measures 13mm in maximum depth.
Blocks:  1 to 13 - eight LS slices of anterior cervix arranged from right to left (five slices on the left side bisected arranged from superior to inferior); 14 & 15 - LS of anterior uterus bisected; 16 to 35 - twelve slices of the posterior cervix arranged from left to right (mid eight slices bisected arranged from superior to inferior); 36 & 37 - LS of posterior uterus bisected (all cervical tissue embedded).  Multiple pieces in 37 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of apiece of fatty tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 8mm containing a lymph node measuring 7 x 8 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 15 x 10mmcontaining four lymph nodes measuring 10, 8, 5 and 5mm.
Blocks:  1 - single node; 2 - single node; 3 - two nodes.  Multiple pieces in 3 blocks.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 25 x 30 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes measuring 15 x 8 x 3mm and 3mm identified.
Blocks:  1 - larger lymph node; 2 - smaller lymph node.  Multiple pieces in 2 blocks.
H.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 8mm.  Three lymph nodes measuring 20 x 10 x 3mm, 8 and 2mm identified.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - largest lymph node; 3 - two nodes.  Multiple pieces in 3 blocks.
I.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes measuring 25 x 6 x 6mm and 10 x 3 x 3mm identified.
Blocks:  1 - larger node; 2 - smaller node.  Multiple pieces in 2 blocks.
J.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 10 x 10mm containing a fatty lymph node measuring 40 x 6 x 6mm.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph node.  Multiple pieces in 2 blocks.
K.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral vaginal cuff stitch at proximal" consists of a piece of tissue with stitch marking proximal measuring 50 x 15 x 10mm.  Proximal margin inked black, new distal margin inked blue. Specimen sectioned from posterior to anterior into sixteen slices, slice one most posterior, slice sixteen most anterior.
Blocks:  1 - LS of slice one; 2 to 15 - radial section arranged from posterior to anterior; 16 - LSof slice sixteen.  AE in 16 blocks.  (TO: MK; AN/rt 28.4.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Merna):
A. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
B.Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with circumferential involvement of the cervix.  The lesion involves the full thickness of the cervix to abut the serosa (18mm into a wall 18mm thick).  There is noevidence of surface serosal involvement.
There is invasion into the left parametrium (D18).
Two foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen (D21, 26)
The invasive tumour is 5 mm from the nearest left posterior deep cervical margin (D17), and is 8 mm from the anterior endocervical margin.
The adjacent cervical squamous epitheliumshows CIN3, which involves the right lateral ectocervical margin (D31).
Complex hyperplasia without atypia, with squamous morules, is present in the endometrium.
SUMMARY
Site: Cervix with circumferential involvement
Lesion: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
Greatest dimension: 37mm (along endocervical canal, microscopic)
Depth of invasion: 18mm into a wall 18mm thick
Parametrium: involved (Left side, D18)
Lymphovascular invasion: present (2 foci, D21, 26)
Margins invasive cancer:
 Deep cervical: 5mm (left posterior, D17)
 Ectocervical: 8mm (anterior)
Margins CIN3: Positive (right lateral, D31)
Other pathology: Complex hyperplasia without atypia, with squamous morules, is present in the endometrium.  There is no evidence of invasion.
Shown to Dr Deetta TAMARGO.
E. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
F. Sections show 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
H. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
I. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
J. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
K. Sections show VAIN3 at the proximal aspect of the specimen (contiguous with CIN3 in the main specimen). The lesion is 8mm from thenew distal margin.
