CLINICAL:
Right upper lobe Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right upper lobe" consists of a large and deformed right upper lobe measuring 130mm (anterior to posterior), 100mm (medial to lateral) and 110mm (superior to inferior).  In the superior aspect of the lobe there is a large tumour which appears to have breached the pleural surface.  On sectioning the parenchyma is almost totally replaced by a well circumscribed necrotic tumour measuring110 x 100 x 100mm.  The tumour is white with necrotic areas and haemorrhage.  It is located 15mm from the bronchial margin.  
Blocks:  1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 -  peribronchial lymph nodes; 4 - tumour close to thebronchial margin; 5 to 9 - tumour (block 9 - selected for tissue banking); 10 - non-tumoural lung; reselect blocks 11-16 - representative sections from the tumour close to the ragged area; 17 & 18 - tumour selected for tissue bank.
B.  Specimen labelled "Paratracheal lymph node" consists of a black node, 20 x 10 x 10mm.  The specimen is BAE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Tracheal bronchial lymph node" consists of one black node, 15 x 10 x 10mm.  The specimen is BAE 1 block.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Parietal pleura" consists of a piece of pleura, 70 x 20 x 2mm.  Macroscopically it is unremarkable.  The specimen is serially sectioned and AE 3 blocks.  (KR/mm 27.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Behanna):
A.  Sections show large cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe with extensive areas of necrosis.  No definite glandular or squamous differentiation is seen and the CK5/6 and p63 stains are negative.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  The tumour measures 110mm across and liesgreater than 10mm from the bronchial resection margin.  The bronchial resection margin is free of tumour.  The tumour breaches the elastic layer of the visceral pleural over a broad front, where there is adherent parietal pleura.  Nine (9) hilar lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.  The remaining lung parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.
B.  The six (6) paratracheal lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.  
C.  The single (1)tracheobronchial lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.  
D.  Sections show parietal pleura in which small deposits of tumour cells are seen within surface fibrinous adhesions.  No invasion into fibroadipose tissue is seen.  

DIAGNOSIS:  
A - D.  Right upper lobe and lymph nodes:
-  Large cell carcinoma, size 110mm.
-  Bronchial resection margin clear of tumour
- Tumour breaches visceral pleura.
- Tumour present on surface of parietal pleura.
-  Sixteen (16) negative lymph nodes.
-  Stage T3N0MX
