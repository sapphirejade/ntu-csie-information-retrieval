CLINICAL:
Carcinoma of the prostate Gleason 3+4.  Radical proctectomy  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate" consists of a prostate measuring 55 x 45 x 30mm and weighing 37.5g.  The right vas deferens measures 25 x 5 x 5mm.  The left vas deferens measures 26 x 6 x 7mm, the right seminal vesicle measures 35 x 12 x 6mm, the left seminal vesicle measures 28 x 10 x 6mm.  The left half is inked blue and the right black with the anterior green.  The prostate is transversally sectioned into four slices.  Slice one (apex) and slice four (base) are further parasagittally sectioned.Specimen AE. 
Blocks: 1 to 8 - (apex from right to left) slice one; 9 & 10 - slice two; 11 & 12 - slice three; 13 to 21 - slice four (base from right to left); 22 & 23 - right seminal vesicle; 24 - right vas deferens; 25 - left vas deferens;26 - left seminal vesicle.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymphnodes" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 43 x 21 x 10mm.  There is one lymph node identified measuring 40 x 9 x 9mm.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.
  
C.  Specimen labelled"Left pelvic lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 9mm.  There is one lymph node identified measuring 35 x 10 x 5mm.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 3 blocks.  (WF/ta 6/1/63)

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Bucklew - 7.4.2063)
A.  Sections of prostate show prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for prostate adenocarcinoma follows:
Histological type: Prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma.
Tumour location:
Dominant nodule: 	Right posterolateral mid prostate.
	Non-dominant: Left anterolateral apex and left base.
Volume/Size:	0.41ml (14mm x 11mm x 6.6mm x 0.0004) 
Gleason score = 3 +4 = 7.

Extraprostatic extension: 
There is no evidence of extraprostatic extension.
Surgical margins:
Left lateral: Tumour is present in the left lateral end block at the base, but no definite margin involvement is seen in multiple levels examined (A21).
Right lateral: 0.56mm (A9).
Superior (base): 1.5mm (A21).
Inferior (apex): 1.6mm (A7).
Anterior margin:  1.6mm (A7).
Posterior: 2.2mm (A9).
Perineural invasion: 
Present (multifocal).

Seminal vesicles: 
The right and left seminal vesicles show no evidence of malignancy.
Lymphovascular invasion (LVSI): No definite LVSI is seen. 
Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: Present (multifocal). 

Lymph nodes:
Right pelvic lymph node (specimen B): No evidence of malignancy in one lymph node (0/1).
Left pelvic lymph node (specimen C): No evidence of malignancy in one lymph node (0/1).

Stage (AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition): STAGE IIB
pT2c Carcinoma involves both lobes of prostate (bilateral disease).
pNo No evidence of lymph node metastasis. 
pMx Cannot beassessed histologically.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Prostate and right and left pelvic lymph nodes:
Prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, pTNM stage IIC.
There is multifocal perineural invasion and no evidence of extraprostatic spread or seminal vesicle involvement 
Tumour is focally close to the margins, but no definite margin involvement is seen.
No evidence of malignancy in right and left pelvic lymph nodes (0/2).
