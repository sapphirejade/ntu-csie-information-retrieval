CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma of the endometrium.  Uterus/cervix/ovaries/tubes.  Left obturator nodes.  Left ext iliac nodes.  Right obturator nodes.  Rightext iliac nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 229g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 95 x 60mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On opening the uterus the cavity is filled with a soft cream and yellow tumour measuring 90 x 80 x 55mm.  The tumour is arising from the posterior endometrium with apparent inner half myometrial invasion.  The cut surface of the mass has a variegated cream/yellow/grey and haemorrhagic surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  A paratubal cyst is present which measures 20 x 20 x 15mm.  The cyst has a thin transparent wall and is uniloculated.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 25mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 10 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section through anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full longitudinalsection through posterior body and cervix; 9 to 18 - representative tumour; 19 - representative right fallopian tube; 20 - right paratubal cyst; 21 - representative right ovary; 22 - representative left fallopian tube; 23 - representativeleft ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes" consists of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes" consists of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 25 x 8mm.
Blocks:  1 - onelymph node bisected; 2 - remaining tissue.  AE.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists offatty tissue measuring 45 x 20 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  AE 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Teters):
A.  Sections show a very large carcinosarcoma / MMMT.  The tumour is approximately 70% sarcoma (with heterologous elements in the form of rhabdomyoblasts) and 30% carcinoma (mostly grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The squamous component of theendometrioid adenocarcinoma appears focally cytologically malignant).  The depth of invasion is difficult to measure as the tumour is very exophytic, however I feel it is approximately 4mm through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Six lymph nodes show no evidenceof malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Carcinosarcoma / Malignant mixed Mullerian tumour of the endometrium, depth 4mm through a wall 12mm thick.  Cervix uninvolved.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Twenty two (22) lymph nodes are negative.
