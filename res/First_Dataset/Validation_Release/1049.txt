CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma of the endometrium on curettings.
:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes, bilateral ovaries and cervix" consists of a bulky and multinodular uterus with cervix  and bilateral adnexae attached .  The specimen weighs 380g.  The uterus measures 120 x 100 x 70mm.  The external surface is multinodular and haemorrhagic.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm.  The cervical mucosa is shiny with multiple haemorrhagic petechia.  On sectioning the endometrial cavity is totally occupied by a fleshy and polypoid tan mass measuring 50 x 20 x 20mm.  The endometrium has a maximum thickness of 1mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 30mm.  On sectioning the myometrium is fleshy with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The right fallopian tube measures 70 x 5 x 5mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  Theright ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  The cut surface is unremarkable.  The left tube measures 70mm in length and up to 4mm in maximum diameter.  The external surface is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 30 x 20 x 10mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 to 9 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 10 to 14 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 15 to 17 - threerepresentative sections of the cervix; 18 to 23 - six representative sections of endomyometrium; 24 & 25 - polypoid tissue in the endometrial cavity; 26 - two LS right fimbria and one TS fallopian tube; 27 - one LS fimbria; 28 - one TS right ovary; 29 - two LS left fimbria; 30 - one TS left ovary and TS fallopian tube (block 25 - tissue for tissue banking).
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of two nodules measuring 50 x 20 x 20mm and 20 x 10 x 10mm.  On sectioning they are replaced by tumour.  Blocks:  1 - one representative section of the biggest nodule; 2 - smallest nodule bisected.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a necroticnodule measuring 60 x 30 x 20mm.  The cut surface is fleshy and necrotic.  Two representative sections in 2 blocks.  (P/bl 23/8/62)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Lovett):
A.  Sections show a high grade malignancy involving virtually the entire uterus.  The tumour is composed of large cells with prominentnucleoli and a small amount of dense cytoplasm.  Focally the tumour has a spindled sarcomatous morphology where it is infiltrating the endometrium inbetween the glands.  Most of the tumour in the myometrium is arranged in large nodules and invasive tongues.  The cells are positive for Vimentin, focally positive for CD10, and negative for CAM5.2, AE1/3, LCA, HMB45, Melan A and SMA.  Also focally, the cells have a rhabdomyosarcomatous appearance with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (these cells are strongly positive for Desmin and Myogenin).  There is full thickness myometrial invasion (30mm through 30mm) with extension onto the serosal surface, focal endometrial involvement and ectocervical and endocervical stromal involvement.  Anteriorly the tumour reaches the vaginal margin.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is seen in the myometrium and cervix.
The ovaries and tubes are uninvolved.
B.  Two lymph nodes show extensive metastatic malignancy with extracapsular spread.
C.  One lymph node shows extensivemetastatic malignancy with necrosis and extracapsular spread.
COMMENT:
The tumour is a high grade sarcoma, with focal morphological and immunohistochemical features suggesting an undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade sarcoma extensively involving the uterus with full thickness myometrial invasion and ectocervicaland endocervical stromal involvement.  Extensive myometrial and cervical lymphvascular invasion is present.  Three lymph nodes are positive.  SEE COMMENT.
