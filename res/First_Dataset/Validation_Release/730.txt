CLINICAL:
SCC vulva.  Anterior vulvectomy.  LND. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulvectomy and distal urethra stitch anterior", consists of an anterior vulvectomy with one stitch anterior and measuring 105mm anterior to posterior and 65mm right to left.  On the surface ofthe skin there is a blue dye area with a ragged surgical scar measuring 35mm from anterior to posterior and up to 5mm from right to left. The urethra is 5 x 4mm.  The scar is located 10mm from the posterior margin and 70mm from the anterior margin.  The left margin is inked blue, right margin black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior margin into seventeen slices.  Slice 1 - anterior margin, 17 - posterior margin. Representative sections are taken according to the diagram:  Block 1 - 1LS anterior margin (slice 1); 2 & 3 - slice 4; 4 & 5 - slice 8; 6 & 7 - slice 11; 8 & 9 - slice 12; 10 & 11 - slice 13; 12 & 13 - slice 14; 14 & 15 - slice 15; 16 & 17 - slice 16; 18-29 - slice 17 (posterior margin).
B.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral inguinal lymph node", consists of a piece of adipose tissue 40 x 25 x 20mm.  Five possible lymph nodes areidentified ranging from 2-20mm.  Block 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - ? three lymph nodes; 3 - one bisected lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal lymph node", consists of a piece of adipose tissue 30 x 15 x 15mm.  Five lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 - 20mm.  Block 1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - two lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left medial lymph node", consists of two pieces of adipose tissue measuring in aggregate 50 x 40 x 30mm.  Seven lymph nodes are identifiedranging from 2-15mm.  Blocks 1-5 - one bisected lymph node each; 6 - two lymph nodes.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral inguinal lymph node", consists of a piece of adipose tissue 30 x 20 x 10mm with three lymph nodes ranging from 5-17mm. 
Blocks 1 & 2 - one bisected lymph node each; 3 - one lymph node
F.  Specimen labelled "Left femoral lymph node", consists of two pieces of adipose tissue 10 x 10 x 2mm and 15 x 10 x 2mm.  No lymph nodes identified. AE 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr W Brizeno): 
A.  Sections of vulval skin show a scar consistent with previous surgery.  No residual VIN or invasive tumour is identified.  The urethra shows no significant abnormality.  Changes of a lichen sclerosis are present.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B.  The five (5) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The five (5) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.  One of the lymph nodes contains a granuloma with a necrotic and partly calcified centre.  No fungi or acid fast bacilli are seen with special stains.  
D.  The seven (7) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.  
E.  The three (3) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.  
F.  No lymph nodes are identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - F.  Anterior vulvectomy and distal urethra, lymph nodes:
- Scar consistentwith previous surgery.
- No residual VIN or invasive malignancy. 
- Twenty negative lymph nodes.
- Features oflichen sclerosis.  
- Granuloma within right medial inguinal lymph node.
