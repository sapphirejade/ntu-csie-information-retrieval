MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by IU
A.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic mass node", consists of a solid tumour mass 40 x28 x 24mm withattached fat.  1 representative section for FS.  Block 1 - FS; 2-6 - rest of FS; 6 - tissue selected for tissue banking.
FROZEN SECTION:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with a gynae primary.
Result to Dr Ramjan by Dr S Schmunk at 16:20pm on 21.9.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of omentum 70 x 30 x 10mm. On sectioning it is unremarkable. Representative sections in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr S Schmucker)  
A.  Sections show a markedly enlarged lymph node with extensive involvement by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  There is some patchy tumour necrosis.  The tumour consists of sheets of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic cytoplasm.  The appearances are consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  No definite extranodal spread is seen.  Tumour may extend focally to aresection margin.  
B.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left pelvic mass/node:  Metastatic poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  
B.  Omental biopsy:  No tumour.
