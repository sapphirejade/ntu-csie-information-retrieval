CLINICAL:
Cervical cancer - SCC.  Bronchiectasis (since infancy). 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 71g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 72 x 50 x 25mm.  The ectocervix is 45 x 40mm.  The left fallopian tube is 55mm in length and the left ovary is 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube is 50mm in length and the right ovary is 35 x 15 x 8mm.  Both adnexae appear unremarkable.  There is attached left parametrium 20 x 15 x 10mm and right parametrium 50 x 15 x 10mm.  There is included anterior vaginal cuff, which has a brown haemorrhagic area over the midline anterior surface, 12 x 5mm.  The posterior vaginal wall cuff appears unremarkable.  There is an ulcerated tan tumour centred over the endocervical canal 25 x 16 x 20mm.  The tumour appears to infiltrate into the left parametrium and right parametrial soft tissues.  The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometrium is 14mm in thickness and appears unremarkable.  The anterior margin is inked blue and posterior black.
Blocks: 1 to 9 - anteriorcervix with vaginal cuff, serially embedded from left towards right; 10 to 16 - anterior upper cervix serially embedded from left towards right; 17 & 18 - loweruterine segment upper extent of tumour; 19 - shave margin posterior left vaginal cuff; 20 - shave margin posterior right vaginal cuff; 21 to 29 - posterior cervix serially embedded from left towards right; 30 - anterior endometrium; 31 - posterior and myometrium; 32 -left fallopian tube and ovary; 33 - right fallopian tube and ovary.

B.  Specimen labelled "2 Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue measuring 70 x 40 x 15mm and 50 x 15 x 8mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 25mm across.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - largest lymph node bisected; 3 - one lymph node bisected; 4 - multiple lymph nodes.  
C.  Specimen labelled "3 Right obturator lymph node " consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 70 x 50 x 20mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 40mm across.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - largest lymph node bisected; 3 - multiple lymph nodes.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "4 Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 6 and 15mm across.  
Blocks: 1 - two lymph nodes.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "5 Left obturator lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissued measuring 50 x 30 x 15mm and 25 x 15 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified upto 15mm across. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - two lymph nodes in each block.  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "6 Right common iliaclymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 25 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified measuring up to 15mm across.  
Blocks: 1 - multiple lymph nodes.  
    
G.  Specimen labelled "7 Left common iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 10mm in aggregate.Two possible lymph nodes are identified, measuring up to 5mm across.  
Blocks: 1 - two possible lymph nodes.   (QH/ta 22/4/64)  
  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Mais): 
A.  Sections show an extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.  The tumour extends through the full thickness of the cervicalwall (15mm through 15mm) and involves the left parametrial soft tissue.  The length of the tumour is 25mm.  Lymphatic and venous invasion are present as well as perineural invasion.  Carcinoma is clear of the vaginal cuff margin by 12mm.
VAIN 3 is present but this is clear of the vaginal cuff margin.  CIN 3 is present but there is no AIS.
The endometrium appears inactive.  The myometrium, ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  One of five lymph nodes shows a 0.2mm metastatsis of squamous cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
D.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One of four lymph nodes shows a 2mm deposit of squamous cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
F.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, depth of invasion 15mm through a wall 15mm thick, length 25mm.  Parametrial soft tissue involvement is present.  Lymphatic, venous and perineural invasion is present.Two of twenty (2 of 20) lymph nodes show metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
