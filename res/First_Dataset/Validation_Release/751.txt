HISTORY                    
3/52 port up right hemicolectomy for colon cancer; desmoplastic small round cell tumour. Subsequent CT - showed small mass in rectosigmoid. Re-laparotomy/peritonectomy. Portacaval lymph node. Post right hemicolectomy with pathology of desmoplastic small round cell tumour.
MACROSCOPIC              
A. "PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE". A lymph node measuring 10mm with three smaller nodes 5, 4 & 3mm. Smaller node, normal cut surface, largest node, normal cut surface, two TS large naval. Two TS largest node for frozen section.
F/S: "No involvement seen - reactive node" per phone to "Jacquet" at 10:15am on 25/2/14 by Dr. G. Hosseini.
(1 frozen section; 2 largest node; 3 second node bisected; 4 smallest nodes bisected). RS (M-4)
B. "ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS UMBILICUS, PELVIC STRIP". A length of bowel measuring 140mm in length with attached mesocolon to a length of 100mm. The bowel has an anastomosis which is 70mm from one margin, inked blue (likely small bowel) and 75mm from the opposite surgical margin (likely large bowel), inked black. On the serosal surface there is a fibrin and haemorrhage over much of a large bowel. On opening, the wall thickness is 4mm, the mucosa appears unremarkable in these small bowel and large bowel segment. The mesocolon also appears unremarkable. The mesocolon has dense, pale, yellow calcification within the fat. The calcification measures from 4-10mm in maximum dimension. Other ?lymph nodes are identified. Received with the specimenare strips of peritoneum with attached grey, tan nodule of tumour which range from 3-45mm in maximum dimension. The strips measures 95, 70, 65 and 20mm in length. There is also an umbilicus to the subcutaneous tissue which measures 20x20x20mm. The skin appears unremarkable and the underlying fibrofatty tissue is unremarkable. There is a separate piece of omentum measuring 200x100x15mm which is haemorrhagic and has firm, small nodular area within the fat. Three nodulesare identified measuring 3, 4 & 6mm each. The rest of the omentum is unremarkable.
(1 proximal surgical margin; 2 distal surgical margin, large bowel; 3 TS through bowel and adherent fibrinous mesocolon; 4 normal bowel; 5-8 ?lymph node within mesocolon; 9 TS through umbilicus; 10-13 tumour on peritoneum; 14 omentum nodule; 15 representative omentum). RS (M-15/MC/cy)
MICROSCOPIC      (Dr G Tarallo)            .  Four lymph nodes show reactive changes.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
B.  Sections through ileocolic anastomosis show foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material in keeping with previous surgery.  The rest of the colon and small bowel show no significant abnormality.  The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion.  
Sections through the umbilicus are also unremarkable.  
Sections through the omentum shows scattered reactive lymph nodes.  
Sections through the separately submitted peritoneal mass show a deposit of desmoplastic small round cell tumour similar to the previous resection our reference 21B01152.  
DIAGNOSIS             
PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE: -
- NO TUMOUR SEEN IN FOUR LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.
ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS, UMBILICUS AND PELVIC STRIP:
- PERITONEAL DEPOSIT OF DESMOPLASTIC SMALL ROUND CELL TUMOUR.
