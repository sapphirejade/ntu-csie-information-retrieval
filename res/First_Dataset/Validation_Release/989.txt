CLINICAL:
Pineal tumour.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Pineal tumour", consists of a piece of brown coloured friable tissue/blood clot 25 x 18 x 12mm with fragments of pale tissue and blood clot 25 x 15x 5mm in total aggregate.  Block 1 - fragmented pale tissue and blood clot; 2-4 - nodular tissue. AE.   (TO: XA;GF/ec   16.5.64) 

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr O Lunford & registrar Dr O Montero) 
Sections show moderately cellular tumour growing mostly in solid sheets and in large lobules.  Thereis focal rosette formation.  The tumour cells are monomorphic with mildly atypical round to oval nuclei and stippled chromatin.  Mitotic figures are sparse, numbering up to 1 per 10 high power fields.  There is no necrosis.
The tumour cells stain positive for CD 56 and synaptophysin and there is focal filamentous positive staining for neurofilament.  The tumour cells do not stain for chromgranin A or GFAP.  The proliferation index with a Ki-67 stain is around 2%.
Comment:
In view of diffuse growth pattern, focal staining for neurofilament and occasional mitotic figures, this tumour is best regarded as a pineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation (WHO grade 2).

DIAGNOSIS
Pineal tumour:  Pineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation (WHO grade 2).
