CLINICAL:
VIN.  Anterior vulvectomy.  Vulval cancer, previous posterior vulvectomy.  Anterior vulva (stitch 12 o'clock)
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulva stitch 12 o'clock", consists of an anterior vulvectomy with a stitch marking the 12 o'clock margin measuring 70mm from 3 to 9 o'clock, 35mm from 12 to 6 o'clock.  The labia majora is identified.  The skin is wrinkly and pigmented with an area of erosion measuring 20mm in maximum diameter located 15mm from the 12 o'clock margin, 15mm from the 6 o'clock margin and more than 30mm from 3 and 9 o'clock margin.  The 12 o'clock margin is inked blue and 6 o'clock margin inked black.  The specimen is AE according to the attached diagram.
Blocks: 1 - shave of 9 o'clock margin; 2 to 17 - serial sections from 12 to 6 o'clock; 18 - shave of 3 o'clock margin.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right posterior margin", consists of an unorientated piece of skin 25 x 10 x 5mm.  The surface of the skin is pigmented and wrinkly.  The specimen is serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.  (TO: OT;SN/vo 3.2.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. W Selsor):
A.  The entire specimen has been examined.  Sections show multifocal VIN 3.  VIN 2 focally involves the margins at 8 to 9 o'clock(block 2) and 6 o'clock (block 10).  Invasion appears imminent but not definite.
B.  Sections show a small free floating fragment of high grade VIN.  The remainder ofthe specimen is covered by unremarkable stratified squamous epithelium.  It is uncertain from where this fragment arose and therefore the margins cannot be guaranteed.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Anterior vulva:  VIN 3 (see report re margins).
B.  Right posterior margin:  Small fragment of high grade VIN (SEE ABOVE).
