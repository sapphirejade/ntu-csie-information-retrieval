HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
? recurrent peritoneal disease.
Recurrent CRC parastomal hernia resection.
1. Small bowel resection ? recurrence.
2. Small bowel old stoma ? recurrence peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RECURRENT PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Three pieces of mucoid firm lobulated tissue measuring 15, 7 and 5mm.  Smears and tissue taken for frozen section.

F/S : &amp;quot;Mucinous neoplasm low cellularity, appears probably low grade in this sample but provisional on further sampling, grading on frozen section is not reliable&amp;quot;.  Reported to registrar by Dr. U. Bonnenfant on 10.8.65.

(1 FS; 2 remainder tissue).  AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Received three fragments. The largest is length of small bowel measuring 470mm in length and up to 60mm in diameter with attached mesentery to a width of 30mm.  The outer surface is ragged with tattered mucinous deposits on the serosal surface as well as the mesentery. These deposits range between 5 and 15mm. The cut surface through them is mucinous with no definite firm white area.  There is a stitched area measuring 10x10mm denoting a defect located 130mm of the nearest resection margin.  Another stitch defect measuring  8x7mm located 230mm of the nearest margin.  The mucosal surface is unremarkable with no polyps or tumours identified.  Surrounding the areas of defective mucosal surface becomes haemorrhagic and ulcerated.

The second fragment is a stoma measuring 30x35mm with a rim of skin that is up to 8mm.  The underlying lumen measures 20 and 15mm respectively. The mucosal surface is unremarkable.

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue (consistent with peritoneum) measuring 60x25x15mm with ragged haemorrhagic cut surface.

(1-8 sections of the largest small bowel segment [1&amp;amp;2 LS of each resection margin, 3&amp;amp;4 RS of defect, 5-7 mucinous nodules on the surface, 8 ? three lymph nodes]; 9&amp;amp;10 each LS through the lumen of stoma; 11&amp;amp;12 RS separate ? peritoneum).  RS (M-12/ZH/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. U. Asa)
A.  Sections show well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma including small areas of non mucinous component with desmoplastic stroma.

B.  Sections through the segment of small bowel show serosal deposit of well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  A local lymph node shows reactive changes only.  The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion.  Sections through the ileostomy site show no evidence of tumour.  Sections through the peritoneal fragments show focal acellular mucin.
DIAGNOSIS:
RECURRENT PERITONEAL DISEASE :
-METASTATIC WELL DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.

SMALL BOWEL :
-SEROSAL DEPOSIT OF WELL DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.

ILEOSTOMY SITE :
-NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
