CLINICAL:
?Metastatic melanoma.  Liver lesion.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a piece of liver tissue 120 x 85 x 50mm and weighing 154g.  The convex surface appears to be partially denuded of capsule over an area measuring 80 x 50mm.  The resection margin is inked blue and the capsular surface is inked green.  On the slicing there is a 23 x 22 x 20mm pale indurated nodule abutting the capsular surface and thebare area.  The nodule is 23mm from the resection margin.  The liver away from the nodule appears normal.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - representative sections of tumour; 4 - reserve block; 5 - representative section of the resection margin.(SO/mm 11.7.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Sharr):
Sections show a single deposit of a high grade spindle cell tumour showing occasional marked nuclear pleomorphism, abundant mitoses and areas of geographical necrosis.  The tumour cells show strong positive staining with S100 and moderate positive staining with Fascin.  The PanCK, HMB45 and Melan A stains are negative.  The tumour has the same morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile to the previously reported metastatic melanoma within a left axillary lymph node (44D49574).  
The tumour lies well clear of the surgical resection margin, however in areas the liver capsule appears denuded with tumour cells extending to this denuded surface.  The surrounding liver shows no significant abnormality.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver:  
-  Metastatic melanoma, size approximately 20mm.  
-  Surgical margin well clear.
-  Possible breach of liver capsule.
