CLINICAL:
Mullerian adenocarcinoma.  Interval debulking.  Right tube and ovary, left tube and ovary.  Omentum.
Copy to Dr BOLESLAWS ORKWIS, CABOOLTURE medical oncologist. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a fallopian tube with an adherent ovary.  The fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with a maximum diameter of 15mm.  The ovary is adherent to the tube and measures 20 x 17 x10mm.  On the cut surface of the ovary reveals cystic spaces up to 7mm in maximum dimension.  No definite tumour nodules are identified.  Representative sections in 5 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary", consists of a fallopian tube with attached adherent ovary.  The fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with a maximum external diameter of12mm.  The ovary measures 22 x 12 x 10mm.  The cut surface reveals multiple cream yellow nodules throughout the adherent adnexal tissue.  Representative sections in 5 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omental tissue 230 x 55 x 18mm.  Focally the omentum appears firmer with ill-defined cream areas throughout some parts.  No definite tumour nodules are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (VY/vo 15.4.64)  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Reinhart):
A to C.  Sections show small foci of poorly differentiated residual adenocarcinoma involving right ovary and omentum.  Psammoma type calcification is seen in the omentum.  These foci of tumour are surrounded by extensive fibrosis and scattered macrophages, in keeping with previous neo-adjuvant therapy.  The right fallopian tube, left fallopian tube and left ovary show nosignificant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to C.  Bilateral fallopian tubes, ovaries and omentum - Small foci of residual adenocarcinoma involving right ovary and omentum.
