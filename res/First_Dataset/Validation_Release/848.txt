CLINICAL:
Hilar lymph nodes.  Gallbladder.  Liver resection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a partial hepatectomy measuring 185 x 170 x 70mm and weighing 1176g.  Sequential sectioning shows three distinct tumours measuring 95 x 75 x 75mm, 45 x 40 x 28mm and 7 x 7 x 5mm.  The tumour shows a heterogenous grey tan/brownish cut surfaces with extensive necrosis.  The largest tumour appears 4mm clear of the resection margin.  The other two tumours are well clear of resection margin.  Thebackground liver appears unremarkable.  The two largest tumours abuts the capsule as well.  
Blocks: 1 - smallest tumour; 2 to 5 - largest tumour (4 & 5 - closest margin); 6 & 7 - second largest tumour;8 - tissue for tumour bank; 9 - non neoplastic liver.  
Special stains ordered.
B.  Specimen labelled "Hilar lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 45 x 40 x 15mm containing at least three nodes ranging between 5 and 35mm in greatest dimension.  Lymph nodes are submitted.
Blocks: 1 - one node; 2 - one node bisected; 3 to 5 - largest lymph node. 
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder" consists of an intact gallbladder 100mm in length 35mm in diameter at fundus.  The serosal surface appears smooth.  The mucosa appears smooth.  The mucosa appears velvety and green and the wall is up to 2mm in thickness.  No lymph nodes or stones are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - cystic duct margin and neck; 2 - body; 3 - fundus.   (IU/ta 29/11/62) 
  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Neddo):
A.  Sections of liver show three separate foci of metastatic melanoma.  The tumour shows solid sheet like growth pattern with large areas of necrosis.  The tumour cells show high grade nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm and frequent mitoses.  Some of the tumour cells show intranuclear inclusion and brown pigment within the cytoplasm.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for S-100, HMB-45 and Melan-A.  The stains for MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin) and Hepar-1 are negative.  The liver resection is clear of the tumour.  The liver tissue away from the tumour shows no significant abnormality.
B.  Three (3) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
C.  Sections of gallbladder show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Liver resection - Metastatic melanoma.
B.  Hilar lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/3).
C.  Gallbladder - No significant abnormality.
