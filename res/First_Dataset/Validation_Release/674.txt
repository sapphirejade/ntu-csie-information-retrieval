CLINICAL:
Left sentinel node.  Left breast lesion, re-excision of cavity due to involved margins (invasive component close to superior and superficial margins).
Specimen B:  Dr Johnson-CUNAS confirmed verbally that the three marking stitches can be taken as short superior,medium medial and long lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axillasentinel lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 25 x 15 x 9mm containing one lymph node 15 x 7 x 7mm.  The lymph node is serially sliced.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast lesion", consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches measuring 52mm (lateral to medial) x 27mm (superior to inferior) x 37mm (superficial to deep).  The margins are inked in two colours superior black and inferior blue.  Specimen is serially sliced into ten slices from lateral to medial.  There is a cavity measuring 45 x 10 x 25mm.  No indurated nodules are identified.  
Blocks:  1- slice 1 face (lateral margin); 2 & 3 - slice 2; 4 & 5 - slice 3; 6 & 7 - slice 4; 8 & 9 - slice 5; 10 & 11 - slice 6; 12 & 13 - slice 7; 14 & 15 - slice 8; 16 & 17 - slice 9; 18 - slice 10 en face (medial margin).  AE.  See the diagram.  
(YJ/mm 26.3.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Vivyan):
A.  The single sentinel lymph node identified shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B.  Sections show a 1mm deposit of residual intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).  This focus lies 0.4mm from the inferior resection marginwith a possible intervening benign breast lobule.  All other margins are well clear.  The remaining breast tissue shows foci of columnar cell change with focal microcalcification.  The entire specimen is examined and there is no evidenceof invasive malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Left axilla sentinel lymph node:  No significant abnormality.  
B.  Left breast:  Residual ductal carcinoma in situ, margin very close.
