Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Pelvic node.  SCC cervix.  Cervical cancer 1b.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "(L) External iliac LN" consists of fatty tissue 35 x 10 x 5mm.  One lymph node is identified, 25 x 9 x 5mm.  A second lymph node is identified measuring 10 x 5 x 4mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 - remainder of the tissue.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:  
No tumour seen.  
Phone result to anaesthetist by Dr C Nixa/C Tappendorf at 10.17 on 19.03.14.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, weighing 110g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 70 x 50mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 31mm.  The soft tissue margin is inked blue anteriorly and black posteriorly.  There is an ill defined pale solid mass within the cervix measuring approximately 28 x 25 x 5mm.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 33mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 to 17 - the entire cervix blocked clockwise starting from 3 o'clock; 18 to 20 - full longitudinal section of anterior body; 21 to 24 - full longitudinal section of posterior body.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left fallopian tube" consists of a fallopian tube 50mm in length and up to 9mm in diameter.  The cut surface is unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 - representatives.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right fallopian tube" consists of a fallopian tube 50mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1- representative sections.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of pieces offatty tissue 33 x 20 x 6mm in aggregate.  One lymph node is identified 10mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- remainder of the tissue.  AE.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node"consists of fragments of fibrofatty tissue and blood clots 55 x 40 x 10mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified 30 and 14mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 25 x 8mm in aggregate.  Two likely lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1- one likely lymph node; 2- one likely lymph node; 3 & 4 - the remainder ofthe tissue.  AE.
H.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 45 x 35 x 5mm in aggregate.  Two likely lymph nodes are identified. 
Blocks:  -1 - likely lymph nodes as seen; 2 &3 - remainder of the tissue.  AE 1 block.
I.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 27 x 8 x 3mm.  One lymph node is identified 10 x 3 x 3mm.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node.  
J.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 25 x 7 x 2mm.  One lymph node is identified 12mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node.  (TO: HM:HM/mm 22.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr C Zornes): 
A.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  There is focal metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving the subcapsular sinus of one of the nodes.  The tumour deposit measures 0.5mm in diameter and the total node measures 10mm in main diameter.  The focal deposit is present in the paraffin section but was not present in the frozen section.  
B.  Sections of the cervix show an invasive moderatelydifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  The tumour measures 16mm wide x 13mm long.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is 8mm out of total cervical stromal thickness of 10mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion.  Tumouris 2mm from the ectocervical excision margin at the closest point.  The tumour is ulcerated and no overlying CIN 3 is seen.  The ectocervical margin is free of dysplasia.  
Sections of the endometrium show that this is in late menstrual phase.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  
C, D.  Sections show unremarkable fallopian tubes.  
E.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
F.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
G.  Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumouris seen.  
H.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
I.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
J.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.Left external iliac lymph nodes:  Focal metastatic squamous carcinoma in subcapsular sinus of one node (1/2).  
B.  Uterus:  Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix stage 1B1.
C.  Left fallopian tube:  No abnormality seen.  
D.  Right fallopian tube:  No abnormality seen.  
E.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).  
F.  Left obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).  
G.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4). 
H.  Right obturator lymph nodes.  No tumour (0/6).  
I.  Left common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
J.  Right common iliac lymph node.  No tumour (0/1).
