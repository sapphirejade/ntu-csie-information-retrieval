CLINICAL:
SCC vulva.  COAD. Right lateral inguinal lymph nodes.  Right medial inguinal lymph nodes.  Posterior vulvectomy (stitch posteriorly).  Right femoral lymph nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva, stitch posterior", consists of a vulvectomy specimen, measuring 90mm anterior to posterior and 50mm medial to lateral to a depth of 20mm.  On the right sidethere is subcutaneous tissue at the anterior margin which measures 55 x 30mm to a depth of 10mm.  The epidermal surface of the vulva contains a fungating mass which measures 28 x 30mm and is located on the right side 35mm from the anterior skin margin and 33mm from the posterior skin margin.  The orifice is inked green, the right side is inked blue and the left side is inked black. The specimen is transversely sectioned and all embedded from anterior to posterior, right to left.  Please refer to attached diagram.  AE 59 blocks. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right inguinal lymph node", consists of fibroadipose tissue which measures 65 x 85 x 20mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified. The largest lymph node measures 25 x 20 x 15mm. A piece of tubular tissue 15 x 5mm is also identified.
Blocks 1-3 - largest lymph node trisected; block 4- TS tubular tissue AE 4.  Block 5 - lymph nodes.  All lymph node material embedded.
C.  Specimen labelled"Right lateral inguinal lymph node", consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 70 x 40 x 30mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  
Block - 1 one lymph node; 2 & 3 - lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right femoral lymph nodes", consists of five pieces of tissue 6-20mm.Block 1 - one lymph node; 2 - four lymph nodes. AE. (TO: HV: MQ/ec 28.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr F Ripplinger) 
A. The sections of the vulva show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma, forming a slightly polypoid lesion.  It measures 7mm in thickness, 25mm wide from right to left and 24 mm from anterior to posterior. It is 8 mm from the right margin, 8 mm from the deep margin and 6mm from the left / orifice margin.  It is more than 30 mm from the anterior margin and more than 20 mm from the posterior margin.   Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen (slide A20).  No perineural spread is seen.  The adjacent squamous epithelium shows changes consistent with human papilloma virus infection and mild to moderate squamous dysplasia.  Moderate dysplasia is 10 mm from the closest (right) margin. There is no dysplasia or malignancy at the margins.
B. The sections show reactive changes in the four lymph nodes. The tubular structure is a medium sized artery. There is no evidence of malignancy.
C. The sections show seven partially sclerotic lymph nodes with reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D. The sections show a lymph node partially replaced by fat and dense fibrous tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.
CONCLUSION
A. Posterior vulva: Moderately differentiatedsquamous cell carcinoma, clear of margins; focal lymphovascular invasion present.
B-D. Right inguinal and femoral nodes: No malignancy in twelve lymph nodes.
