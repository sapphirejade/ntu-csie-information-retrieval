CLINICAL:
Extended right hemicolectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Extended right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 210mm in length including section of terminal ileum 60mm in length.  No appendix is included in the specimen.  45mm from the distal resection margin there is a circumferential ulcerated tumour over a32mm area.  Over this area the serosa has areas of fat which appears adherent to the serosal surface.  The cut surface reveals that the tumour invades to a maximum depth of 15mm through the muscularis propria into the mesenteric fat and focally appears to abut the peritoneal surface over the fat.  On the mucosal surface a ?polyp is identified 45mm from the ileocaecal junction.  
Blocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 to 5 - representative tumour deepest point of invasion; 6 - tumour normal mucosa; 7 - ?polyp; 8 - representative colon mucosa; 9 - apical node; 10 - 12- lymph nodes.  (CN/mm 9.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Z Sadvary):

Site of tumour:	
Maximum tumour diameter:  32mm
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:   45mm (distal)
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  15	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
