CLINICAL:
Previous clear cell cancer of (L) ovary.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left uterosacral nodule" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 5 x 5 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left IP nodule" consists of one piece of fibrofatty tissue, 10 x 10 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall peritoneum" consists of an irregular piece of fibrous tissue, 15 x 5 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue, 50 x 20 x 5mm with three lymph nodes, 2, 7, 10mm.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - two lymph nodes; 3 - rest of fatty tissue.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator" consists of two lymph nodes, 5 and 20mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- one lymph node.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of a left tube, 50 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria is present and an ovary, 40 x 30 x20mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1- two LS and two TS of the fallopian tube; 2 & 3 - representative sections from the ovary.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum, 100 x 40 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - three representativesections of the omentum.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Suprapubic port peritoneal nodule" consists of a nodular pieceof tissue, 10 x 5 x 5mm.  Specimen is bisected and AE 1 block.  
(GT/mm 25.12.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr P Easterling):
A.  Sections show acutely inflamed granulation tissue consistent with previous surgery.  No endometriosis is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B & C.  Sections show foci of endometriosis. There is no evidence of malignancy 
D.  The three (3) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy. 
E.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections of the ovary show an endometriotic cyst plus multiple foci of endometriosis.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
G.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
H.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show scar.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.   Left uterosacral nodule:  No endometriosis seen. 
B.   Left IP nodule:  Endometriosis present.  
C.   Left pelvic side wall:  Endometriosis present. 
D.   Left external iliac lymph nodes:  Three negative lymph nodes.
E.   Left obturator lymph nodes: Two negative lymph nodes.
F.   Left tube and ovary:  Endometriosis.
G.  Omentum:  No significant abnormality. 
H.  Suprapubic port:  Scar.
