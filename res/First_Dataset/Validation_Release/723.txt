CLINICAL:
BRCA 1 mutation 2047 - Triple negative breast cancer.  Both ovaries + tubes.  Endometrial curettings.  Omental biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovary and tube" consists of a piece of tissue measuring 35 x 45 x 8mm, containing fallopian tubeand ovary.  The ovary measures 22 x 15 x 8mm.  The outer surface is lobulated and the cut surface is unremarkable.  A 45mm segment of fallopian tube with a maximum diameter of 5mm is present.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  Near the fimbria, there is a cyst measuring 3mm in maximum extent.  Its outer surface is smooth and shiny and filled with clear fluid.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - TS ovary; 3 & 4 - TS fallopian tube from proximal to distal (block 4 - cyst); 5 & 6 - LS fimbria.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary and tube" consists of a piece of tissue measuring 45 x 45 x 18mm, containing fallopian tube and ovary.  The ovary measures 25 x 18 x 15mm.  The outer surface is lobulated and the cut surface shows a corpus luteum measuring 15 x 10 x 12mm.  The remainder of the cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  The attached segment of fallopian tube measures 5mm in length with maximum diameter of 3mm.  The serosalsurface is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - TS ovary; 4 & 5 - TS fallopian tube from proximal to distal; 6 - LS fimbria end.

C.  Specimen labelled "Endometrial curettings" consists of multiple fragments of grey and brown tissue measuring in aggregate 8 x 8 x 2mm.   AE 1 block.
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 30 x 20 x 8mm.  The serosal surface and the cut surface is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - TS omental tissue.   (GZ/ta 24/5/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Keleman):
A. The sections of the ovary show primordial follicles, a corpus luteum and corpora albicantes.  A few small mesothelial inclusion cysts areseen.  No significant atypia is seen and the P53 immunoperoxidase stain of ovarian tissue is negative.  Small thin walled serous cysts are seen in the serosa of the tube.  There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia in the fallopian tube.
B. The sections of the ovary show a small (1.5mm) epidermoid cyst.  Adjacent to thisis a larger (10mm) cyst containing loose lamellated keratin lined by cells with features of a foreign body reaction.  No adnexal structures are seen.  Small mesothelial inclusion cysts, primordial anddeveloping follicles, a haemorrhagic corpus luteum and corpora albicantes are also seen.   The fallopian tube shows no significant atypia. There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia including with Ki67 and P53 immunoperoxidase stains.
C. The sections show mid secretory endometrium.  Some of the glands show metaplastic changes.  There is no evidence of endometritis, endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.  There is possibly endocervical glandular hyperplasia.  The slides of this specimen have also been shown to Dr C Inloes.

D. The sections show lobulated mature adipose tissue consistent with omentum.  There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia.
CONCLUSION
A. Right ovary and fallopian tube:
B. Left ovary and fallopian tube: Epidermoid cyst.
C. Endometrial curettings: Mid secretory endometrium.
D. Omental biopsy: No evidence of malignancy.
