CLINICAL:
Right breast DCIS - hook wire wide local excision.  Short superior, long lateral, medium medial.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion stitch short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of a wide local excision measuring 56 x 31 x 83mm (sutures taken as described).  There is an irregularly shaped overlying piece of skin measuring up to 34 x 19mm.  Protruding from the superior aspect of the skin surface is a hook wire.  Lateral margin inked red, inferior margin inked black and superior margin inked blue.  Specimen serially sectioned from deep to superficial in fifteen slices.  Cut section shows fibrous fatty tissue with multiple cystic areas, no discrete lesion identified.  Hook wire tip present in slice three.  There is a haemorrhagic cyst present in slice five and six measuring up to 8mm in diameter.  AE according to attached diagram.
Blocks: 1 to 5 - slice one; 6  & 7 - slice two; 8 to 10 - slice three (hook wire tip); 11 to 13 - slice four; 14 to 16 - slice five; 17 to 19 - slicesix; 20 to 23 - slice seven; 24 to 27 - slice eight; 28 to 31 - slice nine; 32 to 35 - slice ten; 36 to 39 - slice eleven; 40 & 41 - slice twelve; 42 & 43 - slice thirteen; 44 & 45 fourteen; 46 to 49 - slice fifteen.   AE 49 blocks.  (ED/Ta 11/3/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr A Reamy - 12.3.2063)
Sections of the right breast tissue show widespread involvement by a spectrum of proliferative changes. There is extensive columnar cell change/hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia/hyperplasia, fibrocystic change, pseudo-angiomatous stromal hyperplasia, adenosis/apocrine adenosis, a benign intra-duct papilloma and numerous benign microcalcifications. Scattered foci of atypical apocrine hyperplasia, as well as, focal atypical ductal hyperplasia (apocrine-type - block 12), are also present. Atypical apocrine hyperplasia is 1.1mm from the superior and lateralmargins and is clear of the remaining margins (>5.5mm). The focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia is 2.2mm from the superior margin and clear of the remaining margins (>10mm). Scattered microcalcifications are present in association with the atypical apocrine hyperplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia (apocrine type). There are numerous foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia/lobular carcinoma in situ (ALH/LCIS) throughout the entire biopsy. A focus of organising haemorrhage and a biopsy tract, consistent with recent biopsy are present. The overlying skin shows a focus of dermocutaneous scar, but there are no features of Paget's disease. There is no convincing DCIS or evidence of invasive carcinoma.
Representative slides of this case have been shown to Dr A Glausier.


DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast lesion (hookwire WLE):
Multifocal atypical apocrine metaplasia, 1.1mm to the superior and lateral margins.
Focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia, 2.2mm to superior margin (clear of remaining margins). 
No convincing DCIS or evidence of invasive carcinoma.
