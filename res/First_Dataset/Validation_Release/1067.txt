CLINICAL:
Liver resection.  
(Previous colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver mets, 09D8255 and 09D8255)
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a wedge of liver unorientated measuring 70 x 60 x 50mm.  The surgical margin is dusky and irregular.  On the serosal surface there is an area of puckering measuring 30 x 20mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  On sectioning in the area of serosal puckering there is a solid white and nodular tumour measuring 30 x 20 x 28mm.  It is located 8mm away from the closest surgical margin.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 - tumour close to the surgical margin; 2 to 4 - representative tumour; 5 - tumour for tissue bank; 6 - one representative section away from the tumour.  
(LB/mm 25.9.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr B Harrod):
Sections show a 30mm deposit of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin.  The lesion has a complex glandular architecture and is composed of columnar to polygonal tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  Large areas of necrosis are seen.  The lesion is 8mm from the liver resection margin.  There is no evidence of surface serosal involvement.
In the adjacent liver there is focal bridging fibrosis (block 11) associated with a hepatocyte entrapment.  Areas of hyperplasia with atrophy in the periphery are seen on reticulin staining, possibly representing nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Mild macrovesicular steatosis and focal minimal iron deposition (on Perl stain) are present in the hepatocytes. No copper binding proteins are seen on Rhodamine and orcein stains.
DIAGNOSIS
Liver resection: 30mm metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin, margins clear
