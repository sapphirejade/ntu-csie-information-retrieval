CLINICAL:
Left breast cancer.  Previous WLE with involved margins.  Completion mastectomy.  Scar superior to nipple.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left breast ST axilla" consists of a mastectomy measuring 150mm (medial to lateral)  x 120mm (superior to inferior) x 45mm (superficial to deep).  Thereis an ellipse of skin measuring 150 x 75mm. The ellipse of skin has a nipple areolar complex and a linear scar measuring 35mm in length.  The skin around the scar appears puckered with an indurated appearance.  There is a suture (axillary tail).  The superficial surface inked blue and the deep black.  On sectioning there is a multicystic cavity within the breast tissue measuring 25 x 25 x 15mm.  The cavity margins are as follows: 28mm - superior, 45mm - inferior, 12mm - deep, 18mm - superficial, 28mm - medial and 55mm - lateral.  The cavity is multiloculated with thin septae dividing the cavity.  Some cystic areas are filled with brown haemorrhagic material and blood clot.  The surrounding breast tissue is solid and fibrotic.  There is an area of pale yellow ?necrosis located immediately lateral to the cavity.  
Blocks: 1 - nipple areola complex; 2 to 3 - medial margin of cavity; 5 to 7 - superior margin of cavity; 8 to 10 - lateral margin of cavity; 11 to 13 - inferior margin of cavity; 14 to 16 - deep margin of cavity; 17 to 19 - superficial margin of cavity; 20 & 21 - outer upper quadrant; 22 & 23 - upper inner quadrant; 24 & 25 - lower inner quadrant; 26 & 27 - lower outer quadrant.  
 
 B.  Specimen labelled "Extra inferior flap ST superficial" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 95 x 45 x 10mm.  There is a suture on one side (designated superficial) and inked blue, the opposite inked black.  Specimenserially sectioned.  Breast tissue appears unremarkable.  AE 12 blocks.  (NP/ta 2/3/64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Morck):
A.  The perimeter of the surgical cavity is extensively sampled together with each quadrant of the breast and there is no evidence of residual malignancy.  The remaining breast tissue shows benign changes only with foci of columnar cell, apocrine and fibrocystic change and occasional foci ofluminal microcalcification. The nipple shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy.  
B.  Sections show benign breast ductsand lobules only.  There is no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.   Left breast:  
-    No residual carcinoma identified.
-    Scattered benign proliferative changes only. 
B.  Extra inferior flap superficial:  No significant abnormality.
