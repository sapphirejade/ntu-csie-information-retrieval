CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma.  (R) lower lobe apical segment.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Paratracheal lymph node" consists of a black nodule partly covered by adipose tissue, 25 x 15 x 10mm.  All embedded in 2 blocks.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Subcarinal lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of a black nodule measuring in aggregate 40 x 30 x 10mm.  AE 3 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right lower lung lobe plus middle lobe" consists of a right lower lobe and a middlelobe.  The right lower lobe measures 140mm (medial to lateral), 160mm (anterior to posterior) and 160mm (superior to inferior).  In the superior aspect of the lobe there is an area of pleural puckering, 15 x 10mm.  It is located 50mm from the surgical margin.  On sectioning and in the area of pleural puckering there is an ill defined white/black solid tumour measuring 17 x 12 x 15mm.  Macroscopically it appears to abut the pleura.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  
The middle lobe measures 150 x 100 x 80mm.  The pleura has a small yellow nodule, 4 x 4mm.  On sectioning the parenchyma is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 -13 - right lower lung (1- vascular margin; 2- bronchial margin; 3 to 5 - one bisected peribronchial lymph node each; 6 to 10 - tumour (10 - tissue selected for tissue bank); 11 - two representative sections of normal lung; 12 - one bisected intralobar lymph node; 13 - two intralobar lymph nodes;) 14 - 16 middle lobe (14- tiny pleural nodule; 15 & 16 - representative sections)  (YC/mm 27.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr V Rajaratnam):
A.  The six (6) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The twelve (12) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections of the right lower lobe show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a focally lipidic growth pattern at the advancing edge of the tumour.  No vascular or perineural invasion is identified.  The tumour measures 16mm across and lies well clear of the bronchial resection margin.  Although the tumour comes close to the visceralpleura there is no breach of the pleural surface.  The bronchial resection margin is well clear of tumour.  One of six (1/6) lymph nodes identified shows adenocarcinoma, possibly invaded by direct spread.  The surrounding lung tissue andrepresentative sections of the middle lobe show emphysematous change but no other significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Right lower and middle lobes, lymph nodes:
-	Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of right lower lobe;
-	Size 16mm, well clear of bronchial resection margin;
-	No invasion of visceral pleura;
-	Adenocarcinoma within one intralobar lymph node;
-	Stage T1a N1 MX.
