CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer on curettings.  Previous bowel cancer. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid lesion", received fresh, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 25 x 20mm with a plaque-like piece of tissue 10 x 10 x 2mm.  Two representative sections for FS.  Block 1 - FS; 2 - rest of FS. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation. 
Result to Dr X Beem by Dr X Kurien at 3:55pm on 26.6.12. 
B.   Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, left tube", consists of a uterus with attached cervix and left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 181g in total. The uterus measures 110 x 70 x 60mm. The serosal surface has an area of puckering in the fundus extending anteriorly and posteriorly. The cervix measures 30 x 25mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The myometrium measures 25mm and has a friable consistency. The endometrium measures 10mm. The left ovary measures 20 x 5 x 5mm and appears unremarkable. The leftfallopian tube measures 70 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria is identified macroscopically.  It is unremarkable. 
Block 1-5 - 1 full LS of anterior body and cervix; 7 - 1 section anterior endomyometrium; 8-13 - 1 full LS of posterior body and cervix; 14 - 1 full face posterior endomyometrium; 15 - right parametrial tissue; 16 - left parametrial tissue; 17 - 2 LS and 1TS left fimbria; 18 - 3 representative sections from the left ovary; 19 - 1 representative section from the left broad ligament; 20- selected tissue for tissue bank.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a cystic lesion with fallopian tube attached. The cyst measures 60x 45 x 30mm. It has a smooth and shiny external surface.  It is filled with serous material.  The internal surface is shiny and smooth.  No solid areas are identified. The fallopian tube measures 70 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria is identified. The external surface is unremarkable.  Block 1- 2LS fimbria; 2 - 1TS fallopian tube; 3-6 - representative sections from the cyst.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary", consists of three nodular pieces of tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm, 10 x 10 x 5mm, 5 x 5 x5mm and a piece of elastic membranous tissue measuring 45 x 10 x 2mm.  On sectioning the largest nodule is tan, solid with bony consistency.  Block 1- two small nodules; 2 - largest nodule; 3 - membranous piece of tissue. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left paracervical tissue", consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue 15 x 10 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Omental nodule", consists of a piece of tissue 5 x 3 x 2mm. AE 1 block.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omentum 130 x90 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable. Representative sections in 3 blocks. 
(VP/ec 29.8.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Heine) 
A.  Sections showendometrioid adenocarcinoma.
B.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour shows full thickness myometrial invasion (25mm through a wall 25mm thick) and focal lymphvascular invasion.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The right and left parametrium show tumour deposits in lymphatics, large veins and within the soft tissue.  Tumour thrombi are also seen within large vessels of the left paraovarian softtissue and the left broad ligament.
C.  Sections show a benign simple serous cyst of the ovary.  The tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show ovarian stroma with an adjacent hyalinised and calcified structure probably representing a very old fibroma.  In addition, adjacent adenocarcinoma deposits are present.
  
E, F & G.  Fat necrosis isseen in specimen F.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Very extensive grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with full thickness myometrial invasion and extensive soft tissue deposits and tumour thrombi within parametrium, broad ligament and sigmoid.
