CLINICAL:
Right hemicolectomy.  Colon cancer. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of a specimen of terminal ileum (85mm in length), caecum and ascending colon (230mm in length), vermiform appendix (70mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter) and attached fatty tissue (up to 70mm across).  There is an indurated polypoid tumour in the ascending colon 35 x 25 x 12mm.  The tumour is 55mm from the distal and well clear of the proximal resection margins.  No other polypoid lesions are identified.  The tumour occupies 40% of the circumference of the large bowel.  The tumour has invaded into and possibly through the muscularis propria. The vermiform appendix has a smooth and glistening serosal surface and normal cut surfaces. There are several lymph nodes within the attached fatty tissue.   Block 1 - proximal and distal margins; 2-4 - TS, tumour all embedded; 5 - tumour and adjacent normal mucosa; 6 - TS tumour, reserve block; 7 - 1LS tip and 2TS mid appendix; 8 - apical lymph node bisected; 9 to 11: lymph nodes; 12 - one likely lymph node bisected; 13 & 14 - sections of fat looking for lymph node. 
(TO: HM;HM/ec 17.7.63) 15-34 - more sections of fat looking for lymph nodes
   
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Q Avera) 

Site of tumour: Ascending colon	
Maximum tumour diameter:     35mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:     55mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  13	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
