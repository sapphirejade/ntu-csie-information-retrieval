Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Large sarcoma left anterior thigh - overlying superficial femoral vessels, encasing long saphenous vein, neo-adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy.  Blue: medial-superficial.  Dx: Myxoid liposarcoma.  Double stitch = inferior - margin long saphenous.  
[Please note: The specimen was sampled for Cytogenetics prior to fixation].
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left thigh" consists of a piece of solid soft tissue 150 x 100 x 50mm.  There is a double stitch marking inferior.  The margins are inked in three colours: medial/superficial blue, deep/lateral green and anterior edge black.  The specimen is serially sliced from superior to inferior into fifteen slices.  The cut surface has a variegated appearance and shows yellow lobulated firm areas, necrotic areas and adipose tissue.  There is a vein 50mm in length at the deep margin.  The inferior cut end of the vein is adjacent to the marking stitch.  Approximately 20% of the specimen is necrotic.  
Blocks:  1 - inferior margin of the saphenousvein (shaved margin); 2 & 3 - representative slice 1 (superior margin); 4 - anterior edge slice 2; 5 - superficial slice 3; 6 - deep slice 3; 7 - anterior slice 4; 8 - posterior slice 5; 9 - representative slice 5 with no margins, reserveblock; 10 - posterior slice 6; 11 - deep slice 7; 12 - centre slice 9; 13, 14 & 15 - sections of deep margin including vein from slices 12 to 14; 16 - section including vein from slice 15; 17 & 18 - representative sections slice 15 (inferior margin).  Please see attached diagram.  (QL/cc 16/5/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Krausz - 20.5.2063)
The left anterior thigh tumour is a myxoid liposarcoma. The tumour is partially encapsulated and consists of lobules of chondromyxoid stroma containing atypical adipocytes and lipoblasts, a chicken-wire network of thin walled vessels and scattered pseudolymphangioma-like spaces. Broad areas of necrosis (macroscopically involving 20%) and a prominent foreign body type giant cell reaction are present, and may represent effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Two reactive lymph nodes are identified. Sections of the saphenous vein show no significant histologic abnormality. No evidence of round cell component or high grade dedifferentiation is seen. The relationship of tumour to the margins is as follows:
Margins:
Posterior margin: Present at margin (Block 8)
Anterior margin: Less than 0.2mm (Block 7)
Superior margin: 0.70 (Block 
Inferior margin: 10mm (Block 17/18)
Superficial (medial): >11 (Block 5)
Deep (lateral): 2.0 (Block 11)
DIAGNOSIS:
Left anterior thigh tumour: Myxoid liposarcoma, present at posterior margin.
Please correlate with cytogenetics findings.
