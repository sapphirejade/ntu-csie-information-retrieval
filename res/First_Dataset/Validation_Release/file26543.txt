SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (7.8.2066)
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right ovarian mass&amp;quot;, consists of an 80 x 35 x 15mm presumed collapsed cyst with a 40 x 35 x 15mm solid nodular area.  Sectioning of the solid area shows haemorrhagic tissue.  No papillary excrescences are seen.  Two representative sections of solid area for frozen sections 1 and 2.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - frozen section one and two; 3 to 15 - RS remaining tissue (approximately 50% embedded).

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma - cannot exclude a metastasis.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a 65 x 7mm fallopian tube with 60 x 35 x 15mm adherent ragged soft tissue without macroscopically identifiable ovary.  Additional irregular pieces of tan soft tissue are present separately within the container, 50 x 35 x 15mm in aggregate.  On sectioning of the fallopian tube, the adjacent soft tissue shows a cystic lesion with a tan mass, 10mm in thickness.  No cyst contents are identified.  Possible residual ovary is noted in a separate piece of soft tissue.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - fallopian tube with cystic lesion; 4 - additional section of cystic lesion; 5 - fimbrial end; 6 and 7 - lesional tissue with residual ovary.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a 50 x 7mm fallopian tube, which is adherent to 35 x 30 x 20mm soft tissue and a partly solid, partly cystic 60 x 65 x 35mm lesion.  The lesion has a predominantly smooth serosal surface with a 65 x 10mm opening.  Transverse sectioning through the fallopian tube and adjacent soft tissue shows a 17 x 22 x 24mm cystic tumour.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - fallopian tube with firm cream lesion; 3 - fimbrial end; 4 to 8 - RS of solid/cystic mass.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of 265 x 135 x 30mm of omental fat.  Sectioning shows homogenous yellow fat with no discrete lesions.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - RS.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental fat&amp;quot;, consists of two fatty tissues, 40 x 40 x 5mm in aggregate.  Sectioning shows homogenous pale yellow fat with no discrete lesions.  AE 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Anagnos):
A, B &amp;amp; C.  Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving both ovaries.  Focally the adenocarcinoma has a garland architecture with &amp;apos;dirty&amp;apos; necrosis and some mucin.  The majority of the architecture is endometrioid.  The tubes show no significant abnormality.
The bilateral tumours show patchy positivity for CK7, diffuse positivity for PAX8, and are negative for CK20 and CDX2, consistent with an ovarian primary.

D &amp;amp; E.  The omentum shows show no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of both ovaries.  The tubes and the omentum are negative.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr M Stoeke 7.5.2066):
MSI immunohistochemistry was performed as requested.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block C2)
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
