RS (M-36/EE/nh)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. E. Bourlier)
A. Sections show fibrofatty tissue infiltrated by irregular glands and single cells of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Adjacent tissue shows granulomatous reaction to polarisable material.

B. The gallbladder mucosa is unremarkable. The lamina propria is slightly fibrotic. The muscular layer is not thickened. There is a sprinkling of lymphocytes in the wall. The serosal surface shows acute inflammation. No mucin or tumour deposits are identified.

The appendix shows focal acute inflammation of the mucosa in the tip of the appendix. The mucosal architecture is otherwise unremarkable. This acute inflammation is separate to the scattered acute inflammatory infiltrate present on the free serosal surface. There is no mucin or malignancy in the appendix.

The spleen shows red pulp and white pulp within normal limits. The splenic capsule shows attached acute inflammation and reactive stroma. There is no malignancy.

The omentum shows metastatic adenocarcinoma composed of large glands, some cribriforming, with pencillate nuclei and luminal tumour necrosis.

The peritoneum shows a 3mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma and several smaller foci. There is also granulomatous inflammation surrounding acellular proteinaceous material.

The large bowel serosal surface shows multiple deposits of desmoplastic stroma containing a few glands of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The serosa of the proximal and distal resection margin is unremarkable. A 3mm tumour deposit is seen within the serosa (B20). The mucosa of the large bowel fragment is unremarkable.

The right fallopian tube shows benign paratubal cyst. The right ovary shows a 8mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar histological features to that seen in the omentum. The left fallopian tube and ovary are unremarkable.

Further multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma are seen in the peritoneum surrounding the umbilicus, up to 2.5mm across. The skin surface is unremarkable. The soft tissue underlying skin shows granulomatous inflammation surrounding polarisable material. The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable. The endometrium shows features of exogenous hormone. There is no malignancy in the uterus.

Immunohistochemistry shows the tumour glands in the omentum and peritoneum are positive for CDX2

*Hot spot mutations are tested by this method rather than full exon assessment (see test description). BRAF V600E IMMUNOIDSTOCHEMISTRY:  NEGATIVE
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Patients with tumours harbouring mutations in KRAS or NRAS exons 2, 3 or 4 predict lack of response to anti-EGFR therapies such as cetuximab or panitumumab (Douillard et al NEJM 2013; 369:1023-34; Stintzing et al Hematol Oncol Clin North Am 2015; 1:43-60; Peeters et al Drugs 2015; 75:731-48).
When considering an EGFR inhibitor for the treatment ofmCRC, there is no clear evidence that BRAF is a negative predictive marker.
Data suggest that BRAF mutations are an indicator of poor prognosis in mCRC regardless of treatment.
TEST DESCRIPTION
The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is intended to detect 7 mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene, namely c.34G&amp;gt;T (G12C); c.34G&amp;gt;C (G12R); c.34G&amp;gt;A (Gl2S); c.35G&amp;gt;C (G12A); c.35G&amp;gt;A (G12D);
c.35G&amp;gt;T (G12V) and c.38G&amp;gt;A (Gl3D). KRAS mutations have been associated with resistance to Erbitux.
COMMENT
*	This test does not diagnose cancer.  It is intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to
