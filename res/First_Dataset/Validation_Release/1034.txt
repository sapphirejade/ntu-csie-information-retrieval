CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, right and left tubes and ovaries" consists ofa uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 116g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 30 x 30mm.  The serosal surface has several fibroids measuring from 5 up to 20mm.  The ectocervix measuring 25 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is soft, tan, friable and has a maximum thickness of 15mm.  The myometrium with a maximum thickness of 22mm.  The myometrium has several intermural fibroids measuring up to 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right fallopian tube measures 80 x 5 x 5mm.  The fimbria is present, serosal surface is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 20 x 15 x 5mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  The cut surface is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 40 x 5 x 5mm and the fimbriais present and macroscopically unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 15 x 10 x 5mm.  The external surface is unremarkable and on sectioning it is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 -one full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - two representative sections of anterior endomyometrium; 7 - one representative section of anterior endomyometrium with fibroids; 8 to 11 - one full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 12 & 13 - two representative sections of posterior endomyometrium with tumour; 14 - endomyometrium with tumour selected for tissue bank; 15 - two LS right fimbria; 16 - one representativesection of the right ovary and one TS right fallopian tube; 17 - two LS left fimbria; 18 - one representative section of the left ovary and one TS left fallopian tube; 19 - right parametrial tissue; 20 - left parametrial tissue. 
B.Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a lymph node 30 x 15 x 5mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of one lymph node measuring 55 x 15 x 5mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - bisected lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of tissue 50 x 30 x 20mm with six lymph nodes measuring from 5 to 20mm.  
Blocks: 1 - bisected lymph node; 2 - two lymph nodes; 3 - two lymph nodes; 4 - onelymph node.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40 x 25 x 5mm with a lymphnode 15 x 10 x 5mm.  The specimen is bisected and AE in 1 block.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common lymph node" consists of a piece of fat tissue 5 x 3 x2mm.  No lymph nodes are identified.  AE 1 block. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac" consists of a piece of fatty tissue15 x 5 x 2mm.  No lymph nodes identified.  AE 1 block.
 
H.Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of omentum 130 x 90 x 10mm.  No tumour deposits are identified macroscopically.  Three representative sections in 3 blocks.   (FS/ta7/9/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr E Langmaid):
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 11mm through a wall 13mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.  
B.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
C.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F.   No lymph nodes are present in this tissue.
G.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, maximum depth of invasion 11mm through a wall 13mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion ispresent.  Cervix uninvolved.  Ten lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
