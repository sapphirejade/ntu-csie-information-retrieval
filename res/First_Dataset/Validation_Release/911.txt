ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (2.3.63)

CLINICAL:
Left frontal haemorrhage, underlying lesion on MRI, ?high grade glioma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left frontal lobe tumour" consists of a piece of tan/red tissue measuring 18 x 14 x 5mm.  A 10 x 10 x 5mm piece sent for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section AE; 2 - remainder of tissue AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
High grade glioma.
Phone result to Dr Disalvi by Dr K Ekstrand/Dr K Mervin at 3.59pm on 3/1/13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left frontal tumour" consists of multiple fragments of tan and haemorrhagic tissue 50 x 50x 15mm in aggregate.  The majority of the specimen has a ragged external edge while a few small focal areas appear smooth.  AE five blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Posterior left frontal tumour" consists of fragments of tan, cream and haemorrhagic tissue measuring 25 x 20 x 12mm in aggregate.  A few small pieces appear smooth and glistening while the remainder appears ragged.  AE two blocks.    (KT/cc  6/3/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Sweets): 
A to C. Sections show a cellular lesion, composed of sheets of tumour cells with small ovoid to elongated nuclei and minimal cytoplasm.  Scattered mitoses, endothelial proliferation, palisading and non-palisading necrosis are present. Areas of infarction, haemorrhage withhaemosiderin and haematoidin deposition are seen. Focally there are thin walled vessels present in the background.
Together with immunohistochemical findings, the features would favour a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4), small cell variant.  1p/19q and EGFR FISH testing will be performed to exclude the possibility of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.

Immunohistochemical stains: 
GFAP: Patchy positive staining
IDH1: -ve
Ki67 index: up to 30%
p53: positive in < 1% of tumour 

Molecular tests: 
Tissue will be sent to Dr MARLIN DOCKERY, ST GEORGE HOSPITAL (QLD) Cancer Centre for MGMT methylation testing.
Tissue will be sent to COBAR DISTRICT HOSPITAL's Hospital, BUNINYONG, for 1p/19q and EGFR FISH.

Block for potential treatmenttrial: 
Tumour including the more proliferative nodules is best seen in block B4. 


DIAGNOSIS:
A to C. Left frontal tumour
- High grade glioma, favour glioblastoma (WHO grade 4), small cell variant
- 1p/19q and EGFR FISH (to exclude anaplastic oligodendrogioma) pending.
ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (17.3.63)

Dr K Bevington, SEALS central's Pathology reports:

RESULTS:
This case was analysed for 1p/19q LOH using Vysis dual colour probe sets LSI 19q13/19p13.  Cut off values were adopted Smith et al. 2000 (J ClinOncol: 18;636-645) who defined a 1p/1q ratio of <0.85 and a 19q/19p ratio of <0.9 as indicating LOH.  The case was also hybridised with Vysis LSI EGFR/Cep7 dual colour probe pair to assess whether amplification of EGFR was present.
Chromosome 1
Mean copies 1p per cell: 2.25
Mean copies 1q per cell: 2.05
1p/1q ratio: 1.1
Interpretation: Negative for 1p loss
Chromosome 19
Mean copies 19q per cell: 2.29
Mean copies 19p per cell: 2.15
19q/19p ratio: 1.07
Interpretation: Negative for 19q loss
EGFR:
Mean copies of EGFR per cell: 34.0
Mean copies cep7 per cell: 2.95
EGFR/cep7 ratio: 11.52
Interpretation:  High level EGFR amplification present.
CONCLUSION:  EGFR amplification is present, consistent with (primary) small cell glioblastoma.  

ADDITIONAL REPORT (2.3.63)
Tissue has been sent to Dr Aristide MCMAKIN, CENTRAL GIPPSLAND HEALTH SERVICE (MAFFRA) Cancer Centre for MGMT methylation testing.
The lesion shows NO evidence of MGMT methylation.
