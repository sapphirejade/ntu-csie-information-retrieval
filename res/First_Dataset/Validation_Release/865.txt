SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.1.63):


CLINICAL:
Debulking operation following two cycles of chemotherapy.  Ascitic fluid showed adenocarcinoma of ovarian/peritoneal origin.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, ovaries, cervix, tubes" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 71g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and shows focal punctate haemorrhages.  On opening, the endometrium measures <1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 20mm.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length, up to 5mm in diameter and is interrupted by a tubal ligation clip medially.  The right ovary measures 28x 18 x 9mm and has a vaguely granular outer surface and an atrophic cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length, up to 5mm in diameter and is interrupted by a tubal ligation clip medially.  Paratubal cysts up to 3mm are present.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 13mm, shows a 5mm surface nodule and surface granularity.  The left ovary has an atrophic cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 8 to 10 - right ovary TS AE; 11 & 12 - right fallopian tube TS AE (11 - medial tube, 12 - lateral tube); 12 to 15 - left ovary TS AE; 16 & 17 - left tube TS AE (16 - medial tube, 17 - lateral tube).  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of nodular omental tissue, 180 x 80 x 15mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative; 4 - tumour reserve block. 
(TO: SC; SC/mm 3.1.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr A Sether):
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show that this is inactive. The myometrium is unremarkable.  
Sections of each ovary show deposits of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma on the serosal surfaces and partly extending into the underlying ovary.  There is also tumour involving parovarian soft tissue on the right side.  There is evidence of treatment effect with some tumour replacement by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.  Sections of the right fallopian tube show foci of serous carcinoma at the fimbrial end and also some carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial end.  There is also focal serous carcinoma on the serosa of the tube more proximally.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show necrotic tumour focally in the tube lumen.  There is also serous carcinoma involving part of the fimbrial end of the tube and paratubal soft tissue, and there is some carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial end of the tube.
B.  Sections of omentum show extensive involvement by moderately differentiated serouscarcinoma.  There is evidence of chemotherapy effect, with apparent greater than 50% tumour replacement by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.   
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving serosa of both ovaries, right parovarian soft tissue, left paratubal soft tissue and fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes.  Carcinoma in situ at fimbrial ends of both tubes.   
B.   Omentum:  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.1.63):
B.  Stains for hormone receptors have been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:     Positive.
                                     100% of tumour cells show positive staining
                                     Predominant intensity of staining:   Strong
Progesterone receptor:     Negative.  0% of tumour cells show positive staining.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (29.4.64):
A, B.  This is to clarify that the serous carcinoma is high grade.
