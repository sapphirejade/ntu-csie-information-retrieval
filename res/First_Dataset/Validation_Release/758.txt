CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing103g in total.  The uterus and cervix is received opened along the left lateral wall, and is 80 x 65 x 40mm.  The ectocervix is 35 x 35mm.  There is patchy haemorrhagic change over the ectocervix, predominantly on the left anterior aspect.  Within the posterior endometrial cavity is a vague area of tan discolouration, 15 x 15 x 1mm.  The endometrium appears <1mm thick.  The myometrium is up to 22mm thickness.  There is a posterior intramural fibroid, 5mm across.  Thereis a subserosal fibroid over the fundus, 15mm across.  The left fallopian tube is 70mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary is 30 x 15 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube is 75mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary is 30 x 15 x 10mm.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - midline anterior cervix to fundus including subserosal fibroid; 6 & 7 - left anterior ectocervix from midline towards left lateral; 8 & 9 - left anterior endometrial cavity;10 & 11 - right anterior endometrial cavity; 12 to 15 - midline posterior cervix to fundus; 16 - left posterior endometrial cavity including intramural fibroid; 17 to 20 - right posterior endometrial cavity; 21- left ovary and fallopian tube; 22 - right ovary and fallopian tube.  Endometrium AE.  (TO: DK; HX/rt 22.4.64)
23-23 Remainder right fallopian tube
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Selma):
Sections show tiny foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma and complex hyperplasia.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Tiny foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with no myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.  
COMMENT:
If stains for MSI proteins are required then please request these from the lab that reported the curettings as there is too little residual carcinoma in this hysterectomy specimen for reliable assessment.
