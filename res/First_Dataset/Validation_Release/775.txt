DR EMMITT WEISENFLUH
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Cone biopsy December 2008; poorly differentiated SCC cervix.  Radical hysterectomy for SCC cervix.  Frozen section borderline serous tumour.  Positive lymph node.  Background: SCC cervix on cold knife biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left ovarian cyst" consists of three sheets of pale tissue in aggregate 35 x 30 x 5mm.  Each is 7mm thick.  Representative for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1AE; 2 - frozen section 2 AE; 3 & 4 - residual (80% embedded)
FROZEN SECTION:
Borderline serous tumour - await further sampling.  
Phoned result to Dr Simler (via ?registrar) by Dr H Zourkos at 14.01pm on 02.02.09
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" (received fresh for frozen) consists of fatty tissue containing four nodes ranging from 4 to 25mm.  The two large nodes bisected and half of each embedded.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1 AE; 2 - residual of node in one; 3 - frozen section 2 AE; 4 - residual of frozen section 2 AE; 5 & 6 - each one node AE
FROZEN SECTION:
One nodeshows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
Phoned results to Dr Grims by Dr H Maschke at 15.00pm on 02.02.09
C.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of uterus with attached cervix and a cuff of vagina weighing60g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 35 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 17 x 20mm and bears indistinct surface nodularity but no definite tumour.  The vaginal cuff measures 18 to 20mm in length.  On sectioning the endometrium measures 1mm overlying a myometrium 14mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - shave of posterior and anterior vaginal cuff respectively; 3 to 6 - each one parallel LS of posterolateral cervix; 7 & 8, 9&10 - paired LS of posterior cervix; 11 to 13 - full LS posterior cervix and body; 14 & 15, 16 & 17 - paired LS of right lateral cervix; 18 to 20 - full LS of right anterior cervix and body; 21 to 23 - each one parallel LS anterior cervix (cervix all embedded)
D.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary" consists of a left ovary, 20 x 10 x 7mm, unremarkable on sectioning.  There is a small amount of attached paradnexal tissue
Blocks:  1 & 2 - ovary. AE
E.  Specimen labelled "Left tube" consists of an unremarkable fallopian tube 35mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1 -rep. tube and fimbrae
F.  Specimen labelled "Right ovary" consists of an ovary 20 x 12 x 7mm containing a 12mm cyst with a smooth internal lining.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - rep.
G..  Specimen labelled "Right tube"consists of an unremarkable fallopian tube 35mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.
Blocks:  1 - rep. tube and fimbrae 
H.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of fatty tissue containing four lymph nodes measuring up to 16mm in maximum dimension.  BAE 2 blocks 
I.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of fatty tissue containing two lymph nodes measuring up to 15mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block (FU 5.4.59)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr H Conary)
A.  Sections show a borderline serous tumour with moderate atypical epithelial proliferation.  There is probable surface involvement and non-invasive autoimplants are noted.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.  
B.  One of the four lymph nodes shows a 9mm focus of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.  Intranodal endosalpingiosis is noted.
C.  Sections show one residual focus of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  This has a depth of invasion of 2mm and a width of 0.5mm.  One focus of lymphatic invasion is noted in the right parametrial soft tissues.  
The endometrium is benign and shedding.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The uterine serosa shows endosalpingiosis and endometriosis.
D.  The ovary shows surface non-invasive autoimplants.  There is no evidence ofinvasive malignancy.  
E.  Sections show no significant abnormality.  
F.  Sections show a corpus luteal cyst but no other significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
G.  Sections show no significant abnormality.
H.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
One small focus of residual squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, depth 2mm, width 0.5mm.  One of ten lymph nodes show metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  
Borderline serous tumour of the left ovary.
