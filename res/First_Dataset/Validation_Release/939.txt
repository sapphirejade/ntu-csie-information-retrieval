CLINICAL:
R testicular tumour with pulmonary and retroperitoneal mets.  R testis and cord.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right testis and cord" consists of a testis measuring 75 x 45 x 45mm with attached spermatic cord measuring 75mm and weighing 108g in total.  The cut surface reveals a haemorrhagic necrotic and partly cream-tan tumour taking up the majority of the testis measuring 68 x 36 x 34mm.  The tumour does not appear to invade into the rete testis or into the tunica vaginalis.  
Blocks:  1 - spermatic cord margin; 2 - TS through spermatic cord halfway down cord; 3 to 8 - representative tumour; 9 & 10 - representativerete testis; 11 - reserve block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Rosenfeld): 
Sections of testis show a mixed germ cell tumour including a mixture of embryonal carcinoma (70%), yolk sac tumour (25%) and choriocarcinoma (5%).  Intratubular germ cell neoplasia is present.  Focal areas of necrosis and haemorrhage are present.  There is evidence of focal lymphovascular invasion (block 4).  The tumour is limited to the testis.  The tumour invades the tunica albuginea butnot the tunica vaginalis.  The tumour is completely excised and the resection margin is well clear.  The spermatic cord is unremarkable.  The epididymis is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of perineural invasion.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right testis and cord - Mixed germ cell tumour.
