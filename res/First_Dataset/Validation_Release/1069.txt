CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer.  DVT/PE.  Myasthenia gravis.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes and bilateral ovaries" consists of a partly opened uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 48g in total.  The uterus measures 64 x 40 x 29mm and has a smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 22mm and has a haemorrhagic but unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is an exophytic tumour on the anterior endometrial wall over an area of 27 x 25mm, extending to the right posterior endometrial wall. The tumour is 46mm from the cervical os.  The tumour appears clear of the left and right uterine cornu and appears only superficial.  The endometrium is elsewhere unremarkable and is 2mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains one fibroid 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 44mm in length x 9mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 21 x 15 x 10mm. The adherent mesovarium appear haemorrhagic.  The cut surface of the ovary appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 & 5 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 6 to 9 - representative of tumour anterior body (block 7 - reserve block for tumour bank); 10 - right fallopian tube; 11 - right ovary;12 - right parametrial tissue; 13 - left fallopian tube; 14 - left ovary; 15 - left parametrial tissue.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Drumheiser): 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour appears confined to the endometrium.  No convincing myometrial invasionis seen.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 30/5/63:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
