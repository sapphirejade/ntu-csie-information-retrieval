DR DENVER Jamaal REEKIE
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Bilateral pelvic masses.  Phx lobular breast cancer 2059, 33positive nodes, chemo. 
1.  Ascites.  
2.  Right tube and ovary (frozen section)
3.  Left tube and ovary.
4.  Omental biopsy.  
PR, ER and HER2.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an enlarged solid ovary measuring 90 x 60 x 40mm with attached tubes 60mm in length.  The total weight is 123g.  The ovary has a solidyellow and haemorrhagic appearance with small microcysts in one area.  
(Blocks: 1 - one TS through solidyellow area; 2 - one TS through cystic area.)  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 & 4 - representative (ER,PR, HER2, Ki-67 requested on block 3); 5 - representative fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Signet ring carcinoma consistent with lobular carcinoma from breast (pt has past history of lobular Ca with 33 pos LN in 2059)
Result to Dr Gallwas via anaesthetist by A/Prof A Fieldhouse at 9:30am on 18/3/14.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of an ovary measuring 45 x 30 x 15mm with attached fallopian tube 40mm in length and up to 12mm in diameter.   Slicing the ovary reveals a lobular, solid cut surface with paleyellow and haemorrhagic areas.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative sections of the ovary; 3 - representative sections of the fallopian tube.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 55 x 35 x 4mm.  No nodules are identified.  AE 3 blocks.  
(TO: XO/ta 21/5/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Cocuzza): 
A & B.  Sections show metastatic lobular carcinoma widely involving both ovaries and tubes.  The malignant cells are arranged in sheets, nodules and cords.  Prominent intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles giving a 'signet ring' appearance are present.
The tumour is strongly positive for ER, negative for PR and shows 2+ Her2 staining.  (Material has been sent to AUGUSTA HOSPITAL Hospital for further Her2 studies).
C.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Metastatic lobular breast carcinoma involving both ovaries and tubes.
