CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrial cancer on curettings.
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by IX
A.  Specimen labelled "Bilateral ovaries + tubes, uterus + cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries 107g in total. The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 48mm and hasa smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 32mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The cervical soft tissue margin is inked blue anteriorly and black.  On sectioning there is a tan tumour within the endometrial cavity 75 x 55 x 25mm.  The tumour has a friable surface.  The myometrium is up to 27mm thick.  The left fallopian tube is 54mm in length and up to 9mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 35 x 25 x 13mm.  There are three cysts within the left ovary ranging from 5-14mm in maximum dimension.  All three cysts have smooth linings and are filled with clear fluid.  The right fallopian tube is 65mm in length and up to 65mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 44 x 25 x 22mm.  Slicing the right ovary reveals a multilocular cystic cut surface filled with clear fluid. There are no papillary excrescences.  
Blocks 1-4 - LS of anterior body and cervix (3 and 4 - paired); 5 - representative section tumour in relation to serosa, anterior; 6-8 - LS posterior body and cervix; 9 - section of tumour, reserve block for tumour bank; 10 - representative section tumour in relation to serosa, posterior; 11 & 12 - representative left ovary; 13 - representative left fallopian tube; 14 - representative right fallopian tube; 15-17 - representative right ovary. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal pannus", consists of two piecesof skin with subcutaneous fatty tissue 360 x 180 x 65mm and 240 x 30 x 85mm.  The skin surface appears unremarkable. There are no nodules within the subcutaneous tissue.  Block 1 - representative smaller piece; 2 - representative larger piece.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Hernia sac", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 140 x 100 x 15mm.  On one surface it is covered by a grey shiny membrane.  No nodules are present.  Blocks 1-3 - representative sections.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 80 x 40 x 15mm.  There are two lymph nodes 55 and 25mm in maximum dimension.  The cut surfaces of both lymph nodes are mostly replaced with adipose tissue.  Blocks 1-3 - one lymph node; 4-6 - one lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 55 x 35 x 20mm.  There are two lymph nodes 28 and 10mm in maximum dimension. Block  1- one bisected lymph node; 2 & 3 - comprise one lymph node. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of two fragments of fatty tissue 30 x 22 x 4mm in aggregate. A lymph node is not identified.  Serially sliced, AE in 1 block. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Right externaliliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 100 x 50 x 20mm.  There are two lymph nodes 48 and 30mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks 1 & 2 - comprise one lymph node;3-7 - comprise one lymph node. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 80 x 30 x 25mm.  There is an elongated lymph node 70mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks 1-4 - comprise one lymph node.  
I.   Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of fragments of fatty tissue 30 x 20 x 6mm in aggregate.  There is a lymph node 9mm in maximum dimension. Block 1- one lymph node. (YO/ec 15.11.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr G Hermenau):
A. Sections show an endometrioid adenocarcinoma. More than 50% of the tumour has a solid architecture, in keeping with a grade of 3. The solid component is composed of markedly pleomorphic tumour cells with focal areas of necrosis.  The remainder of the lesion has a glandular architecture, in keeping with endometrial differentiation.
The tumour involves the anterior and posterior uterine walls.
The maximal depth of invasion is in the anterior uterine wall, 16mm through a wall 27mm thick.
Lymphovascular invasion is present (x3 foci).
There is no evidence of invasion into the cervix.
Focal adenomyosis is seen in the myometrium.
The cervix is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
Simple cysts are present in the left ovary.
The right ovary shows a benign serous cystadenoma.
The fallopian tubes show no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show skin and underlying fat with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show fibrous hernial sac with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
F. Sections at multiple levels show fat with no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
H. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A to I. Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophrectomy, abdominal pannus,hernial sac, left external iliac, left obturator, left common iliac, right common iliac, right obturator and right common iliac lymph nodes:
- Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma
- Tumour invasion into the outer half of the uterine wall (16mm/27mm)
- Lymphovascular invasion present (x 3 foci)
- Cervix uninvolved
- 8 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
- Simple cysts left ovary
- Benign serous cystadenoma right ovary
- Abdominal pannus and hernial sac with no evidence of malignancy
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (4.12.62, Dr G Scheu):
This case was discussed at the Gynaecologic Oncology Multidisciplinary Meeting on 26.11.62 and concern wasraised about the relatively low number of lymph nodes.  Specimens D to I were therefore re-examined macroscopically and further blocks taken.
D.  Left external iliac:  One more small fatty node was found, no evidence of tumour.
E.  Left obturator:  One more small node was found, no evidence of tumour.
F.  Left common iliac:  No nodes found.
G.  Right external iliac:  One more small node was found, no evidence of tumour.
H.  Right obturator:  Several more small fatty nodes and pieces of node were found.  It isestimated that a further six small fatty nodes were found, no evidence of tumour.
I.  Rightcommon iliac:  No more nodes found.
New lymph node count:  17 nodes, all negative (0/17).
