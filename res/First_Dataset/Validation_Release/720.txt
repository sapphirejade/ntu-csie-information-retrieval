SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (15.8.63):


CLINICAL:
63 year old woman with complex ovarian mass and elevated CA125.  Laparotomy,TAH/ BSO/ omentectomy.  Tissue for frozen section.    
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary, rectosigmoid colon", consists of a segment of bowel 120 x 35 x 35mm with an adherent mass (ovary and tube) measuring 100 x 70 x 50mm.  The mass has a smooth outer surface.  On sectioning the mass has solid and cystic areas with tan papillary projections into the cystic spaces.  Other cystic areas are filled with blood stained serous fluid.  Tumour invades from the serosal aspect through the muscle layer of the bowel wall but the bowel mucosa is intact.    
Block 3 - margins of bowel; 4 & 5- section of bowel wall with tumour; 6-15 - representative tumour; 16 & 17 - presumed fallopian tube; 18 - reserve block. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Favour large cell carcinoma. Await paraffin for definitive. 
Result to Dr LANNY Causby by Drs U Sobania/U Wyre/U Perocho/U Shuemaker at 16:38pm on 18/3/13. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left tube and ovary", consists of a uterus received unopened informalin, with attached left fallopian tube and ovary, weighing 49g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 35 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 22mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 4mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 7mm at maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 25mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm. The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm in maximum diameter. There is also a stump of right fallopian tissue which measures 20 x 4mm.  
Blocks 1-3 - full LS through anterior body and cervix; 4-6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 - TS of left fallopian tube; 8 - fimbrial end of left fallopian tube; 9-12 - left ovary serially sectioned; 13 - right fallopian tube stump.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node", consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 50 x 20 x 5mm.  Block 1 - one lymph node; 2 - three lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac", consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 15 x 18 x 4mm.  AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node", consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 5mm.  Block 1 - one lymph node; 2 - two lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node. 
F.   Specimen labelled "High left paraortic lymph node", consists of one lymph node measuring 17 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Bowel donut",consists of an opened segment of bowel measuring 55mm in length x 7 x 5mm.  BAE 2 blocks.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of omentum measuring 320 x 45 x 5mm.  No tumour deposits are seen. Representative sections in 3 blocks. 
(GT/ec 21.5.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr U Mceady) 
A.  Sections ofthe ovarian mass show a moderately and poorly differentiated serous carcinoma, overall poorly differentiated.  The tumour consists of papillary structures and slit-like glands but also a significant component of solid trabeculae and sheets of cells.  The tumour cells are large with pleomorphic nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Tumour involves the surface of the mass at least focally.  Tumour is confirmed to invade the bowel wall through the muscle layer and into submucosa, but the mucosa is intact.  There is tumour present on the bowel serosa at one of the end resection margins.  Sections of the identified fallopian tube do not show any significant abnormality but there is some tumour present on part of the tube serosa.  
B.  Sectionsof the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Sections of the left ovary and tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the right fallopian tube stump are unremarkable.  
C.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
E.  Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
F.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
G.  Sections show unremarkable large intestinal wall. 
H.  Sections of omentum show no evidence of tumour.  There is some mild reactive mesothelial proliferation on part of the serosal surface.  (ec) 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Right tube and ovary, rectosigmoid colon:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of ovary.  Invasion through wall of attached rectosigmoid colon.  
B.   Uterus, left tube and ovary:  No abnormality seen. 
C.   Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
D.   Right common iliac node:  No tumour (0/1).
E.   Left external iliac nodes:  No tumour (0/4). 
F.   High left paraortic lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
G.  Bowel donut:  No abnormality seen. 
H.  Omentum:  No tumour. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (15.8.63):
A.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2,MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
