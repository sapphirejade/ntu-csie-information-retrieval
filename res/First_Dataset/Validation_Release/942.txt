Location:  CORONARYCARE UNIT-CONDOBOLIN DISTRICT HOSPITAL
DR EFRAIN Kamila GUCKIN
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
53yr old male.  Presents with headaches, ataxia.  MRI demonstrates multiplelesions in cerebellum.  Please do urgent frozen section intraoperatively.  ?Metastasis.  Smoker.  HTN.  Alcohol misuse.  Marijuana use.   
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tumour cerebellar" consists of two fragments of soft pale tan tissue up to 3mm in maximumdimension.  Two pieces taken in one piece taken for frozen section. 
Blocks: 1 - frozen section AE; 2 - remainder of tissue.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated large cell malignancy, favour metastasis. 
Result to Registrar by Dr K Allen and Dr K Dedaj at 2.30pm on 18/1/13.
(TO: RR; RR/ta  20/3/63) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior fossa tumour" consists of five to six fragments of tan/brown solid tissue 62 x 35 x 20mm in aggregate.
Blocks: 1 to 6 - representative sections (block 6 - reserve block).  70% of the specimen is blocked.   (TO: HM; HM/ta 23/3/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof K Reifel): 
A&B. Both specimens show similar features and consist of cerebellum infiltrated by sheets and cohesive nests of large cells with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is brisk and large areas of necrosis are present. While the overall appearance of the tumour is poorly differentiated,several foci of possible glandular differentiation are seen in the Diastase stain, consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
No melanin pigment is seen.  
Immunohistochemistry:
AE1/AE3 (broad spectrumcytokeratins), Cam5.2, CK19: positive
CK5/6: negative
CK7: patchy positivity
CK20: negative
CDX-2: positive
LCA: Tumour cells negative
P63: negative
Melan A, S100& HMB45: negative
CD45: negative
CD56, synaptophysin & chromogranin: negative
PSA: negative
Comment: The posterior fossa tumour is a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, favour adenocarcinoma. Melanoma and neuroendocrine markers are negative. PSA and TTF-1 negativity makes prostate and lung primaries unlikely, respectively.  CDX-2 is a marker of intestinal differentiation and can be seen in adenocarcinomas of GI tract, pancreas and biliary origin. CK7 positivity and CK20negativity makes an upper GI primary more likely. Correlation with clinical and radiologic findings is required.
DIAGNOSIS:
A&B. POSTERIOR FOSSA: METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA, FAVOUR ADENOCARCINOMA. SEE COMMENT
