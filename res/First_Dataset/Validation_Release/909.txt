CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass Ca 125 = 1205 Ca 15.3 = 88.  Previous history of TCC bladder.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic mass, right ovary" consists of a disrupted solid/cystic mass 75 x 70 x 55mm adjacent to ovary measuring 30 x 15 x 14mm with tube 60mm in length.  The cut surface shows mostly solid tumour with necrosis and haemorrhage.  Two representative sections for frozen section. 
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 9 - representative tumour; 10 - TS possible left tube; 11 - TS right tube; 12 - representative right ovary.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Phone result to gynaecology resident by Dr Q Caughorn at 10.10am on 2/1/13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left tube + ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 42g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 40 x 16mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 18 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is <1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 9mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium has a small ?papilloma up to 4mm diameter on the superior-anterior wall.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 6mm in maximal diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 13 x 14mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  There is a partial right fallopian tube present measuring 20mm in length and up to 10mm in maximal diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 - endometrial representative section with ?papilloma; 8 - right fallopian tube; 9 - representative left fallopian tube; 10 - representative LS left ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuringup to 65 x 48 x 5mm.  On sectioning, there are no tumour deposits identified.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.   (LJ/cc  3/5/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Guill):
A.  Sectionsshow a high grade carcinoma arranged in sheets, trabeculae and papillae containing fibrovascular cores, with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with pleomorphic nuclei containing coarse chromatin and small nucleoli.  Focally the tumour has a squamoid appearance and no glandular formation is seen.  Abundant mitoses are present.  The tumour lies adjacent and focally adherent to the ovary, which otherwise appears normal.  A section of normal fallopian tube is also identified.  The tumour shows strong positive staining with CK7, CA125 and WT1.  The CK20 and CK5/6 stains are negative.
COMMENT:
Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different.  The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6.  The CA125 stain is negative.
It is thus concluded that the current tumour may not represent a recurrence of urothelial carcinoma, but instead is favoured to represent a poorly differentiated mulleriancarcinoma.  As a normal ovary and fallopian tube are present, the tumour may be of peritoneal origin.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a small benign endometrial polyp.  The myometrium, fallopian tubes and left ovary show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
C.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
This case has been reviewed by Dr Q Ankersen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C:  Right pelvic mass, uterus and cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries, omentum:
- Favour poorly differentiated mullerian carcinoma (see comment)
- Possible peritoneal origin
- Omentum negative
ADDITIONAL REPORT (17/3/63):

Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins (block:  A5)
	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
