CLINICAL:
Right parotid tumour & neck dissection levels 2A, 2B, 3.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Parotidectomy (R) neck" consists of an irregular unorientated tissue mass measuring 93 x 61 x 27mm.  One surface of the specimen is fairly smooth and fatty, and the opposite surface is grey and more rough with a clip present.  The smooth fatty surface is inked green and the irregular grey surface is inked blue.  The specimen is serially transversely sectioned from the end closest to the suture clip into seventeen slices.  There is a firm white ill-defined lesion presentin slices 1 to 6 measuring up to 30 x 30 x 18mm.  The lesion appears to abut both the blue and green margins.  The remainder of the slices show uniform pale yellow tissue with some lymph nodes measuring up to 5mm in diameter identified.  The slices are embedded according to the attached diagram.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - slice 1; 5 - slice 2; 6 & 7 - slice 3; 8 & 9 - slice 4; 10 & 11 - slice 5; 12 & 13 - slice 6; 14 & 15 - slice 7; 16 - slice 8; 17 - slice 9 (bisected lymph node with block 16); 18 - slice 10 (bisected lymph node with block 17); 19 - slice 12; 20 - slice 14; 21 - slice 15 (bisected lymph node with block 20); 22 - one lymph node.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right neck external jugular" consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue ranging from 15 to 25mm.  The piece with the suture is embedded in block 1 (suture removed); other two pieces embedded in block 2.AE two blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Deep parotid node (right)" consists of one node with attached fatty tissue measuring 15 x 12 x 7mm.  TAE one block.   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right neck deep margin" consists of one unorientated triangular piece of fibrous tan tissue measuring 22 x15 x 5mm.  Serially sectioned, AE two blocks. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Level 2B lymph nodes (right side) neck" consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue measuring 30 x 23 x 8mm.  Serially sectioned, AE two blocks. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Level 2/level 3 lymph nodes right neck" consists ofan unorientated piece of fatty tissue containing lymph nodes measuring in total 80 x 40 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1 - one trisected node; 2 - five possible lymph nodes; 3 - six possible lymph nodes; 4 - six possible lymph nodes; 5 - four possible lymph nodes.  (EF/cc  9/3/63) 
 



MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Herner): 
A.  Sections show parotid tissue with a large deposit of moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, most consistent with a metastasis.  This is presumably originally been to a lymph node but the lymph node has now been almost completely replaced and there is extensive extranodal tumour spread.  Extranodal tumour is present withinthe parotid gland and also in surrounding soft tissue.  There are foci of lymphovascular invasion identified in the tumour, including invasion of one or two small muscular veins.  There are several nerves identified within the tumour but only focal perineural invasion is identified.    
Tumour extends extensively to the described irregular grey surface of the specimen (presumed deep margin).  Tumour is also present at oneend margin of the specimen, the presumed superiorend (Blocks 1 to 4).  Tumour is 0.5mm from the described smooth fatty surface of the specimen (presumed superficial surface).  Other margins appearfree of involvement.  
Twelve other intraparotid nodes were identified in the specimen and these are all free of tumour.
B.  Sections show fibrofat with small nerves and a small muscular vein.  No lymph nodes are seen.  No tumour is seen. 
C. Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.   
D.  Sections show parotid tissue and adjacent fibrofat.  One surface of the tissue (presumed superficial surface) is extensively involved by tumour.  The opposite surface (presumed true deep margin) appears to be involved by tumour focally. 
E.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
F.  Sections show seventeen lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.    
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Right parotid:  Metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive extranodal spread.
B.  Right neck external jugular:  No tumour.
C.  Right deep parotid node:  No tumour (0/1)
D.  Right neck deep margin:  Squamous cell carcinoma. 
E.  Level 2B lymph nodes right neck:  No tumour (0/3)
F.  Level 2 / level 3 lymph nodes right neck:  No tumour (0/17)
