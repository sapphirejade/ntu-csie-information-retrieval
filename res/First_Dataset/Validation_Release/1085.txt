Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Previous hysterectomy.  Peritoneal cancer, ascites. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  Laparotomy, omentectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.   
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an adherent fallopian tube and ovary covered with dull fibrous adhesions measuring 50 x 25 x 15mm in total.  The fallopian tube measures 75mm in length x 7 x6mm in maximum dimension.  The ovary measures 32 x 15 x 10mm.  There is an area of disruption through the fallopian tube measuring 5 x 5mm, 37mm from the fimbria end.  The ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The cut surface is unremarkable aside from a haemorrhagic filled cyst measuring 10 x 5 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1 - fallopian tube (fimbria end two TS, one LS); 2- four TS disrupted area; 3- one TS uterine end of fallopian tube; 4 & 5 - representative ovary (4 - three TS; 5- one TS).  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube with fibrofatty tissue and ovary measuring in total 50 x 40 x 25mm.  The fallopian tube is 35mm in length and 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  There is adherent mesentery and fibrous tissue to the fallopian tube.  The ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  The adherent fibrofatty tissue appears grey/tan with inflamed blood vessels.  
Blocks:  1 - fallopian tube three TS, one LS; 2 to 4 - representative ovary one TS each; 5 - adherent mass two TS.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Anterior peritoneum" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 10mm and 60 x 10 x 10mm.  On the first fragment there is a haemorrhagic hard area adherent to the fat over 10 x 10mm.  On the second fragment there is a pale fibrotic area measuring 10 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1 - first fragment; 2 & 3 - second fragment (block 2 - two TS through nodule).  
D.  Specimenlabelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 310 x 120 x 30mm.  The omentum contains a large fibrotic area over 120 x 100mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one TS in 3 blocks.  (JL/mm 18.7.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr R Picton):
A & B.  Sections show moderately differentiatedserous carcinoma involving the surface of both ovaries and tubes, paradnexal soft tissues, the parenchyma of the right ovary and adherent fat.
C.  Sections show several small deposits of serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, also involving the right ovary,surface of both ovaries and tubes, paradnexal soft tissue and peritoneum.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 10/1/63:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates alow likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
