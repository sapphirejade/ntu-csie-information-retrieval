CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma in situ.  Uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix + tube + ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left ovary and fallopian tube weighing 88g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 30mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny with a white plaque on the anterior surface measuring 10 x 8mm.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 3mm in maximum thickness over a total wall thickness of 18mm.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 8mm in maximum diameter.
Blocks:  1 to 11 - anterior cervix AE from right to left; 12 to 25 - posterior cervix AE from left to right; 26 & 27 - full LS through anterior uterine body; 28 & 29 - full LS through posterior uterine body; 30 & 31 - further representative posterior endometrium; 32 - two LS of the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube; 33 - two representative TS left fallopian tube; 34 & 35 - two representative TS leftovary; 36 - representative serosal plaque.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterine polyp" consists of a piece of dark tan polypoid tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: PO; ZC/rt 18.3.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Odeh):
A.  The entire cervix has been examined.  There is no residual adenocarcinoma in situ.  There is no HPV effect or CIN.  (Benign mesonephric remnants are noted in block 20).
The endometrium is proliferative.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left tube is unremarkable.  The left ovary shows cystic follicles.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show a benign endometrial polyp.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  No AIS, HPV or CIN.
B.  Endometrial polyp.
