H/o R) DCIS - WLE & XRT.  H/o L) IDC - WLE & SLNB.  BRCA 2(+) - bilat Tm.  Suture - short superior, long lateral.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "(R) breast tissue" consists of a mastectomy measuring 115 x 110 x 20mm, and weighing 116.8g.  There is an ellipseof skin including nipple on the surface measuring 50 x 32mm.  Sutures taken as described (short superior, long lateral).  There is a ?scar on the lateral aspect running from superior to inferior 15mm.  The deep margin is inked black, the superficial margin is inked blue and the superior margin is inked red.  Sectioning shows fibrofatty breast tissue.  Tissue embedded according to attached diagram.
Blocks:  1 - representative nipple; 2 - representative scar; 3 - tissue deep to nipple; 4 & 5 - representative upper outer quadrant; 6 & 7 - representative upper inner quadrant; 8 & 9 - representative lower inner quadrant; 10 & 11 - representative lower outer quadrant.
B.  Specimen labelled"(L) breast tissue, long lateral, short superior" consists of a mastectomy (sutures taken as described) measuring 126 x 108 x 18mm, and weighing 131g.  There is an ellipse of skinwith nipple measuring 81 x 22mm.  There is a small scar measuring up to 8mm from medial to lateral on the skin surface.  Sectioning shows diffuse fatty and extensive fibrotic breast tissue.  The deep margin is inked black, the superficialmargin is inked blue and the superior margin is inked red.
Blocks:  1 - representative nipple; 2 - representative scar; 3 - tissue deep to nipple; 4 & 5 - representative sections upper inner quadrant; 6 & 7 - representative sections upper outer quadrant; 8 & 9 - representative sections lower outer quadrant; 10 & 11 - representative sections lowerinner quadrant.
