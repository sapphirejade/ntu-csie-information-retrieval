(YE/mm 21.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr D Sumstad):
A. Sections show multiple fragments of mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The lesion is composed of glands and papillae lined by columnar tumour cells with marked nuclear atypia.  The tumour cells are floating in pools of mucin, in keeping with mucinous differentiation.  Blood and necro-inflammatory debris are also present.
B. Sections show fragments of skin with mucinous adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS
