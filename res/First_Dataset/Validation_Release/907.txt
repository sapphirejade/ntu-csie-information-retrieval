CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometroid cancer of endometrium.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes + ovaries" consistsof a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 108g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 40 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has a unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is a large polypoid mass arising from the posterosuperior aspect of the endometrium measuring 45 x 40 x 30mm.  There is also a small polyp 8 x 5 x 1mm present in the anterior endometrium.  On sectioning the tumour possibly invades the myometrium to a depth of 1mm, in the myometrium 12mm in thickness.  The tumour appears to involve left cornu (block 11 and 12) the right cornu appears unremarkable.  The fallopian tubes measure 50 x 7mm and 48 x 7mm right and left respectively.  Both fallopian tubes have been ligated previously.  The right ovary measures 22 x 15 x 12mm and show no unusual features.  The solid left ovary measures 15 x 15 x 12mm showing no unusual features on sectioning.  The anterior cervix is inked blue and the posterior black.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 10 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix including tumour and deepest invasion; 11 & 12 -  left cornea; 13 - right parametrial; 14 - left parametrial; 15 - right adnexa; 16 - left adnexa; 17 - reserve block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Rightexternal iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 85 x 60 x 20mmand 80 x 20 x 10mm containing several nodes measuring from 5mm to 40mm.  
Blocks: 1 - three nodes; 2 - three nodes; 3 to 5 - the largest node.  
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of several pieces of fibrofatty tissue together measuring 65 x 35 x 10mm containing several nodes ranging from 10mm to 35mm.  
Blocks: 1 - two nodes; 2 - one node bisected; 3 & 4 - the largest node.  
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac node lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x 20 x 9mm containing a 12mm lymph node.  AE
Blocks: 1 - lymph node; 2 - remaining tissue.  
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue and blood clot together measuring 25 x 18 x 6mm.  AE 1 block.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of several piece of fibroadipose tissue ranging from 15 to 80mm in greatest dimension with an aggregate measurement of 80 x 70 x 20mm containing several nodes ranging from 3mm to 35mm in greatest dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - two nodes; 2 - ? nodes; 3 - one node trisected; 4 to 6 - the largest node.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of two nodes 12 and 30mm in greatest dimension. 
Blocks: 1 - one node; 2 & 3 - the larger node.  (TO: CY; QF/ta 22/1/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Westerhoff): 
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 1.5mm through a wall 14mm thick.  A single focus of lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One lymph node shows noevidence of malignancy.
E.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 1.5mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.  Twenty (20) lymph nodes are negative.
