CLINICAL:
Recurrent sarcoma R elbow -amputation. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right upper limb", consists of a left arm amputation consisting of the hand, forearm and proximal arm measuring in length 150mm.  At the level of the elbow there is a nodular area covered by intact skin.  On sectioning there is a large solid and fleshy tumour measuring 50 x 50 x 70mm.  Tumour appears partly encapsulated and appears to invade the adjacent muscle and adipose tissue. The tumour is located 70mm from the surgical margin.  Apart from the tumour there is a large ovoid scar in the radial aspect of the arm measuring 70 x 50mm.  
Block 1- vascular resection margin; 2 - resection margin of main nerves and tendons; 3 - bone marrow curettage from resection margin of humerus; 4 & 5 -representative sections of skeletal muscle surgical margin; 6 - surgical margin of adipose tissue and skin; 7 - shave of humerus surgical margin; 8-14 - representative sections of tumour; 15 - one representative section of the arm scar; 16 - representative section of old scar.  (GG/ec 29.5.63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Felps & Dr T Stoudemire): 
Sections show a high grade infiltrative tumour composed of plump spindle cells arranged in sheets and vague fascicles.  The tumour cells show moderate to high grade atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.  Mitoses are frequent (up to 17 mitoses /10HPF).   Small foci of necrosis are also seen.  The tumour infiltrates skeletal muscle fibres and subcutaneous adipose tissue.  The morphological features are similar to the previous excision (72T27357) and are in keeping with the previous diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.  The surgical margins are well clear of tumour.


DIAGNOSIS:
Right upper limb:
- Recurrent undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. 
- Margins well clear.
