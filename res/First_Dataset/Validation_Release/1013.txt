CLINICAL:
Recurrent ovarian Ca.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Transverse colon" consists of a segment of colon 95mm in length, 75mm in maximum open circumference with attached mesocolon, 70 x 50 x 15mm.  The segment of colon appears unremarkable.  There are multiple nodules present in the mesocolon measuring 35 x 25 x 10mm to 10 x 5 x 5mm.  Two smaller nodules are present on the serosal surface.  The surface of the two smaller nodules is roughened at one aspect and this aspect is inked blue.  There is no involvement of the colon.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 -two nodules (one in each); 3 - three lymph nodes; 4 - two lymph nodes; 5 to 9 - largest nodule; 10 & 11 - representative section of the colon.
B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel mesentery" consists of multiple fragments of pale tissue, 15 x 10 x 3mm in total aggregate.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum 280 x 150 x 15mm.  Multiple tumour deposits are noted ranging from 8mm across to 90mm across.  
Blocks:  1 - three nodes; 2 - three nodes; 3 - two nodes; 4 & 5 - representative section from two nodes one in each; 6 - one representative section of the largest node.  (CD/mm 28.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Hargreaves):
A.  Sections show multiple deposits of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma involving transverse colon mesentery.  The tumour shows prominent papillary architecture.  There is widespread psammoma body type calcification.  The muscle wall and mucosa of transverse colon are unremarkable.
B & C.  Sections show multiple deposits of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma involving smallbowel mesentery and omentum.  The tumour shows similar appearances to those described in the specimen A.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Transverse colon - Metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma.
B.  Small bowel mesentery - Metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma.
C.  Omentum - Metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma.
