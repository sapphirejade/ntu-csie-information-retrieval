CLINICAL:
Serous carcinoma on FNA.  Asymptomatic but elevated Ca 125 on screening after brother died age 49 of duodenal cancer.  Premature menopause age 45 on HRT.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 102g in total.  The uterus measures85 x 60 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium is uneven, however no definite malignancy or tumour mass is identified.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 28mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is trabeculated with a foci of adenomyosis.  The right ovary measures 28 x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is covered with haemorrhage and measures 52mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 25 x 10 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left ovary is congested and is 50mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  Both fallopian tubes and ovaries are AE.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - right ovary AE; 9 to 11 - right fallopian tube AE; 12 & 13 - left ovary AE; 14 to 16 - left fallopian tube AE.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 500 x 120 x 30mm.  There is a well circumscribed pale cream nodule adherent to one area of omentum over 40 x 35 x 35mm.  The cut surface of the omental nodule reveals nodular soft areas of cream tumour.  The tumour appears to infiltrate within the omentum.  No other masses are found within the omental tissue.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - tumour; 4 - reserve block for tumour bank.
C.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas" consists of a fibrofatty piece oftissue with a smooth membranous surface on one side measuring 20 x 20 x 7mm.  On the smooth surface there are two nodular tan areas measuring 4 and 5mm in maximum dimension.  The opposite surface is disrupted and congested.  Serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.   (UG/ta 24/3/64) 
   
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Frittz): 
A.  The ectocervixand endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium shows progestational effect.  The myometrium shows adenomyosis.  There is a tiny surface deposit of serous carcinoma on the surface of the right ovary.
The left ovaryis unremarkable.  The left tube shows focal serous carcinoma involving the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis.  The right tube is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show moderately and poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving the omentum.
C.  Sections show deposits of serous carcinoma.
  
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, and also involving the left tube, surface of the right ovary and Pouch of Douglas.
