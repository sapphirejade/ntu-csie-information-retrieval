Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Frozen section - perineal biopsy prior to surgery.  Previous biopsy showed hyperkeratosis only, butnow appears ulcerated.  Known SCC and VIN on vulva.  SCC vulva/clitoris - peripheral.  Lymph node dissection prior to vulvectomy.  66 yr old woman with biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of vulva.  Had radical anterior vulvectomy, removal of ulcerated perineal lesion, bilateral groin node dissection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Perineal biopsy frozen" consists of a piece of tissue with overlying mucosa 8 x 8mm to a depth of 5mm.  Bisected AE for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section AE.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis.  No diagnostic evidence of VIN. 
Phone result to Prof Kreighbaum by Prof S Hoppins at 12.37am on 07.08.13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node frozen" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 50 and 30mm.  Three lymph nodes are identified.  Node 1is 30mm, node 2 18mm and node 3 15mm.  Frozen section 1 was one TS of lymph node 1, frozen section 2 with a LS of both node 2 and node 3, frozen section 3 was a further TS of lymph node 1.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section 1; 2- frozen section 2; 3 -frozen section 3; 4 & 5 - remainder of lymph node 1 AE; 6 - remainder of lymph node 2 AE; 7- remainder of lymph node 3 AE; 8 - ?further lymph node.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy in threelymph nodes.
Phone report to Prof Koning/Randal by Prof Gulden at 1.05pm on 07.08.13.
C.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulva" consists of a vulva 115 x 70mm to a depth of 20mm.  The left margin is inked blue, the right margin is inked black and the posterior margin is inked red.  In the centre of the skin there is a raised puckered area measuring 45 x 22mm which appears to come within 12mm of the posterior margin and well clear of the anterior left and right margins.  The deep margin appears disrupted in several areas.  
Blocks:  1 - LS of anterior margin; 2 to 14 - serial transverse sections from left to right (paired blocks 2&3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 & 11, 12 to 14); 15 to 23 - LSof posterior margin from right to left.  Please refer to attached diagram.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 60 x 45 x 20mm.  One lymph node 30mm is identified.  Onefurther ?lymph node is identified 3mm.  
Blocks:  1- ?lymph node; 2 to 4 - large lymph node serially sectioned.  AE.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral inguinal lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 40 and 55mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 3 to 24mm.  
Blocks:  1- ?lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected; 3 - one lymph node bisected; 4 to 5 - one lymph node serially sectioned.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Leftfemoral lymph node" consists of one definite node 8mm.  
Blocks:  1- lymph node bisected; 2 & 3 - remainder of tissue.  AE.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node" consists of three fragments of fatty tissue 30 to 50mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 8 to 25mm. 
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one lymph node bisected; 3 - ?lymph nodes.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral inguinal lymph node" consists of two pieces of fattytissue 40 and 45mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 3 to 18mm.  One lymph node was received with incision made through it.  
Blocks:  1 - lymph nodes; 2- lymph node bisected which was received incised; 3 & 4 - one lymph nodeBAE. 
I.  Specimen labelled "Perineal lesion" consists of an unorientated ellipse of mucosa 25 x 6mm to a depth of 8mm.  The mucosa appears disrupted with a ?site of previous biopsy.  Specimen is serially transverse sectionedand AE 3 blocks (block 1 - ends).  (TO:  UK: IS/mm 10.10.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Wojenski) 
A.  Sections show no evidence of VIN or malignancy.
B.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, depth 7mm, width 15mm, length approximately 25mm.Focal lymphatic invasion is seen.  A small amount of adjacent differentiated VIN is seen.  The margins are well clear (>10mm) of carcinoma and VIN.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Sections show ulceration, ortho and parakeratosis, and acanthosis, but no evidence of VIN or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, depth 7mm, width 15mm, approximate length 25mm.  Well clear of all margins.  Thirteen (13) lymph nodes are negative.
