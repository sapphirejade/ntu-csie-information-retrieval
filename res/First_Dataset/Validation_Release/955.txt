Location:  IMVS-MOUNT ISA  HOSPITAL
DR Ernesto Dewitt Feuss
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Sigmoidal cancer high anterior resection.  Sigmoid ca.  Distal doughnut.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Colon anterior resection" consistsof a segment of large bowel measuring 150mm in length and 30mm in maximum diameter.  The entire specimen is above the peritoneal reflection.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  In the mucosal surface there is a circumferential ulcerated tumour with exophytic margins measuring 50mm in maximal diameter.  The tumour is located 50mm from one of the surgical margins and 60mm from the opposite surgical margin.  No other lesions are identified.  The sectionmargins are inked black and blue.
Blocks:  1 - resection margins LS; 2 & 3 - tumour; 4 to 6 - composite of a full TS of the tumour; 7 & 8 - tumour with normal colon; 9 - apical node; 10 to 12 - lymph nodes (A5 reserved block).
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a small donut of colon 10mm in diameter, 4mm in thickness.  AE1 block.

Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  50mm
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not applicable
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  22
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
- The specimen 2 (distal donut) shows normal appearing colonic tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Not applicable
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining/
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates alow likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The block best for molecular genetic testing is:  A4
