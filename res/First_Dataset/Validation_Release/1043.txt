CLINICAL:
Endometrialcancer.  IDDM, N/stemi Feb 12 x3 stents.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" The specimen is received partly opened and consists of a uterus with attached cervix. The uterus measures 120 x 85 x 65mm and weighs 248g.    The serosal surface is smooth and shiny. 
The cervix measures 20x20mm.  In the endometrial cavity there is an exophytic and fungating white fleshytumour involving the entire endometrium and extending down into the endocervix.  The tumour has a maximum thickness of 20mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 35mm.  At the level of the endocervix the tumour is haemorrhagic andnecrotic.  
Blocks:  1 to 7 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 8 to 11 - four representative sections of anterior endo/myometrium; 12 to 17 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 18 & 19 - two representative sections of posterior endo/myometrium; 20 - one representative section of posterior endocervix and exocervix with tumour; 21 - tumour for tissue banking; 22 - right cornu; 23 - right fallopian tube; 24 - left cornu; 25 - left fallopian tube; 26 - right parametrial tissue; 27 - left parametrial tissue.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 60 x 50 x 30mm with six lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 40mm in maximum diameter.  Macroscopically the largest lymph node has a nodular clear area ?metastases measuring 15 x 10mm.
Blocks:  1 - one full longitudinal section of largest lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one bisected lymph node; 4 - three lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator" consists of a lymph node 45 x 15 x 10mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  AE.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph node; 3 - rest of adipose tissue.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 70 x 50 x 30mm with six lymph nodes ranging from 10 to 25mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 to 5 - one bisected lymph node each; 6 - twolymph nodes.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40 x 30 x 10mm with four lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 70mm in maximum diameter.  On sectioning, there is no evidence of tumour.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - largest lymph node; 5 - one bisected lymph node; 6 - two lymph nodes.   (PG/cc 29/11/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Magdefrau):
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 9mm through a wall 20mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The tumour extends to involve the upper endocervical stroma.  No ectocervical squamous epithelium is included.  The tumour is well clear of the cervical/vaginal surgical margin.
Both fallopian tubes are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The ovaries are not included.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins are pending.
B.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcnoma of the endometrium, maximum depth of invasion 9mm through a wall 20mm thick.  Upper endocervical stromal involvement present.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Twenty (20) lymph nodes are negative.  
ADDITIONAL REPORT 6/12/62:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
