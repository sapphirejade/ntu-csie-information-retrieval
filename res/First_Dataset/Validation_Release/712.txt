CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, ? ovarian carcinoma.  CA 125 +683.  CA 19.9 = 476.  CEA = 2.1.  
BHCG <1.  AFP = 1.   Right ovarian mass.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of an ovary with an intact surface 110 x 90 x 80mm and an attached fallopian tube 40 x 10mm. A 6mm parafimbrial cyst is present. The cut surface of the mass shows solid light tan tumour.  Two slices for FS.  
Block 1- FS block 1, AE; 2 - FS block 2, AE; 3-11 - further representative tumour; 12 - tumour reserve block; 13 - representative fallopian tube. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Adenocarcinoma, favour clear cell. 
Result to Gynae registrar by Dr K Prevento at 16:45 on 12.12.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac", consists of multiple pieces of fibroadipose tissue 50 x 40 x 10mm in aggregate.  
Block 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph nodes",consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 40 x 25 x 15mm in aggregate.
Block 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - lymph nodes; 3 - lymph nodes. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes", consists of fibroadipose tissue 50 x 33 x 10mm.  
Block 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - lymph nodes.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall", consists of a 13mm piece of fibroadipose tissue. TS, AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left ovarian biopsy", consists of two pieces of serosa-covered ovarian tissue 14 x 8 x 6mm and 20 x 8 x 4mm.  
TS, AE 2 blocks (smaller piece in block 1, larger piece in block 2). 
G.  Specimen labelled "Left fimbrial cyst", consists of a 15 x 7 x 7mm cyst with a smooth surface attached to a 7mm stalk.  On sectioning the cyst contains clear fluid and has a smooth internal surface.BAE 1 block. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Para-aortic lymph node", consists of two pieces of haemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue 40 x 15 x 12mm.   
Block 1 - one lymph node TS, AE; 2 - one lymph node TS, AE; 3 - one lymph node bisected. 
I.   Specimen labelled "Infundibulum pelvic infundibulopelvic ligament", consists of a 20mm piece of fibroadipose tissue.  TS, AE 1 block. 
J.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid tent", consists of a 25mm piece of fibroadipose tissue. TS, AE 1 block. 
K. Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists of avermiform appendix 65mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The wall measures 2mm in thickness and the lumen contains faecal material.  
Block 1 - distal; 2 - mid; 3 - proximal.  Specimen AE.
L.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of two pieces of macroscopically unremarkable omental tissue 110 x 75 x 10mm and 280 x 120 x 10mm.  Representative 3 blocks.   (TO: LH;WE/ec 15.2.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr K Maslonka)
A.  Sections of the ovary show a clear cell carcinoma.  This consists of irregular glands and small cysts which are lined by atypical epithelial cells with large, irregular nuclei and clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Foci of multilayered atypical epithelium and small foci of solid and papillary tumour are also noted.  There is some tumour necrosis.  No tumour is seen on the surface of the ovary.  Sections of the fallopiantube are unremarkable.  No endometriosis is seen. 

B.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
C.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour isseen. 
D.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
E.  Sections show mesothelium with underlying fibrofat.  No abnormality is seen.
F.  Sections show ovarian tissue.  No significant abnormality is seen. 
G.  Sections show a thin walled cyst lined by normal simple columnar epithelium.
H.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
I.  Sections show mesothelium with underlying fibrofat.  There is focal endosalpingiosis.No tumour is seen.
J.  Sections show mesothelium with underlying fat.  No abnormality is seen. 
K.  Sections show a normal appendix.  No tumour is seen.
L.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.    
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Right ovary and fallopian tube:  Clear cell carcinoma of ovary. 

B.  Right external iliac:  No tumour (0/5).  
C.  Right common iliac:  No tumour (0/6).
D.  Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
E.  Left pelvic side wall:   No abnormality seen. 
F.Left ovarian biopsy:  No abnormality seen. 
G.  Left fimbrial cyst
H.  Para-aortic lymph nodes:   No tumour (0/3). 
I.  Infundibulopelvic ligament:  Focal endosalpingiosis. 
J.  Sigmoid tent:  No tumour.
K.  Appendix:  No abnormality seen. 
L.  Omentum:  No tumour.  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.9.63):
A.  Immunostainshave been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
