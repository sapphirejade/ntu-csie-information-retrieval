CLINICAL:
2 years perimenopausal bleeding.  Uterine mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes & ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries which was received opened and weighing 487g.  The uterus measures 120 x 90 x 65mm and over the anterior serosal surface there are several cream and haemorrhagic areas identified.  The ectocervix measures 28 x 28mm and is unremarkable.  Upon opening, the uterus has a roughened, cream raised tumour which occupies almost the entire uterine cavity.  It measures 80 x 75mm anteriorly and 90 x 80mm posteriorly.  Anteriorly the cream tumour invades to the serosal surface to a maximum depth of 35mm over a total wall thickness of 35mm.  Posteriorly the tumour invades to a depth of 32mm over a maximal thickness of 37mm.  Several small fibroids are identified in the myometrium, up to 27mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 10mm. The right ovary measures 32 x 20 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in lengthwith a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 18 x 12mm and has a cystic area 10mm diameter.  
Blocks 1-8 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (paired blocks 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8); 9-16- full LS of posterior body and cervix (paired blocks 11 & 12, 13 & 14, 15 & 16); 17-20 - further representative sections of posterior uterus (paired blocks 18 & 19);  21 - further anterior uterus with tumour to serosal surface; 22 - right tube; 23 - right ovary; 24 - left tube; 25 - left ovary; 26 - reserve block.      
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of two pieces of tan and fatty tissue 6 and 14mm. AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists ofan appendix 50mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  A large amount of mesoappendix is included, measuring 80 x 45 x 25mm. The serosa is unremarkable apart from a slightly haemorrhagic and nodular area near the tip.  The lumen is obliterated for the majority of the specimen.  Block 1 - tip; 2 - mid third; 3 - shave resection margin proximal third. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of omentum 90 x 70 x 18mm.  No suspicious lesions are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Todora)  
A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Much of the tumour has a solid growth pattern and much of it shows high grade cytologicatypia.  Some squamous differentiation is noted.  There is patchy tumour necrosis.  No definite components of serous or clear cell carcinoma are identified.  Tumour invades through the full thickness of the myometrium on the anterior wall.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 35mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 35mm.  There is some adherent fibrofat on the serosal surface and tumour reaches this adherent tissue, however no tumour is identified on the serosal surface.  There is prominent, multifocal lymphovascular invasionin the myometrium.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the fallopian tubes and the right ovary are unremarkable.  The described cyst in the left ovary is a simple cyst.
B.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
C.  Sections of appendix show no significant abnormality.
D.Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.  (ec)   
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing full thickness myometrial invasion. Stage 1B. 
B.   Right external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1). 

C.   Appendix:  No significant abnormality. 
D.   Omental biopsy:  No tumour. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.8.63):
A.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MSH2: Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Loss of nuclear staining.
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI) and may reflect a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
