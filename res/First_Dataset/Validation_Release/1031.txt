CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  
1.  Pelvic washings.  
2.  Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries" consists of a uterus,cervix with attached bilateral ovary and tubes weighing 87g in total. The uterus measures 85 x 65 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has unremarkable surface. On sectioning, the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 50mm in maximum thickness.  There is an exophytic pale tumour located at the fundus at the right side of the uterus involving both anterior and posterior wall measuring 18 x 8 x 8mm.  There are multiple fibroids ranging from 10mm in diameterto 20mm in diameter.  There is extensive calcification involving the fibroids.   The right fallopian tube with fimbrial measures 65mm in length, 5mm in maximum external dimension.  The right ovary measures 34 x 16 x 7mm and has an unremarkable surface. The left fallopian tube and fimbrial measures 70mm in length, 8mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 45 x 15 x 6mm and has an unremarkable surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - parasagittal section of mid portion of anterior aspect of the uterus and cervix; 4 to 14 - sections of the tumour (4 & 5 - paired, 6 & 7 - paired; 8 & 9 - paired; 10 & 11 - paired; 12 & 13 - paired); 15 - corneum of the right side; 16 to 18 - midline LS posterior uterus and cervix; 19 to 24 - post sagittal sections posterior uterus with tumour (19 & 20 - paired, 21 & 22 paired); 25 - right ovary and tube; 26 -left ovary and tube.  (TO: ZW/ta 27/5/64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Engard)
Sections of the uterine tumour show a Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded glands, some of which have a cribriform morphology, lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). The carcinoma extends 2.2mm into a uterine wall 12mm thick. There is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. The carcinoma does not involve the sampled uterine cornua.
The non-neoplastic endometrium shows patchy atypical complex endometrial hyperplasia. There iswidespread adenomyosis and scattered benign leiomyomas. The uterine cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus: FIGO Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.


SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr W Raub, 6.4.64)
Immunoperoxidase stains for Mismatch Repair Protein status was requested at the Gynaecology Tumour Board meeting on 5.3.64.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining (weak focal staining in tumour cells)
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining (weak focal staining in tumour cells)
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Strong expression of MLH1 and PMS2 antigens is seen in non malignant endometrial glands.
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 orMSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a lowlikelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
