***AMENDED REPORT: Additional blocks for specimen A
Dr Z Silveira (17.3.2063)

CLINICAL:
Recurrent leiomyosarcoma. Laparotomy, radical vaginectomy, omental biopsies. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior abdominal wall mass", consists of a 112 x 14mm skin ellipse bearing a 95mm horizontal scar attached to subcutaneous fat anda small amount of skeletal muscle measuring 140 x 35 x 45mm.  No orientation is provided.  Sectioning reveals a well circumscribed nodular tumour at the fat/skeletal muscle interface measuring 35 x 30 x 14mm. The tumour appears to abut the lateral soft tissue margins and measures 13mm from the deep margin. The tumour measures 13mm from skin and is deep to scar.  The margins at the poles appear macroscopically well clear.  
Blocks 1-4 - full face TS through lesion (2/3 paired); 5 - tumour and lateral soft tissue margin; 6 - representative deep margin; 7 & 8 - additional blocks; 9 - tumour reserve block.

B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 35 x 20 x 15mm.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node TS AE; 2 - one lymph node TS AE
C.  Specimen labelled "Right iliac fossa mass", consists of a tumour nodule 55 x 40 x 30mm.
Blocks: 1-2 - representativetissue; 3 - tumour reserve block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left anterior abdominal wall", consists of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 30 x 20 x 15mm containing a 7mm tumour nodule on sectioning.  Representative 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel", consists of an 18 x 11 x 9mm tumour nodule with a small amount of attached fibroadipose tissue.  
Blocks: 1 - representative tissue; 2 - tumour reserve block.

MICROSCOPIC:(Reported by Dr Z Babson)
A.  Sections are of skin extending to deep subcutis, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. The 35mm tumour is aleiomyosarcoma. The leiomyosarcoma is composed of moderately pleomorphic malignant spindled cells arranged intersecting fascicles, with increased mitotic activity (up to 30 mitoses/10 hpf) and areas of necrosis. The tumour is 2mm from the deep margin and 1.6mm from the peripheral margin. Immunohistochemical stains show typical SMA and desmin positivity, as well as, focal CD10 positivity. A KI-67 highlights up to 95% of tumour cell nuclei.
B.  Sections of the two right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/2). 
C.  The 55mm right iliac fossa mass is a malignant spindle cell tumour. The morphology is similar to the anterior abdominal wall tumour and is consistent with a leiomyosarcoma. The degree of cytologic atypia appears greater within this right iliac fossa tumour. The tumour is partially surrounded by a thin cuff of fibrocollagenous tissue, but focally abuts the inked margin. 
D.  Theleft anterior abdominal wall tumour is a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with leiomyosarcoma. The appearance is similar to the previously described abdominal wall and right iliac fossa tumours. The tumour deposit is surrounded by a variably thick rim of fibrocollagenous tissue and is focally less than 0.1mm from the inked margin.
E.  Sections of the small bowel tumour show a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent withleiomyosarcoma. The tumour is largely fragmented and appears focally attached to the outer muscularis mucosa/serosa of the small bowel. The small bowel mucosa and submucosa show no significant histologic abnormality. The tumour is extensively fragmented after processing and accurate assessment of margins is difficult.
COMMENT:
ER and PR immuno-histochemistry was requested and the results are as follows:
- Block A5: ER positive (80% predominantly moderate); PR negative (<1%).
- Block C2: ER positive (75% moderate to strong); PR negative.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Anterior abdominal wall mass: 
Leiomyosarcoma, close to peripheral margin (1.6mm).
ER Positive; PR negative.

B.  Right external iliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy in two lymph nodes (0/2). 

C.  Right iliac fossa mass: Leiomyosarcoma, present at margins. 

D.  Left anterior abdominal wall: Leiomyosarcoma, focally less than 0.1mm from the inked margins. 

E.  Small bowel: Leiomyosarcoma.
