CLINICAL:
Recurrent ovarian cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall", consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue, unoriented, measuring 50 x 50 x 20mm.  The external surface is inked blue.  On sectioning there is a white, firm nodular area measuring 30 x 20 x 20mm.  
Blocks 1-3 - one full TS of the specimen; 4 & 5- two representative sections from the nodule; 6 & 7 - composite representative section of the nodule; 8 - one block of tumour for tumour bank. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 20mm.  On sectioning three lymph nodesare identified, one of them with a ? tumour deposit.  Apart from this, another lymph node is identified measuring 20 x 5 x 5mm.  Block 1 & 2- bisected group of lymph nodes; 3 - one bisected lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Coeliac axis lymph node", consists of a nodular piece of tissue measuring 45 x 40 x 10mm.  The cut surface is white and solid. Three representative sections of the nodule in 3 blocks.  (KS/ec 8.8.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Bergsman) 
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
B.  One of five lymph nodes shows metastatic serous carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
C.  One lymph node shows metastatic serous carcinoma.  Extensive extracapsular spread is present.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the left pelvic side walland two of six lymph nodes.
