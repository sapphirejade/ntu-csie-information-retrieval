CLINICAL:
Tumour.  Healthy.  Right paracaval tumour including attached segment of IVC.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Tumour right upper quadrant" consists of an encapsulated and lobulated piece of firm cream to grey tissue measuring 100 x 80 x 75mm and weighing 305.6g.  A portion of vessel wall is attached along one aspect covering an area of 20 x 20mm.  The cut surface shows diffuse firm cream tumour with a whorled appearance.  The tumour abuts the surgical margins.  Situated in the centre of the tumour there are several foci of partly haemorrhagic necrotic areas measuring up to 10 x 6mm. 
Blocks: 1 to 5 - tumour to blood vessel; 6 to 8 - tumour to surgical margin; 9 to 11 - tumour with haemorrhagic/necrotic areas; 12 - research block.  (LR/ta 26/11/62) 

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr R Nelon):
Sections show a high grade spindle cell tumour with cells arranged in broad sweeping fascicles.  Areas of coagulative necrosis and old haemorrhage are present.  Bizarre nuclear forms and abundant mitoses are present.  The tumour cells show positive staining with SMA and Desmin consistentwith a leiomyosarcoma.  The Ki67 index is approximately 40%.  
There is invasion of the wall of the inferior vena cava with tumour bulging into the lumen and breech of the endothelial cell layer.  It is difficult to determine whether this is a primary tumour of the inferior vena cava or metastatic disease.  Although the tumour has a well circumscribed edge which in most places has a thin rim of surrounding connective tissue, tumour extends to the inkedresection margin.
DIAGNOSIS:  
Right paracaval tumour:  Leiomyosarcoma
