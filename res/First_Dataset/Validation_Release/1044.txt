CLINICAL:
Complex atypical hyperplasia, post menopausal bleeding, previous endodermal sinus tumour of left ovary. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix", consists of  a uterus with attached cervix weighing 76g in total.The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 35mm. There are foci of fibrous adhesions on the uterine serosa. The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and appears focally indurated anteriorly over an area of 15 x 5mm. Arising fromthe anterior endometrium there is an endometrial polyp measuring 25 x 20 x 12mm. On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximal thickness while the myometrium is 20mm in maximalthickness. The myometrium is unremarkable. Representative sections in 32 blocks.
Blocks 1-5 - full LS anterior body and cervix (4 & 5 - paired blocks); 6-18 - remaining anterior endometrium, AE (12 & 13, 15 & 16 - paired blocks); 19-22 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 23-32 - remaining posterior endometrium, AE. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a lobulated and partly fluctuant grey mass measuring 60 x 40 x 30mm. There are several foci of fibrous adhesions on its external surface. The cut surface shows several unilocular cysts measuring up to 25mm across containing serous straw coloured to thick tan material. The inner lining of most of the cyst appears smooth.  No obvious fallopian tube is identified macroscopically.  AE in 18 blocks.  (TO: MK;SZ/ec 19.2.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr H Bjorkman)
A. Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, confined to the endometrium (pT1a).  
The lesion has a complex glandular architecture, with back-to-back glands lined by columnar tumour cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia.  Tumour forming cribriform spaces and micropapillae are also present.  There is no evidence of a significant solid component or severe cytologic atypia present.
The lesion is arising from a background of atypical complex hyperplasia.
A small benign leiomyoma is also present.
The cervix shows no evidence of human papilloma virus effect, dysplasia or malignancy.
Representative sections shown to Dr Lera BERGFALK and Dr Everett Bressman.
B. Sections marked dilatation of the fallopian tube, suggestive of a hydrosalpinx.
Simple cysts and cystic follicles are present in the ovary.  
There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus and cervix:
- Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, confined to the endometrium (pT1a)
- Background atypical complex hyperplasia
B. Right fallopian tube and ovary:
- Changes suggestive of a right hyposalpinx
- Simple cysts and cystic follicles in right ovary
