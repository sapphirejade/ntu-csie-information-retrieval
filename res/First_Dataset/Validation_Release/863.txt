CLINICAL:
Small bowel tumour with mets.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel", consists of one unopened segment of bowel measuring 300mm in length and up to 28mm in diameter.  There is mesentery attached measuring up to 30mm.  There is a contraction in the serosaapproximately 20mm from one end.  The serosal surface is smooth ranging from pale to dusky purple.  On opening the section of bowel there is a tumour present measuring 20mm from one of the ends. It is at the area of stricture of the serosa. The tumour measures 17 x 12mm.  It is pale, firm and fungating.  The remainder of the bowel mucosa is unremarkable.
Block 1 - TS surgical margin closest to tumour; 2 - surgical margin of otherend; 3 - LS tumour to margin staples removed; 4-7 - TS tumour (block 6 reserve block); 8 - representative bowel; 9 - representative bowel, LS; 10-16 - lymph nodes/mesenteric fat.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consistsof one piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 70 x 90 x 25mm. There are tumour deposits on one of the surfaces. The specimen measures in aggregate 35 x 30mm. There are tumour deposits ranging from 3mm up to thelargest measuring 50mm.  It is estimated there is approximately 50% tumour deposit in the omentum specimen.  
Block 1 - 3 representative small deposits; 2 & 3- representative sections of largest deposit. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Peritoneal nodule", consists of one fibrofatty nodule measuring 12 x 8 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.   (VN/ec  1.12.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr G Bugna): 
A.  Sections of small bowel show a tumour which ulcerates overlying epithelium.  The cells are uniform in nature with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with granular chromatin and small indistinct nucleoli.  The tumourcells show positive staining with CD56 and are negative for CK20 and TTF1.  The features are that of a neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid).  The mitotic count is approximately 6 per 10HPF and the Ki67 is approximately 15%.  The tumour is thus classified as a neuroendocrine tumour G2 (NET G2, WHO 2010 classification).  The tumour extensively infiltrates muscularis propria and extends into subserosal and mesenteric adipose tissue.  No definite peritoneal surface involvement is seen.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  The tumour lies approximately 20mm from the closest resection margin.  Due to the small amount of attached mesentery, no lymph nodes are identified, however there is extensive infiltration of mesenteric adipose tissue by tumour.  The remaining bowel mucosa shows no significant abnormality.  
B.  Sections of omentum show extensive infiltration by neuroendocrine tumour.  
C.  Sections show a deposit of neuroendocrine tumour.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Small bowel, omentum and peritoneal nodule.
-  Neuroendocrine tumour G2 (NET G2).
-  Extension beyond muscularis propria (pT3).
-  Resection marginsclear of tumour.
-  Tumour deposits within mesentery (pN1c).
-  Lymphovascular invasion present.
-  Omentum and peritoneum involved by tumour.
