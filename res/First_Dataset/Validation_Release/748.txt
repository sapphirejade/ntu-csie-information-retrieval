SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.3.64):


CLINICAL:
Right thalamic lesion - ?met ?glioma.  Poor nutrition and fluid intake post op, family concerned and requested review.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right thalamic lesion" consists of six tan/pink fragments from 1 to 6mm in maximum dimension.  Two smears and3/4 of the remainder in one block for frozen section.  Note by TC/FI on the 15.1.2014 at 11:12am.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section; 2 - the remainder, AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour high grade glioma.
Result to Dr Kirsten LACOURSE by Dr VA/GA/GW at 11:27 am on the 14.1.2014
B.  Specimenlabelled "Right thalamic lesion" consists of six fragments ranging from 2 to 7mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.  (TO: TQ; BY/rt 18.3.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Wehmeyer):
A, B.  Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  The tumour is cellular and consists of sheets of cells with large, hyperchromatic atypical nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with poorly defined cell borders.  Mitoses are identified and there is palisaded tumour necrosis.  There is also some microvascular proliferation.  No normal brain tissue is seen.  The appearances are of glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).  
Immunohistochemical stains:
GFAP:  Positive. 
p53:  Positive.  Around 50% of tumour cells show positive nuclear staining.  
IDH1:  Negative.  
Ki-67:  To follow.
Molecular tests:
Tissue will be forwarded to Dr Y Contreres, CENTRAL GIPPSLAND HEALTH SERVICE (MAFFRA) Centre, for MGMT testing and a supplementary report issued.  

Block for potential treatment trial (if required):  
Viable tumour with less procedural artefact is best seen in block A2.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Right thalamic tumour:  Glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.3.64):
Ki-67:  High proliferation index.  Around 50% of tumour cells show positive staining.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (29.4.64):
Tissue was sent to the MATER ADULT HOSPITAL Centre for MGMT testing.
DNA was extracted from paraffin tissue.  The DNA was bisulphite modified and subjected to pyrosequencing to amplify a region of the MGMT promoter in order to detect methylation.
The MGMT promoter was Unmethylated.

Reported byDr Y Bostwick.
Please note that this test was done in a research laboratory which is not NATA accredited.
