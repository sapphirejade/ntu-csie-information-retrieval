CLINICAL:
69yo woman with grade 3 endometrial cancer.  Endometrial polyp.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix tubes and ovaries" consists of previously opened uterus with attached cervix and fallopian tubes and ovaries.  The specimen weighs 100g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 40 x 40mm and has a shiny and smooth serosal surface.  The cervix measures 20 x 20mm and the cervical mucosa is unremarkable.  On sectioning and in the fundus of the endometrial cavity there is an exophytic and fungating lesion extending anteriorly and posteriorly measuring 30 x 20 x 20mm.  The endometrium has a maximum thickness of 20mm and the myometrium has a maximum thickness of 20mm.  The myometrium contains several fibroids ranging from 5 to 15mm in maximum diameter.  The right fallopian tube measuring 70 x 5 x 5mm, thefimbria is present. The right ovary measures 30 x 15 x 10mm macroscopically it is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 60 x 5 x 5mm and macroscopically appears unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 30 x 15 x 5mm macroscopically it is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 6 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix (blocks 3 & 4- composite of one section including endometrium and myometrium); 7 - composite of one representative section of anterior endomyometrium with tumour; 9 - one representative section of anterior endomyometrium with tumour; 10 to 13 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 14 & 15 - two representative sections of posterior and the myometrium; 16 - tissue from tumour for tissue bank; 17 - right parametrial tissue; 18 - left parametrial tissue; 19 - two LS right fimbria; 20 - right fallopian tube and one representative section from the right ovary; 21 - two LSleft fimbria; 22 - one representative section of the left ovary and one TS left fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Endometrial polyp" consists of a large polyp measuring 40 x 30 x 15mm.  The external surface is soft and tan and the cut surface is pink and fleshy with areas of ?necrosis.  AE 5 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50 x 30 x 30mm with two lymph nodes measuring 15 x 35mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - 5 biggest lymphnode AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of apiece of fatty tissue 70 x 50 x 20mm.  Five lymph nodes are identified measuring from 5 to 25mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one representative section from the biggest lymph node; 2 & 3 - two lymph nodes each;4-5 rest of the biggest lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a pieceof fatty tissue 60 x 50 x 20mm with three lymph nodes measuring from 15mm up to 30mm. 
Blocks: 1 - one representative section from the biggest lymph node; 2 & 3 - one bisected lymph node each; 4-5 remainder of the biggest lymph node AE.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of tissue 70 x 50 x 20mm with one large lymph node measuring 60 x 20 x 10mm.
Blocks: AE 5 blocks .  (KH/ta  20/9/62) 
  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr M Solan):
A.  Sections show endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (the hysterectomy specimen appears to be grade 2 however when taking the previous curette and specimen B into account the overall grade is favouredas 3).   No definite myometrial invasion is seen.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.  The myometrium shows several leiomyomas.

B.  Sections show a large polypoid fragment of grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.  Eleven nodes are negative.
