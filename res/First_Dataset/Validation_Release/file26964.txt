The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 34 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 1mm in thickness with a maximal myometrial thickness of 21mm.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 60 x 5mm and the left ovary measures 45 x 28 x 17mm.  Transverse sectioning of the ovary (eight slices) shows multiple cystic spaces, 4 to 13mm in extent.  The cystic spaces have smooth tan walls with no solid or papillary excrescences.
