***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: HER-2 CISH (26.3.2063) Dr I Credle

CLINICAL:
(L) breast Ca and extensive malignant calcification.  Tumour at 4-5.00.  Axillary sentinel node.
[Additional history from Prof Hugo's rooms: Imagine revealed two lesions presumed a dumbbell shaped tumour at 5 and 6 o'clock 4cm from the nipple].
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node (L) breast" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 22mm.  One lymph node 15mm is identified.  Serially sectioned and imprint cytology performed.
Blocks:  1 - lymph node AE; 2 - ?small lymph node identified within fat.
B.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 2 left breast" consists of a piece of tan and fatty tissue 28 x 18 x 12mm.  One 20mm lymph node is identified.  Serially sectioned, AE one block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 3 left breast" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 18 x 13 x 10mm.  One 15mm lymph node is identified.  Serially sectioned, AE one block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Axillary node left breast" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 18 x 15 x 12mm.  One 16mm lymph node is identified.  BAE one block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left breast, stitch at axilla" consists of a mastectomy, 230mm (medial-lateral) x 210mm (inferior-superior) x 45mm(superficial-deep).  There is an overlying ellipse of skin 205mm (medial-lateral) x 85mm (inferior-superior) with an overlying nipple/areola complex, 35 x 35mm which appears unremarkable.  There is a suture attached at one pole marking axilla.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned into thirteen slices from slice 1 lateral to slice 13 medial.  In the 5 to 6 o'clock position (slices 7 to 9), approximately 60mm from the nipple, a firm cream-tan tumour is identified measuring 32mm (medial-lateral) x 18mm (inferior-superior) x 18mm (superficial-deep).  The distance from margins is as follows:  inferosuperficial margin 4mm, well clear of the medial, lateral and superosuperficial margins, and 35mm from the deep margin.  Otherwise the cut surface reveals large areas of fibrous tissue with numerous large cysts throughout.  Two ?lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - tumour in slice 7 from skin to superficial to deep margins; 4 & 5 - tumour in slice 8 including superficial margin; 6 - tumour in slice 9 including superficial margin; 7 - tissue lateral to tumour; 8 - tissue superior to tumour; 9 - tissue medial to tumour; 10 & 11 - representative outer upper quadrant; 12 & 13 - representative outer lower quadrant; 14 - further representative outer upper quadrant; 15 & 16 - representative inner upper quadrant;17 & 18 - representative inner lower quadrant; 19 - nipple and tissue deep to nipple; 20 - lymph nodes; 21 - reserve block.  Please refer to attached diagram.   (RR/cc  12/3/63) 
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
Negative for tumour.
Phone result via Anaesthetist to Dr I Clarence by Dr I Lounsbery at 11.39am on 9/1/13.
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Malawy - 13.3.2063)
A.  One of two sentinel lymph nodes shows two isolated tumour cells (<0.2mm) detected by immunohistochemistry. 
B.Sections of the sentinel lymph node (no. 2) show no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
C.  Sections of the sentinel lymph node (no. 3) show no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
D.  Sections of the axillary lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
E.  Sections of the left breast tumour show two discrete foci of invasive ductal carcinoma associated with widespread intermediate to high grade DCIS. A synoptic report for invasive carcinoma follows:
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA
Invasive carcinoma - 1 (block E2)
Site:  Left breast, mastectomy
Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma.
The carcinoma consists of infiltrative sheets with central necrosis, variably thick trabeculae and infiltrative tubules. 
Invasive tumour size: 32mm (macroscopic).
Grade: 3 (Modified Bloom & Richardson)       
Tubules: 2 Nuclei: 3 Mitoses: 3 Mitotic rate: Up to 38 mitoses/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified.
	   
Invasive carcinoma - 2 (block E2)
Site:  Left breast, mastectomy
Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma
The carcinoma consists of infiltrative tubules adjacent to a focus of DCIS. The tumour is 11mm from tumour one and has a different morphology to tumour 1. 
Invasive tumour size: 5.5mm (macroscopic).
Grade: 1 (Modified Bloom & Richardson)       
Tubules: 1 Nuclei: 2 Mitoses: 1 Mitotic rate: Up to 1 mitoses/10hpf 
(Tumour too small for accurate mitotic count).
Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. 
 
DCIS component:  
DCIS: Present 
Maximum extent of DCIS: DCIS is present in tissue around the tumour over an approximate maximum extent of 40mm.
Nuclear grade: Intermediate to high grade.

Necrosis: Present.
Calcification: Present.
Degree of DCIS in tumour: Mild.
DCIS in adjacent tissue: There is extensive DCIS in the surrounding breast tissue.
