CLINICAL:
Chondrosarcoma left anterolateral chest wall, ribs 8, 9, 10; - short suture superior (rib 8), long lateral, medium medial, double on diaphragm insertion.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left chest wall; short superior, medium medial, double stitch diaphragm" consists of three ribs with a large tumour mass and overlying subcutaneous tissue and skin.  There are four sutures for orientation as above.  The specimen measures 160mm (medial-lateral) x 110mm (superficial-deep) x 100mm (superior-inferior).  The overlying ellipse of skin measures 180 x 80mm with a thickness of 50mm.  Rib 8 measures 120mm in length and 12mm in thickness.  Rib 9 measures 130mm in length and 10mm in thickness.  Rib 10 measures approximately 130mm in length and 10mm in thickness.  The superior margin of the specimen is inkedblue, the inferior margin black and the diaphragm insertion green. 
At the posterior surface of the ribs there is a large, apparently partly cystic tumour measuring 90mm (medial-lateral) x 70mm (superior-inferior) x 70mm (superficial-deep).  The posterior margin of the tumour is partly covered by fascia and adipose tissue.  Macroscopically the tumour is 10mm from the superior margin, 40mm from the medial margin, 20mm from the lateral margin and <5mm from the inferior margin .  On sectioning, the tumour has a variegated appearance with multiple cysts filled with gelatinous haemorrhagic material, areas of necrosis and areas of haemorrhage.  There are solid glistening areas of tumour identified centrally in the mass.  The middle of the three ribs (rib 9) extends into the mass and is partly destroyed.  Ribs 8 and 10 abut the mass but do not appear to be involved by tumour macroscopically.  Representative sections are taken.
Blocks:  1 - shave of ribs medial margin; 2 - shave of lateral margin rib 8; 3 - shave of lateral margin rib 9; 4 - shave of lateral margin rib 10; 5 to 11 - one full face of tumour with rib 9 and 10; 12 - rib 8 transverse section attached to tumour; 13 & 14 - two representative sections of superior margin with tumour; 15 - representative section of tumour with superficial-inferior margin; 16 - representative section of tumour with inferior margin; 17 - tumour with inferior margin; 18 - tumour with diaphragmatic margin; 19 - tumour with diaphragmatic margin; 20 - tumour with posterosuperior margin; 21 - posteroinferior margin; 22 - one longitudinal section of intercostal muscle with tumour between ribs 9 and10 (blocks 6 & 7 - reserved blocks).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Nedman):
Sections show a moderately differentiated (grade 2) chondrosarcoma, apparently arising fromthe 9th rib.  The tumour consists of cartilage with a moderate increase in cellularity and the chondrocyte nuclei show moderate pleomorphism, atypia and hyperchromasia.  Binucleate chondrocytes are noted.  Much of the central tumour is necrotic and this is what gave the macroscopic impression of central cystic change.  The tumour invades into skeletal muscleand other soft tissues of the chest wall with a lobulated, pushing margin.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  Mitoses are infrequent.  In the sections the 9th rib is completely replaced by tumour and the 8th rib is also partly involved by tumour (block 10).  Some pleura is noted on the deep surface of the mass and this shows non-specificreactive mesothelial proliferation.  No pleural invasion by tumour is seen.  
All soft tissue and bone excision margins appear to be free of tumour.  Tumour is 2mm from the nearest superior soft tissue excision margin, 1.3mm from the nearest inferior soft tissue margin and 4mm from the nearest diaphragmatic soft tissue margin.  Medial, lateral and anterior soft tissue margins are well clear.  Tumour is 2mm from the nearest diaphragmatic pleural surface and 4mm from the nearest posterior pleural surface.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Left chest wall:  Grade 2 chondrosarcoma.
