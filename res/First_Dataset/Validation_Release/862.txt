CLINICAL:
63 year - radical neck dissection for #ca floor of mouth #ca of oesophagus.  Frozen section ?SCC.   Lymph node left neck dissection.  Floor of mouth lesion abutting gingiva bx as SCC.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Lymph node left neck dissection", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 60 x 20 x 10mm containing multiple (four) lymph nodes from 5-11mm. Each node is embedded for FS in 4 blocks. Blocks 1-4 - FS.
FROZEN SECTION:  Four negative lymph nodes.
Result to anaesthetist by Dr S Chavarin at 11:50am on 23.10.12. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Tumour floor of mouth", (orientated by surgical registrar), consists of an irregular piece of tissue with a fragment of gingival mucosa.  The gingival mucosa is anterior. The specimen measures 60mm from superior to inferior, 20mm from anterior to posterior and 40mm from medial to lateral. On the anterosuperior aspect of the specimen there is ? exposed white tumour. The anterior inferior aspect of the specimen is smooth and shiny. The posterior aspect is ragged.  The specimen is inked blue anterior margin, black posterior margin, green false margin.  The specimen is serially sectioned from right to left into seven slices. Slice 1 - right resection margin; 7 - left margin.  Specimen is embedded but no AE according to the diagram attached. Block 1- 1 representative section from theright margin; 2 & 3- slice 2; 4-6 - slice 3; 7-9 - slice 4; 10-12 - slice 5; 13-15 - slice 6; 16 & 17 - slice 7 (block 10 reserved block). 
C.  Specimen labelled "Level 1 right neck", consists of a piece of fatty tissue with salivary glandattached 75 x 30 x 20mm.  The specimen contains six lymph nodes ranging from 2 to 10mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one bisected lymph node each; 4 - three lymph nodes; 5 - representative sections from the salivary gland.  (TO: PG: PG/ec 27/122062) 
D.  Specimen labelled "Level I left neck" consistsof a piece of fatty tissue, 30 x 20 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes, 3 and 7mm in maximum diameter.
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2- one lymph node; 3 & 4 - rest of tissue.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right neck" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 80 x 15 x 10mm containing five lymph nodes ranging from 7 to 20mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - one bisected lymph node each; 5 - one lymph node.
(TO: PG; PG/mm 26.12.62) 
F.  Specimen labelled "Anterior gingiva mandibular suture 12 o'clock" consists of a piece of gingiva 55 x 10 x 2mm.  There is a suture for orientation, 12 o'clock. The mucosal surface is shiny and smooth with some haemorrhagic areas.  12 o'clock margin inked blue, 6 o'clock margin inked black.  Block 1 - 3 o'clock margin 2LS; 2 - 
9 o'clock margin, 2LS; 3-6 of tissue embedded from 9-3 o'clock.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left gingiva", consists of an unoriented and irregular piece of gingival mucosal 25 x 20 x 2mm.  AE 4 blocks.  (TO: PG: PG/ec 27.12.62)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr S Allegretti) 
A. Sections show 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show a poorly differentiated, basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.  The lesion is composed of nests of basaloid tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei and minimal cytoplasm.  Numerous mitoses and areas of necrosis are present.
In the inferior aspect of the specimen, there is direct and intraduct invasion of the submandibular gland.  A small amount of tongue skeletal muscle in the posterior aspect of the specimen shows no evidence of malignancy.
Lymphovascular invasion is focally present.
A single node next to the submandibular gland shows no evidence of malignancy.
SUMMARY
Site: Floor of mouth
Tumour type: Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma
Grade: Poorly differentiated (G3)
Size: 32mm (right to left) x 17mm (anterior to posterior)
Tumour thickness: 50mm (superior to inferior)
Extent of invasion: 
	Tumour invades underlying submandibular gland
	Tongue skeletal muscle not involved

Lymphovascular invasion:Present, x 1 focus (B3)
Perineural invasion: Not seen
p16 expression: negative (no staining)
Mucosal margins:
  Posterior: positive (B10)
  Anterior: < 0.1mm (B8)
  Left lateral: 1.3mm (B16)
  Right lateral: 8mm
Soft tissue margins:
  Left inferior: positive (B17)
  Anterior: < 0.1mm (B8)
  Posterior: 0.2mm (B8)
  Inferior: 1mm (B15)
  Right lateral: 8mm
C. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy. The submandibular gland shows several foci of intraduct and invasive carcinoma up to 5mm in size, clear ofmargins.
D. Sections show 7 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.  A small fragment of salivary gland tissue is also present.
E. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
F. Sections show squamous mucosa, skeletal muscle and bone with no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show squamous mucosa with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Frozen section lymph nodes left neck dissection: 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
B. Tumour floor of mouth:
- Poorly differentiated basilar squamous cell carcinoma (see above for margins)
- Invasion into submandibular glandand lymphovascular invasion present
- p16 negative
- 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
C. Right neck dissectionlevel 1:
- 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
- Intraduct and invasive carcinoma in submandibular gland
D. Left neck dissection level 1: 7 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Right neck dissection: 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
F. Anterior gingiva mandible: no evidence of malignancy
G. Left gingiva: no evidence of malignancy
