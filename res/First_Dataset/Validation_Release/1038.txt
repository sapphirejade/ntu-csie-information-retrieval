CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Omental biopsy.  Pelvic washings.  Right external iliac lymph nodes.  Uterus, right fallopian tube, right ovary, and cervix.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix right fallopian tube" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right ovary and fallopian tube together weighing 149g.  The uterus measures 85 x 60 x 55mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures  30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The anterior cervical wall is inked black and posterior blue.  On sectioning a large fungating pale tan tumour involves the entire endometrium.  The tumour possibly extends to the posterior endocervical canal.  The tumour measures 70mm (superior to inferior) and 35mm (side to side).  It is 17mm from endocervical os.  On sectioning the tumour appears to invade the myometrium to a depth of 8mm where total myometrial thickness is 20mm (block A4).  An 18mm sub-serosal fibroid is present in the lateral uterine wall.  The right fallopian tube including fimbria measures 55 x 10mm and there are some small paratubal cysts.  The right ovary measures 24 x 12 x 12mm and has no unusual features on sectioning.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 10 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix (block 8 & 9 are paired blocks); 11 - fibroid; 12 - right parametrial; 13 - left parametrial; 14 - ovary; 15 - fallopian tube; 16 -reserve block for tissue bank.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes with attached fatty tissue measuring 25 and 30mm in greatest dimension.  AE.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one node; 3 & 4 - one node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of two pieces of omentum 95 x 65 x 10mm and 85 x 60 x 20mm.  No abnormality is identified macroscopically.  Three representative blocks.      (KJ/ta 28/9/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr A Passwater):
A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Much of it has a well differentiated villoglandular architecture but there is a significant solid component (block A8).  The maximum depth of myometrial invasion is measured at 11mm where total myometrial thickness is 25mm.  There are foci of lymphovascular invasion (block A8).  Tumourinvolves the endometrium of the lower segment but no involvement of the cervix is seen.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  A leiomyoma is confirmed in the myometrium.  Sections of the right ovary and tube are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
C.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, right ovary and fallopian tube:  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, grade 2.  Myometrial invasion <50%.  Stage 1A.
B.  Rightexternal iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
C.  Biopsy omentum:  No tumour.
