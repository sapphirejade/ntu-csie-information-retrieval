CLINICAL:
Left pretibial sarcoma.  Hypertension, asthma, ca prostate, gord.  Excision of left pre tibial sarcomawith underlying tibia, suture 12 o'clock.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left tibial sarcoma stitch 12 o'clock" consists of an orientated ellipse of skin with a suture (12  o'clock) to muscle including segment of tibia measuring in total 120mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 100mm (3 to 9 o'clock) x 60mm (superficial to deep).  The skin has multiple tan nodules from 2 to 4mm.  The segment of bone is 55mm in length x 30mm in diameter (2 to 7 o'clock).  The specimen is inked as follows:  3 o'clock - blue, 9 o'clock - black.  On sectioning there is a lobulated soft cream tumour within the subcutaneous tissue which appears to abut the tibial bone and superficial dermis of the skin.  The tumour has haemorrhagic and necrotic areas and measures 50 x 45mm in diameter and is 19mm inlength.  The tumour is 15mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 8mm from the 3 o'clock margin, appears to abut the deep margin and is 6mm from the 6 o'clock margin.  The tumour is 7mm from the 12 o'clock margin.  The false margin between the tibial bone and soft tissue is inked red.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - LS 6 o'clock margin; 3 & 4 - (paired blocks) TS through tumour below tibia; 5 - tumour abutting deep margin; 6 - tumour and 3 o'clock; 7 - tumour and 9 o'clock; 8 & 9 - tumour and 12 o'clock one LS; 10 to 12 - tumour.  (KO/ta 2/12/63) 
Blocks 13 to 15: tumour with bone
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Sheerin): 
Sections show a 50 mm pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma).  Lesion is composed of sheets of spindled and polygonal shaped tumour cells with markedly pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Numerous mitoses (52 per 10 hpf), includingmutipolar forms are seen.  Scattered tumour cells with giant pleomorphic nuclei are present.
The lesion is based in the subcutaneous fat and focally involves the dermis (7). The lesion abuts but does not invade the periosteum or fibrous fascia. There is no evidence of invasion into bone or muscle.
Immunoperoxidase stains:
Positive: vimentin
Negative: panCK, AE1/3, CAM5.2, EMA, MelanA, HMB45, S100, SOX10, CD31, factor VIII, desmin, myogenin, SMA
Margins:
 Deep: 0.3mm (separated by periosteum, 5)
 9 o'clock: 2mm (4)
 3 o'clock: 4mm (6)
 12 and 6 o'clock: 8mm (8, 1)
FNCLCC grading:
 Tumour differentiation: 3 (undifferentiated sarcoma)
 Mitosis: 3 (> 20/10 hpf)
 Necrosis: 1 (< 50% necrosis)
 
 Grade: 3 (7 out of 8)
DIAGNOSIS:
Left pretibial lesion: 50mm pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma)

Karyotype:
No analysable or countable cells seen.
Comment:
Regrettably the only cells seen were of too poor quality to be analysed or counted.
Please advise the Laboratory (8382 9154) should interphase FISH be of assistance in this case.
