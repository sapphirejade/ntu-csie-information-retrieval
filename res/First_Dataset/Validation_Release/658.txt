CLINICAL:
Known metastatic islet cell tumour of the pancreas.  Reflux.  Hiatus hernia.  Diverticulitis.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube, ovary" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 60mm in length x 7 x 5mm in maximum dimension, with attached ovary 20 x 10 x 5mm.  There are three translucent cystic masses adherent to the serosalsurface of the tube measuring 2 to 4mm in maximum diameter.  The ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative in 3 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - fallopian tube; 2 & 3 - ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary and tube" consists of an ovarian mass measuring 45 x 30 x 28mm and four fragments of fallopian tube measuring from 20 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and the cut surface shows a solid variegated tan to yellow appearance.  Representative in 5 blocks.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - ovarian mass; 5 - fallopian tube.  (TO: WE; NF/rt 23.3.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Lubow):
A.  Sections show ovary and fallopian tube.  Within the ovary there are small foci of involvement by tumour.  This consists of nests of cells with small regular nuclei and eosinophilic, often granular cytoplasm.  The features are consistent with foci of involvement by metastatic pancreatic islet cell tumour.  Sections of the fallopian tube also show foci of metastatic islet cell tumour at the fimbrial end.  There is focal lymphovascular invasion.  The ovary and tube are otherwise unremarkable.
B.  Sections of the ovary show extensive involvement by metastatic pancreatic islet cell tumour.  There is an associated densefibrotic stroma.  Tumour also extends into para ovarian soft tissue.  The sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right tube and ovary:  Foci of metastatic islet cell tumour in ovary and at fimbrial end of tube.
B.  Left ovary and tube:  Metastatic islet cell tumour in ovary and para ovarian soft tissue.
