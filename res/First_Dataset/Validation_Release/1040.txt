CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  Laparoscopic hysterectomy, BSO, PLND.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries + cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 75g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 50 x 30mm.  It has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a tan friable tumour within the endometrial cavity measuring approximately 48 x 45 x 12mm (thickness).  The tumour appears to be clear of the serosal surface by at least 10mm.  The myometrium is 17mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 75mm in length and up to 9mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 16 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length.  The fimbriated end is distended up to 11mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 30 x 14 x 10mm and has an unremarkablecut surface. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 - tumour and closest serosal surface; 8 - section of tumour, reserve block for tumour bank; 9 - representative right fallopian tube; 10 - representative right ovary; 11 - representative left fallopian tube including one section from the distended fimbriated end; 12 - representative left ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 35 x 25 x 18mm.  There are up to five lymph nodes.  The largest is 27mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - up to four lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 48 x22 x 15mm.  There are two lymph nodes 10 and 14mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one trisected lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 80 x 27 x 15mm.  There are two lymph nodes22 and 16mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 58 x 15 x 13mm.  There are up to three lymph nodes ranging from 7 to 25mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one likely lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 20 x 11 x 6mm.  There are up to two lymph nodes 8 and 12mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 - two likely lymph nodes.   (HM/cc 16/10/62)
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Flatt): 
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 5mm through a wall 17mm thick.  A moderate amount of lymphvascular invasion is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The left tube shows a hydrosalpinx with chronic salpingitis.  The right tube and both ovaries are unremarkable.
B.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Twolymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, 5mm through a wall 17mm thick.  Lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.  Fourteen (14) lymph nodes are negative.
