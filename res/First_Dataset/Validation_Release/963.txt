B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 183g when fresh.  The uterus measures 95 x 70 x 50mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  There is a defect in the anterior uterine serosafrom where the frozen section was taken.  There are two further small cream areas on the posterior serosa measuring 3 and 4mm.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm.  There is a bulging tumour mass predominately in the anterior cervix measuring 15 x 15mm.  The cut   surface reveals a cream firm tumour in the endocervix measuring 25 x 20 and appearing to invade to a maximum depth of 15mm over a total thickness of 20mm anteriorly.  Anteriorly there is a vaginal cuff measuring 60 x 25mm.  The tumour appears well clear of the vaginal cuff margin, by approximately 25mm.  Posteriorly there is a cream area in the endocervix measuring 26 x 15mm, ?tumour; this appears to invade to a maximum depth of 6mm over atotal wall thickness of 18mm.  There is a vaginal cuff posteriorly measuring 45 x 20mm.  The ?tumour appears well clear of the vaginal cuff, by approximately 28mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness over a totalwall thickness of 26mm.  The cream areas seen posteriorly on the serosal surface appear to be small fibroids.  The myometrium is unremarkable apart from several small fibroids up to 5mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 10mm.  The right ovary measures 35 x 20 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 16 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 27 - remainder of anterior vaginal cuff and cervix AE from right to left (paired blocks - 8 and 9, 10 and 11, 12 and 13, 14 and 15, 16 and 17, 18 and 19, 20 and 21, 22 and 23, 24 and 25); 28 to 32 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 33 to 47 - remainder of posterior cervix AE from left to right (paired blocks 36 and 37, 38 and 39, 40 and 41, 42 and 43, 44 and 45); 33 to 48 - with the posterior cervix AE; 49 - posterior fibroids; 50 - right tube; 51 - right ovary; 52 - left tube; 53 - left ovary.  Please refer to attached diagram. 
C.  Specimen labelled "R obturator lymph node", consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 35 and 80mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, from 3 to 25mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of two piece of ragged fatty tissue 30 and 45mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 4 to 15mm. 
Blocks: 1 and 2 - lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
E.  Specimen labelled"Right common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm.  One ?lymph node 13mm is identified.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - remainder of tissue AE.
F.  Specimen labelled"Left common iliac lymph node", consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue from 15 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 4 to 18mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of multiple fragments of ragged fatty tissue from 10 to 50mm in maximum dimension.  There are multiple lymph nodes identified from 8 to 15mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
H.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of multiple fragments of tan and fatty tissue from 10 to 40mm in maximum dimension.  Two lymph nodes are identified 18 and 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - one lymph node bisected.
I.  Specimen labelled "Parametrium", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 16mm.  AE 1 block. 
J.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of fatty omental tissue 80 x 70 x 15mm.  No suspicious areas are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.(TO: MZ;OZ/vo 13.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Steel):
A.  Sections show a leiomyoma.There is no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.  Many of the tumour cells have vacuolated cytoplasm; mucin stains (alcian blue and PASD) highlight many macrophages associated with the tumour but no convincing mucin is identified in the cytoplasm of tumour cells.  The tumour involves the whole anterior lip and also the left side of the posterior lip.  It measures 24mm in length (slides 14 and 15) andaround 25mm wide, and invades the cervical stroma to a depth of 12mm out of a total wall thickness of 21mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion.  No perineural invasion is seen.  The posterior lip also shows changes of CIN 3.  The vaginal cuff margin is well clear of invasive carcinoma and CIN 3.  The endocervical columnar epithelium is unremarkable. 
There is also mesonephric hyperplasia in the cervix.
The endometrium shows features of exogenous hormone effect.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable. 
C.  Sections show no malignancy in six lymph nodes (0/6).
D.  Sections show no malignancy in nine lymph nodes (0/9).
E.  Sections show no malignancy in one lymph node (0/1).
F.  Sections show no malignancy in four lymph nodes (0/4).
 
G.  Sections show no malignancy in five lymph nodes (0/5).
H.  Sections show no malignancy in two lymph nodes (0/2).
I.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  There is no malignancy.
J.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  There is nomalignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterine serosa:  Leiomyoma.
B.  Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries:  Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix, stage 1B1. 
C.  R obturator lymph node:  No malignancy in six nodes (0/6).
D.  Left obturator lymph node:  No malignancy in nine nodes (0/9).
E.  Right common iliac lymph node:  No malignancy in one node (0/1).
F.  Left common iliac lymph node:  No malignancy in four nodes (0/4).
G.  Right external iliac lymph node:  No malignancy in five nodes (0/5).
H.  Left external iliac lymph node:  No malignancy in two nodes (0/2).
I.   Parametrium:  No malignancy.
J.Omental biopsy:  No malignancy.
