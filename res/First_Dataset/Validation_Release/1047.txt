SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.10.62):


CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and segments of right and left fallopian tubes attached weighing in total 117g.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 50mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  Theectocervix measures 40 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrial cavity is totally replaced by an exophytic and fungating friable tumour.  The tumour extends into the lower uterine segment.  On sectioning the endometrium has a maximum thickness of 10mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 15mm.  An intramural fibroid measuring 15mm in maximum diameter is also noted.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - one full longitudinal section anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - two representative sections ofthe anterior end of myometrium with tumour; 7 to 10 - one full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - two representative sections of the posteriorendomyometrium with tumour; 13 - one representative section of the fibroid; 14 - one representative section of the right tube; 15 - one representative section of the left tube; 16 - right parametrial tissue; 17 - left parametrial tissue; 18 - tissue for tissue banking.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right caecal biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 10 x 10 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 25 x 5 x 5mm.  AE 1 block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fat tissue 40 x 30 x 25mm with two lymph nodes measuring 20 and 15mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fat tissue 50 x 50 x 10mm with two lymph nodes measuring 20 and 15mm in maximum diameter.  Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40 x 40 x 20mm with three lymph nodes measuring 20,10, and 10mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one bisected lymph node each.   
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x 20 x 20mm with a lymph node 10mm in maximum diameter. 
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 200 x 120 x 20mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  Three representative sections in 3 blocks.(JG/ta 8/7/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Y Cirioni):
A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show that overall this is a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, with squamous differentiation.  No malignant stromal (sarcomatous) component is identified.  There is patchy tumour necrosis.  A minority of the tumour (blocks A9, A12) has a solid, squamoid appearance and this component shows multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 13mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 24mm.  Tumour is confirmed to extend into the lower uterine segment but there is no cervical involvement.  A leiomyoma is confirmed in the myometrium.  
A section of the right fallopian tube stump shows an inflammatory reaction on the serosal surface but no tumour is seen.  The left fallopian tube stump is unremarkable.  Sections of theright and left parametrial tissues show some tissue necrosis and organising fibroblastic tissue, consistent with a reaction to recent surgery.  No tumour is seen in the parametria.
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr Y Lin.  
B.  Sections show necrotic tissue with some adjacent organising fibroblastic tissue.  No tumouris seen.
C.  Sections show fibrofat with some associated fibroblastic tissue.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
F.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
G.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
H.  Sectionsshow unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium with greater than 50% myometrial invasion.  Stage 1B.
B.  Right caecal biopsy:  No tumour.
C.  Right bladder peritoneum:  No tumour.
D.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
E.Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
F.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
G.  Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
H.  Omental biopsy:  No tumour.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.10.62):
1.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
MSH2 - Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6 - Preserved nuclear staining.
MLH1 - Loss of nuclear staining.
PMS2 - Loss of nuclear staining.
Comment:  Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI) and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
