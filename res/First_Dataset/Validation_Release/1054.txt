CLINICAL:
Right hemicolectomy for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a specimen of terminal ileum stump (55mm long), caecumand ascending colon (105mm long) and pericolonic fatty tissue (115 x 70 x 18mm).  There is an indurated tumour in the ascending colon immediately adjacent to the ileocaecal valve, 68 x 50 x 14mm.  The tumour has raised edges, an ulcerated centre and occupies up to 70% of the large bowel circumference.  It is 55mm from proximal and 64mm from the distal resection margin.  The tumour appears to have infiltrated through the muscularis propria.  The vermiform appendix is not identified.  There are several lymph nodes.  
Blocks: 1 - shave proximal margin; 2 - shave distal margin; 3 & 4 - comprise one LS of tumour adjacent to the ileo caecal valve; 5 & 6 - paired transversesections of the tumour (the notches demonstrate the relationship of two sections); 7 - TS, tumour; 8 - TS tumour, reserve block fortumour bank; 9 - one lymph node in multiple slices; 10 - interface of tumour and adjacent colonic mucosa; 11 - bisected apical lymph node; 12 - one bisected lymph node; 13 - one bisected lymph node; 14 - lymph nodes; 15 - one bisected lymph node; 16 - one bisected lymph node; 17 & 18 - sections of pericolonic fat looking for lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr C Alexzander):

Site of tumour: Ascending colon with direct involvement of ileocaecal valve	
Maximum tumour diameter:    68mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:    55mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: 14	
Number of lymph nodes involved: 0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumourstatus
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
