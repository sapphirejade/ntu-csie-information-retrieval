HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Ovarian mass. Ca 19.9 = 1600. Right ovary + tube for frozen section.  Five specimens received in total.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT OVARY + TUBE&amp;quot;. Consists of ovary with attached fallopian tube.  It weighs 1.7kg, and measures 200x180x70mm with attached fallopian tube 100mm long and 8mm diameter. Outside surface shows a defect 40x40mm.  Confirmed with Dr. Wilmoth, the defect is a pre-op finding (tumour rupture prior to surgery).  Two sections taken for frozen section.

F/S : &amp;quot;Mucinous tumour, favour borderline.  Needs to be sampled further for malignancy&amp;quot;.  Reported to Dr. Ducayne on 20.4.17 at 4.20pm.

The mass is partially solid, partially cystic. The cystic component is filled with mucinous material.  The solid component makes up approximately 90% of the lesion. The ovarian surface is uniformly smooth. Specimen has been opened. The intact serosal surface is inked green.  On sectioning the cut surface is solid areas with pale cream coloured and multiple cystic areas within the solid base.  Representative sections were taken.

(1&amp;amp;2 FS; 3 fimbrial end of fallopian tubes and two TS; 4-8 area with the serosal disruption; 9-13 sections of tumour including serosal surface; 14-18 sections of solid areas of tumour; 19&amp;amp;20 further sections).  RS (M-20)

B.  &amp;quot;UTERUS + LEFT OVARY + TUBE&amp;quot;.  Consists of uterus with attached cervix and left ovary/cystic mass and fallopian tube.  Anteriorly is a third piece of fibrofatty tissue.  The serosa is roughened and disrupted over many areas (serosal adhesions). The piece of fibrofatty tissue attached anteriorly shows some mucinous material on the surface. Also noted at the right parametrial tissue is mucinous material.  Anterior inked blue, posterior black. The uterus with attached cervix together weighs 124g and it measures 85mm superior to inferior, 40mm intercornual distance, ectocervix is 35x35mm with a slit-like os 25mm. Anterior endomyometrium is 15mm, posterior endomyometrium is 15mm.  The endometrial cavity appears to be fibrosed partially.  On sectioning through the myometrium there is one nodule measuring 16mm with a pale white whorled cut surface consistent with a fibroid.  It is located intramurally. The attached piece of fibrofatty tissue anterior is up to 100mm wide.

(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 anterior lower uterine segment; 4 posterior lower uterine segment; 5 anterior and posterior endomyometrium, 6 fundal aspect with serosal roughening; 7 fibroid; 8 piece of fibrofatty tissue attached to the anterior aspect of the uterus; 9 left parametrial tissue showing mucinous material)

The left ovary (cystic mass) plus fallopian tube together weigh 35g.  Ovarian serosa is roughened.  It is inked blue.  It measures 40x35x30mm.  The fallopian tube shows previous evidence of tubal ligation. The serosa is partially roughened.  It measures 30mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm.

(10 fimbrial end of left fallopian tube plus one TS)

On sectioning through the left adnexal mass, the cut surface reveals a cyst filled with clear serous fluid. The inner wall lining is smooth.  No papillary excrescences or solid areas are identified.  There is residual ovarian tissue noted.

(11-13 sections of cyst wall; 14&amp;amp;15 residual ovarian tissue). RS (M-15)

C.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum.  It measures 460x280x30mm.  No firm or solid areas are palpated or seen on sectioning.  There is a possible area of fat necrosis.

(1&amp;amp;2 site of fat necrosis; 3&amp;amp;4 further sections of omentum). RS (M-4)

D.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of nodal tissue.  It measures 10x6x3mm.  Bisected.  AE (2-1)

E.  &amp;quot;JEJUNAL SEROSAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Consists of one piece of tissue 3mm maximum dimension.  AE (1-1/MC/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr F Grassman)
A. The ovarian tumour has been extensively sampled and sections show features in keeping with a borderline mucinous tumour. The tumour is multiloculated and lined by columnar mucin secreting epithelium with scattered goblet cells and mild to moderate atypia. There are foci of proliferation characterised by mild epithelial budding and tufting. There are no areas of high-grade nuclear cytology, and no areas of cribriform architecture. There are no features to suggest invasive malignancy. There are areas of necrosis and dystrophic calcification. Sections of the fallopian tube include small paratubal  serous cysts.

There is also extensive organising mucin on the surface of the ovary and the fallopian tube. No mucinous epithelium is identified within this mucin. The macroscopic defect of the ovarian surface described macroscopically is difficult to identify the sections. However, the extra-ovarian mucin is most likely of ovarian origin (via rupture). The sampled surface of the ovary shows no evidence of perforation by epithelial tumour.

B. Sections of the left ovary show a unilocular serous cyst adenoma. There is no evidence of architectural or cytologic atypia. The residual ovarian stroma includes a number of small serous epithelial inclusion cyst. There is extensive organising mucin on the surface of the ovary, without mucinous epithelium and without evidence of ovarian cystic rupture.

Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. There is no evidence of squamous or glandular atypia. Sections of the endometrium show inactive morphology. Several leiomyomas are confirmed, together with patchy adenomyosis. There is also extensive organising mucin on the surface of the uterus without mucinous epithelium.

C. Representative sections of the omentum confirm the macroscopic impression of foci of fat necrosis. As in Specimen A&amp;amp;B, there is extensive surface organising mucin without mucinous epithelium.

D. Sections show one benign reactive lymph node. There is no evidence of malignancy.

E. Sections show an aggregate of organising extracellular mucin. No mucinous epithelium is identified.

Comment (Specimen A-E): Clinical correlation is suggested to exclude a mucinous tumour elsewhere.
