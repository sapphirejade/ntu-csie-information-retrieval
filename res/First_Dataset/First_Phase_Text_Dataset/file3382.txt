CLINICAL:
Ovarian cancer.  Right tube and ovary frozen section.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot; consists of a predominately cystic mass measuring 120 x 95 x 25mm, with overlying fallopian tube measuring 70mm in length and 6mm in diameter.  The external surface of the mass is smooth.  The cyst wall thickness varies from 1 to 5mm across.  The cyst is multiloculated, however most of the cyst is composed of a 120mm cavity containing haemo-serous fluid.  The internal surface is smooth.  At one end of the mass is a solid fleshy nodule, 50mm across.  Also received attached to the mass is a sheet of probable peritoneum, 120 x 80 x 1mm.  There are several nodules attached to the surface of the peritoneum ranging from 3 to 15mm.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#8211; RS solid nodule for frozen section; 3 &amp;#8211; fallopian tube; 4 to 8 &amp;#8211; cystic component; 10 to 13 &amp;#8211; solid nodule; 14 &amp;amp; 15 &amp;#8211; peritoneal nodules.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, favour primary ovary.
Result to Anaesthetist by Dr C Monath and Dr C Mofield at 10:10am on 2/12/15.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot; consists of a predominately solid mass measuring 120 x 110 x 50mm, weighing 289g.  The external surface is predominately smooth, with an area of irregular tan tissue measuring 60mm across, affecting &amp;lt;20% of the external surface.  There is overlying fallopian tube measuring 30mm in length and 8mm in diameter.  Approximately 80% of the tumour has a tan fleshy cut surface with areas of haemorrhage.  The remainder of the tumour shows multiloculated cystic spaces.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#8211; tumour with fallopian tube; 3 to 5 &amp;#8211; cystic areas of tumour; 6 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;#8211; tumour with irregular external surface; 9 to 12 &amp;#8211; tumour.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Bladder peritoneum&amp;quot; consists of multiple fragments of peritonealised adipose tissue measuring 50 x 45 x 20mm in aggregate.  Several small peritoneal nodules are seen ranging from 3 to 5mm.  One fragment contains an irregular tan nodule measuring 10mm across.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#8211; peritoneum; 3 &amp;#8211; tan nodule.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omentum&amp;#8221; and consists of a piece of omentum measuring 190 x 90 x 15mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  RS 3 blocks.   (TO: KT; KT/ta 5/2/65)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Hammock):
A.  Sections show a carcinosarcoma / malignant mixed Mullerian tumour of the ovary.  Most of the tumour is composed of poorly differentiated serous carcinoma, with a small (10%) sarcomatous component (best seen in block A12).  Extensive necrosis is present.  Carcinoma is also present at the fimbrial end of the tube and within the separate piece of peritoneum.
B.  Sections show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of the ovary.  Extensive necrosis is present.  Carcinoma also involves the fimbrial end of the tube where there is also carcinoma in situ / STIC.
C.  Sections show several deposits of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
D.  The omentum contains one negative lymph node.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
MMMT of the right ovary and poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of the left ovary.
Carcinoma also involves the fimbrial ends of both tubes and the bladder peritoneum.
The omentum is negative.
