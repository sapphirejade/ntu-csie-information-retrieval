SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  (13.7.62)

CLINICAL:
Larger retroperitoneal fatty tumour extending to thigh.  Insulin dependent diabetic.  Cytogenetics.  Long suture inferior, double suture deep.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Single stitch inferior, double stitch deep retroperitoneal sarcoma" please note the specimen was received fresh and sampled for cytogenetics and tumour banking prior to formalin fixation, consists of 650g solid mass, 175 x 148 x 55mm.  There are two marking stitches as described on the label.  The outer surface is mostly smooth and shiny and appears to be covered by a thin capsule, except for a 70 x 55mm area on the deep aspect which appears to be slightly roughened.  The double suture marking the deep aspect is on the slightly roughened area.  The external surface is inked in four colours:  superficial green, lateral red, the roughened deep area blue and the remainder of the deep surface black.  Specimen is serially sliced into 14 slices from superior to inferior.  The cut surface is yellow and glistening.  There are patchy pale streaks throughout the specimen.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative sections slice 1 (superior margin); 3 - superficial margin slice 2; 4 - deep margin slice 2; 4 - reserveblock for tumour bank; 5 - lateral margin slice 3; 6 - medial margin slice 3; 7 - lateral margin slice 4; 8 - centre slice 4; 9 - centre slice 6; 10 - medial margin slice 7; 11 - centre slice 7; 12 - deep (roughened area) slice 9; 13 - deep (roughened area) slice 9; 14 - deep (roughened area) slice 10; 15 - deep (roughened area) slice 11; 16 - centre slice 11; 17 - medial slice 13; 18 & 19 - representative sections slice 14 (inferior margin).  Please see diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Makley):  
Sections show a well differentiated liposarcoma with a mixture of lipoma-like area and sclerosing area.  It is composed ofislands of adipocytes with varying cell sizes and intervening fibromyxoid stroma.  The adipocytes show focal nuclear atypia and hyperchromasia.  The stroma contains hyperchromatic atypical cells and thick walled vessels.  Very occasional lipoblasts and multinucleated stromal cells are present.  There is no tumour necrosis.  There are no dedifferentiated components.  The tumour focally extends to the roughened deep surface (inked blue).  
Representative slides are shown to Dr S Mccrae.
DIAGNOSIS:
Retroperitoneal tumour - Well differentiated liposarcoma

Cytogenetics report from ST VINCENT'S PATHOLOGY, BUNDABERG HOSPITAL's Hospital, SHOALHAVEN HEADS:
Reported by: S Anolick:  Validated by:  Dr S Musetti.
Specimen Type:  Tumour.
Preparation:
S-1
S-2 
S-3
S-4
Analysis:
Cells Counted			3
Band Resolution Level	<300
Karyotype:
39-46, add (4)(q36)[cp3]
Comment:
Only 3 metaphases were obtained.  Additional material of unknown origin was present on chromosome 4q, which identifies an abnormal clone, but other abnormalities cannot be excluded due to poor chromosome morphology.  The significance of this abnormality is not known.  This is an insufficient number of cells for a complete cytogenetic analysis.
