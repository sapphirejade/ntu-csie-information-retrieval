CLINICAL:
( L ) extended hemicolectomy transverse and sigmoid synchronous tumours.  Type 2 resp failure. ?infective exacerbation of undiagnosed COPD.

Note: The orientation of the transverse and sigmoid colon is confirmed with the registrar Dr JUSTIN HEIDLER by phone of the 30th of the 5th 2016 at 11:15am.

MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Extended left hemicolectomy and transverse sigmoid synchronous tumours histopath&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of large bowel. The transverse colon measures approximately 280mm in length x 30mm in diameter. The descending to sigmoid colon measures approximately 245mm in length x 30mm in diameter.  There is a portion of omentum (approximately 30 x 120 x 30mm) adherent to the transverse colon serosa.  The mesocolon attached to the transverse colon measures 200 x 60 x 20mm.  The mesocolon attached to the descending/sigmoid colon measures approximately 230 x 50 x 20mm.  The wall thickness of the bowel is up to 6mm.
On sectioning two tumours are identified. Tumour one (40 x 30) is in the transverse colon and is partially circumferential.  The tumour appears to involve the serosa and there is adherent omentum to the serosal surface. Tumour one margins: 100mm proximal, approximately 180mm from tumour two, and approximately 400 from the distal margin.
Tumour two (35 x 30mm) is in the sigmoid colon and is circumferential.  The tumour appears to involve the attached mesocolon. Tumour two margins: 320mm proximal, and 150mm from the distal surgical margin.
The proximal surgical margin is inked blue and the distal black.  No other lesions or polyps are present on the bowel mucosa.  Representative sections.
Blocks: 1 - proximal and distal margins; 2 to 5 - tumour one (transverse colon); 6 - normal bowel between tumour one and two approximately at splenic flexure; 7 and 8, 9 - tumour two (sigmoid colon); 10 - Tumour one apical lymph nodes as seen; 11 to 15 - Transverse mesocolon lymph nodes; 16 - Tumour two apical lymph nodes as seen; 17 to 22 - Sigmoid mesocolon lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof P Frerich):
BOWEL CANCER PROFORMA

Macroscopic Description - Tumour 1

Site of tumour: Transverse colon
Maximum tumour diameter:     40mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:    100 mm (proximal end)
Tumour perforation:     No

Microscopic Description - Tumour 1

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Poor (there is an admixed component of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma accounting for approximately 30% of the tumour volume)

Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
The depth of tumour invasion is difficult to assess as there is a florid fibroinflammatory reaction around the advancing edge of the tumour which merges with the muscularis propria. However, definite extension beyond the muscularis propria is identified in block 5. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis are present extending to the serosa, but no definite tumour invasion of serosal fat is identified.

Macroscopic description - Tumour 2

Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon
Maximum tumour diameter:   35 mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  150 mm (distal end)
Tumour perforation:     No

Microscopic Description - Tumour 2

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
There is an invagination of peritoneum in block 9 which is close to the edge of the carcinoma (approximately 0.5mm), but no definite evidence of peritoneal invasion is seen.

Tumour involvement of margins (both tumours)
Cut ends:  Not involved

Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved

Lymph nodes
Tumour 1: No evidence of malignancy is seen in 15 lymph nodes adjacent to tumour 1. (0/15)
Tumour 2: Metastatic carcinoma is identified in 3 out of 24 lymph nodes adjacent to tumour 2. (3/24)

The apical lymph nodes of both tumours show no evidence of malignancy. (0/1 and 0/1 respectively)

A single benign node was identified between the two tumours. (0/1)

Number of lymph nodes present: 42 (total)
Number of lymph nodes involved: 3

pN1b	Metastases in 2-3 regional LN


Lymphovascular invasion
Tumour 1 - No evidence of vascular invasion identified.
Tumour 2 - A focus suspicious for venous invasion is identified at the interface of tumour and serosal fat (block 8).

Perineural invasion
Not seen (both tumours)

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically


Background abnormalities/other comments
Numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas are present within the bowel wall adjacent to the transverse colon carcinoma. The section of bowel taken between the tumours shows no significant abnormality nor evidence of granulomatous inflammation, raising the possibility that these changes are locally related to the presence of tumour. Similar granulomas are also identified within benign regional lymph nodes.

Residual tumour status - Both tumours
R0	No residual tumour

Response to neoadjuvent therapy: N/A

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	- Tumour 1 (block 2)
MLH1		Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining

MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	- Tumour 2 (block 9)
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.

Diagnostic Summary &amp;#8211; TNM 7th Edition

Tumour 2: pT3     pN1b  pMx     R0

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION: Tumours lacking mutations in KRAS or NRAS exons 2,3 or 4 are nipre likely to respond to anti-EGFR antibody therapy (Douillard et al NEJM 2013; 369:1023-34). The significance of BRAFV600E mutation as a predictive marker for anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal carcinoma is controversial.

Although genetic testing is ultimately required to discriminate between Lynch syndrome and MSI-high sporadic  colorectal cancer (mostly associated with hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter), the presence of a BRAF V600E gene mutation strongly supports a sporadic tumour (College of American Pathologists, Ed 1.1. Oct 2013).

TEST DESCRIPTION:
This test profiles a broad range of somatic mutations from 4 common oncogenes (BRAF, EGFR, KRAS and NRAS) using OncoFOCUS&amp;#8482; with additional custom panel. This multi-gene parallel profiling is intended to assist the selection of targeted therapies for cancer patients. Mutation analysis is performed on DNA isolated from tumour tissue. The relevant target regions are amplified in 2 multiplex PCR reactions followed by 12 multiplex extensions. Any mutant allele is accurately identified by mass spectrometry. Any reported mutation is called with high confidence (i.e. the proportion of a mutant allele is 10% or more). This oncogene panel can detect over 300 mutations including the following clinically relevant mutations in the EGFR (NM&amp;#173;_005228), KRAS (NM_004985), BRAF (NM_004333) and NRAS (NM_002524) genes. For a full list of the mutations tested, please see http://agenabio.com/oncofocus-panel.

COMMENT:
&amp;#8226;Samples can contain a variable proportion of tumour cells to normal cells and there may also be
tumour cell heterogeneity. If tumour cells represent less than 20% of the cells analysed the sensitivity of the assay may be reduced.
&amp;#8226;All PCR based molecular diagnostic tests are subject to a low risk of non-amplification of one
allele due to primer binding site DNA variants. This can also lead to a false negative result.
&amp;#8226;The laboratory assumes an appropriate form of consent has been obtained.
