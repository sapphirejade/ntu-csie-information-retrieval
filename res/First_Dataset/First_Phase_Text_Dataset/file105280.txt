CLINICAL:
Post hysterectomy and bso for tubal cancer.  Now staging.  1.  Left lower abdominal wall biopsy; 2.  Sigmoid fat; 3.  Omentum; 4.  Left paracolic gutter nodule; 5.  Right pelvic sidewall nodule.  For primary debulking.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of omentum, 420 x 95 x 30mm.  On sectioning, there are two deposits of tumour measuring 9 and 40mm.  Blocks: 1 - larger deposit; 2 - smaller deposit; 3 - uninvolved omentum.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left lower abdominal wall biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 28 x 17 x 10mm, sectioned transversely.  AE 2 blocks.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sigmoid fat&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 40 x 25 x 8mm.  Sectioned transversely.  AE 2 blocks.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right pelvic sidewall nodule&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 32 x 18 x 13mm.  Sectioned transversely.  AE 2 blocks.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left paracolic gutter nodule&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 10 x 8 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block.  (TO:JB/eh 15/2/67)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Chinen):
A.  Sections show two separate foci of high grade serous adenocarcinoma.  The larger focus measures 40mm in diameter.  The carcinoma shows predominantly papillary architecture with widespread psammoma body type calcification.

B.  Sections show normal appearing fibrofatty tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.  Sections mature adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

D.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with foci of high grade serous adenocarcinoma.

E.  Sections show normal appearing smooth muscle and fibrous tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Omentum - High grade serous adenocarcinoma.

B.  Left lower abdominal wall biopsy - No significant abnormality.

C.  Sigmoid fat - No significant abnormality.
