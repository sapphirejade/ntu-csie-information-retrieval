MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL, DIAPHRAGM, COLON, SPLEEN, STOMACH, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Received in one bucket, multiple organs with disseminated white serosal thickening and confluent firm white serosal deposits, including;

A subtotal gastrectomy specimen including greater curve 170mm, lesser curve 80mm, with soft tissue towards the lesser curve up to 30mm.  The serosal surface with soft tissue at the lesser curve is extensively involved by serosal white tumour deposits invading the adipose issue and the gastric wall to approach the mucosa with no definite ulceration.  It is extensively marked towards the distal margin.

(1 proximal margin; 2 distal margin; 3 uninvolved mucosa; 4 antral serosal involvement  5 lesser curve soft tissue involvement;

Three segments of small bowel measuring 80x30mm, 90x20mm and 190x35mm and attached mesentery up to 15mm, 10mm and 20mm respectively.  The serosal surfaces are extensively involved by white deposits and thickening of the wall with involvement of the muscular layer and no definite mucosal ulceration   There are no intraluminal polyps or tumours.  Multiple white nodules are identified on the mesentery.

6 mesenteric involvement largest segment; 7 second largest segment; 8 representative smaller segment involvement;

A right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of a terminal ileum 70x35mm, caecum and ascending colon 140x110mm with mesentery up to 45mm.  At the anatomical site of the appendix, there is an elongated mass 60x15mm.  There is firm white serosal thickening and  white tumor deposits invading the mesentery and the mesoappendix to wrap the appendix lumen. No mucosal ulceration or intraluminal polyps are identified.

9 terminal ileum; 10 caecum; 11 ascending colon; 12 appendix TS mid and LS tip; 13&amp;amp;14 mesentery;

A transverse colon measuring 600mm in length and up to 60mm in circumference with attached mesentery up to 55mm and attached omentum ( up to 90 mm width) which is totally replaced by solid white tumor.  Towards the proximal end, there is a gallbladder measuring 90x40mm with adherent overlying serosal surface to the involved mesentery.  The mucosal surface of the gallbladder is green and granular.  The overlying tumour involves the outer surface of the colon and gallbladder mucosa with no definite intraluminal involvement.  Attached is an ill-defined segment of liver measuring 80x50x30mm with extensive capsular involvement invading into the underlying liver parenchyma. There are two areas of adherent liver tissue measuring 10x10mm and 20x15mm are attached on the outer surface of the tumour.  The possible margins are inked blue.

15 cystic duct and TS body gallbladder; 16 Gallbladder body involvement; 17&amp;amp;18 liver involvement; 19 rim of liver tissue with adjacent tumour [tumour block for tissue banking]; 20&amp;amp;21 TS colon; 22&amp;amp;23 omental disease;

A part of left colon 170x70mm with attached mesentery up to 50mm and adherent spleen 155x120x45mm.  The splenic capsule is thickened, white and diffusely involved by disease that involves the underlying splenic parenchyma.  Similar deposits are identified on the serosal surface of the attached bowel with no intraluminal involvement.

24&amp;amp;25 splenic involvement; 26 left colon disease;

A segment of bowel including left colon, sigmoid and rectum of a total length of 370mm.  The distal 150mm of the specimen is below the peritoneal reflection.  Attached is mesentery and mesocolon up to 50mm.  Multiple peritoneal strips are identified along the specimen to a maximum width of 110mm.  Disseminated hard white serosal involvements are seen across the specimen including the peritoneal reflection and invading into the mesorectal fat. The attached peritoneal strips have confluent involvement with tumor deposits. No intraluminal tumours are identified.  The tumour involves the bowel wall with no mucosal ulcerations or polyps.

27 sigmoid involvement; 28&amp;amp;29 continuous slice mesorectal involvement [radial margin black]; 30 peritoneal strips with disease;

Three pieces of tissue with glistening surface consistent with diaphragmatic peritoneal strips measuring 300x18mm, 210x150mm and 85x60mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 10mm.  Extensive involvement of the glistening surface by firm white deposits is identified.

31 largest fragment involved; 32 RS smaller fragments;

Multiple fibrofatty and firm white tissue fragments which appear to be involved by tumour deposits measuring 200x200x30mm in aggregate.

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. N. Vanwyhe)
Sections show disseminated epithelioid malignant mesothelioma with tubulopapillary architecture with transmural involvement of stomach and serosal and muscularis propria involvement of segments of small bowel, terminal ileum, caecum and appendix, transverse colon and rectosigmoid.

Epithelioid malignant mesothelioma is also seen involving the capsule of the liver with focal extension into liver parenchyma, splenic capsule, serosa of gallbladder and separately submitted peritoneal fragments, omentum and possibly diaphragmatic fragments.

Lymphovascular invasion by the mesothelioma is seen.  No sarcomatoid component is identified.

The gastric mucosa, small bowel mucosa and colonic mucosa show no intrinsic abnormality.  The liver parenchyma shows no intrinsic abnormality.  The splenic parenchyma is unremarkable.   Two lymph nodes recovered from the right hemicolectomy specimen show no evidence of tumour.

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive staining with Cam5.2, CK5/6, calretinin, EMA, WT-1, D2-40 (weak) with no staining for CK20, CEA or CK7.

Ki-67 shows a proliferative index of 30%.

DIAGNOSIS:
SMALL BOWEL, DIAPHRAGM, COLON, SPLEEN, STOMACH, PERITONEAL DISEASE,
- DISSEMINATED EPITHELIOID MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA.
