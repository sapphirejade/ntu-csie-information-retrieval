CLINICAL:
Right mastectomy and axillary dissection.  Transverseelliptical excision of areolar complex.  Suture at level 2 axillary node. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch lateral to axillary node", consists of a nipple containing, skin bearing mastectomy measuring 150mm )medial to lateral), 155mm (superior to inferior) x 50mm (superficial to deep) with axillary fat pad 95 x 58 x 32mm, weighing 485g in total.  An ellipse of skin is present 120 x 48mm showing no unusual features.  The nipple measures 15mm in diameterand appears unremarkable.  A 2mm pigmented papule is present on the areola at 3 o'clock.  A stitch marks the level 2.  Deep margin inked black, superior purple and the remaining blue.  Sectioning shows a circumscribed firm tumour in the lateral half extending from approximately 8-10 o'clock and measuring 50mm medial to lateral, 67mm superior to inferior and 25mm superficial to deep.  The tumour appears 15mm from the inferior margin, 17mm from the deep and at least 20mm from the superior margin.  There is an area of haemorrhage within the tumourwhich might be due to previous biopsy. Present at 7 o'clock there is a separated 6mm tumour which lies 10mm inferior to the main tumour.  There are also twowell circumscribed nodules/?tumours  at 6 o'clock, each 8mm in diameter which are 10mm and 25mm from the main tumour.  The remaining breast is mixed fibrofatty and no other lesions are identified.  Several lymph nodes are identified which some of them appears to be involved by tumour. 
Block 1 - nipple trisected; 2 - tissue deep to the nipple and pigmented lesion; 3-8 - section of tumour from superior to inferior with tumour satellitism in block 8;
 9 -  tumour, lateral; 10 -  tumour,medial; 11 - random upper outer quadrant; 12 - random lower outer quadrant; 13 & 14 -separated nodules (? Tumour); 15 - upper inner quadrant; 16 - lower inner quadrant; 17 - two nodes representative sections; 18 - one node, four pieces; 19 - four nodes; 20 - one node trisected; 21 - one node bisected; 22 - two nodes; 23 - one node bisected; 24 -  five nodes from level 2; 25 - section of tumour for tissue bank.  Please refer to attached diagram.

	80 mm pleomorphic LCIS, 6 mm deep margin, > 10mm other margins

ADDITIONAL REPORT,29/6/62:

Material was sent to Dr P Ikeda, HENTY MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Hospital, for HER-2 CISH testing, the results of which are as follows:
Her-2 in-situ hybridisation: (Her-2 CISH Invitrogen SPOT-Light assay, block 6)  
HER-2 CISH result: NEGATIVE(non-amplified/diploid).

Mean HER-2copy number per cell:  2.15
Scoring Criteria (ASCO/CAP recommendations):  
Non amplified (diploid) 1-2.5 copies.  Non amplified (polysomic) = 2.5 < 4 copies.  Equivocal = 4-6 copies.  Low level amplification = >6 but <10 copies.  High level amplified = 10 or more copies.
