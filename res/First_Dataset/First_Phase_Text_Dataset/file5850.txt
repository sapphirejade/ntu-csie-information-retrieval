HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Low grade appendix tumour 10years ago. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) peritonectomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE:&amp;quot;. Consists of gallbladder, omentum, peritoneum, gallbladder, right hemicolectomy,(no appendix), uterus with attached cervix, tubes adnexa, right ovary not easily identifiable and rectum.
Gallbladder measuring 80mm in length by 40mm in diameter. The serosa is smooth. The wall is up to 2mm thick. The mucosa is granular green in appearance. No stones found within the lumen.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).

Omentum -  A piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum measuring  300x250x35mm with mucinous deposits of tumour.

(3&amp;amp;4 RS omentum).

Separate pieces of tissue consistent with peritoneum measuring  altogether 220x120x10mm. On the surface are mucinous deposits of tumour five RS peritoneum.

(5 peritoneum)

Right hemicolectomy comprising of terminal ileum, caecum, ascending colon and attached mesocolic fat. No appendix present. It measures  165mm in length with proximal diameter of 20mm, distal diameter of 40mm, terminal ileum is 110mm, ascending colon is 60mm, caecum is up to 15mm in depth. On opening no lesion is identified. The serosal surface of the terminal ileum and caecum is roughened, proximal is inked green, distal black.

(6 proximal and distal margin; 7 section of roughened serosa overlying terminal ileum; 8 appendiceal orifice; 9-12 possible lymph node, one node each bisected).

Uterus with attached cervix, bilateral ovaries and attached section of large ?rectosigmoid weighing altogether 752g. The uterus with attached cervix weighs 90mm superior to inferior, 110mm anterior to posterior. The intercornual distance is difficult to assess. The ectocervix is 20x20mm with a slit like os 10mm. Segment of large bowel attached posteriorly is 260mm in length with maximum diameter of 32mm. On sectioning through the uterus with attached cervix, there is mucinous deposits of tumour with cystic areas filled with  mucin. The mucinous deposits affect mostly the posterior myometrium. Anteriorly is a leiomyoma which has a pale white whorled cut surface measuring up to 50mm.

(13 anterior cervix; 14 posterior cervix; 15&amp;amp;16 composite slices including leiomyoma; 17-20 posterior myometrium showing extensive mucin deposits; 21 posterior myometrium in relation to attached right ovary/large bowel; 22 ?left fallopian tube; 23 left ovary; 24 cyst superior to uterus filled with mucinous material; 25 ?right fallopian tube and cyst adjacent to fallopian tube ?ovary; 26 tumour block). RS (M-26/Gutshall/ht).

MICROSCOPIC:     (Dr. U. Douse)
Sections show low grade mucinous neoplasm comprising of dissecting extracellular mucin associated with  low grade mucinous epithelium involving the serosa of the terminal ileum, omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments. In addition there are extensive deposits of low grade mucinous neoplasm in the pelvis with a confluent mass replacing both ovaries and both fallopian tubes with direct extension into uterine myometrium and pouch of Douglas and into perirectal soft tissues.

The colonic and small bowel mucosa from the right hemicolectomy specimen and the rectal mucosa from the rectal resection show no focal abnormalities.
The cervix shows no significant abnormality.
The endometrium is inactive. The myometrium shows scattered benign leiomyomas.

Sections through the gallbladder show no significant abnormality.

Local lymph nodes examined from the right hemicolectomy specimen and from the omentum show no tumour.

No destructive tumour invasion with desmoplastic stroma is identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- DISSEMINATED LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM RESULTING IN PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI INVOLVING OMENTUM, SEROSA OF TERMINAL ILEUM, PERIRECTAL SOFT TISSUES, BOTH ADNEXAE WITH EXTENSION INTO UTERINE MYOMETRIUM AND POUCH OF DOUGLAS AND WITH INVOLVEMENT OF SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS.
