CLINICAL:
Previous 3C serous ovarian cancer &amp;#8211; pelvic recurrence.  HTN.  TIA.  High BMI.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left iliac fossa mass&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with attached muscle 95 x 85 x 40mm.  The cut surface reveals a solid cystic mass 65mm in maximum dimension.  Two representative sectionsfor frozen section.
Blocks:  1 &amp;#8211; frozen section; 2 &amp;#8211; frozen section; 3 to 10 &amp;#8211; representative sections of the tumour and muscle.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous carcinoma.
Result to Anaesthetist by Dr E Zaeske at 10:10am on 21/10/2014.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Sigmoid colon&amp;#8221; consists of a segment of large bowel with attached fat.  The large bowel measures 110 x 55mm.  The attached fibrofatty tissue measures 70mm in maximum dimension. The radial margin is inked blue. On the serosal surface multiple white nodules are identified ranging from 2 &amp;#8211; 15mm.  The mucosa is in grey colour.  There is an ulcerated tumour measuring 57 x 30mm.  The closest surgical margin is clear by 15mm macroscopically.  The cut sections through the tumour shows a white, firm infiltrative lesion extends to the radial surgical margin.  Both surgical margins appear clear macroscopically.  Seven lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3 &amp;#8211; 5mm.
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#8211; surgical margin; 3 &amp;#8211; vascular margin; 4 to 6 &amp;#8211; tumour; 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;#8211; representative section of tumour with closest radial margin; 9 &amp;amp; 10 &amp;#8211; representative section of the nodules on the serosal surface; 11 &amp;#8211; four lymph nodes; 12 &amp;#8211; three lymph nodes.  (RM/rt 24.12.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Blackman):
A &amp;amp; B.  Sections show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma (high grade).  The tumour cells with high grade nuclei are arranged in solid nests and sheets with focal cystic change and necrosis.  Papillary architecture is focally present.  In the specimen A, the tumour invades into the skeletal muscle.  In the specimen B, the tumour involves the submucosa, muscle wall and mesentery of sigmoidcolon.  Lymphovascular invasion is seen (block A9).  Serosal involvement is seen.  The overlying colonic mucosa is unremarkable.  The colonic resection margins are unremarkable.  Six (6) lymph nodes are identified within the mesentery.  5of 6 lymph nodes are involved by tumour metastasis.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left iliac fossa mass &amp;#8211; Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
B.  Sigmoid colon &amp;#8211; Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
