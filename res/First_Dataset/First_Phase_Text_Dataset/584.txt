CLINICAL:
85yr old woman with endometrial cancer (favour serous adenocarcinoma).  
Frozen section and cervical biopsy.  TAH/BSO/omentectomy/peritoneal washings, pelvic lymph node dissection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervical biopsy" consists of a piece of tissue 3 x 2 x 1mm with possible pale pink mucosa on one side and 3 x 1mm.There is an irregularly shaped stringy piece of tissue 2mm in maximum extension.  AE for frozen section.   
Blocks: 1 - frozen section AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Endocervical tissue.  No malignancy in frozen sections.  
Reported to Dr Oza by Dr O Yamaki at 10.18am on 27/3/13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus,cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes andovaries weighing 63g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 40 x 28mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  There is a friable haemorrhagic area ofendometrium 10 x 10mm in the posterior uterus with a maximum thickness of 3mm over a total thickness of 13mm.  The myometrium contains several fibroids up to 15mm in maximum dimension.  All appear unremarkable.   The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length with a maximum diameter of 7mm.  The right ovary measures 15 x 8 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 15 x 10 x 7mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 -full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - remainder of thickened endometrium AE; 9 - retentive leiomyoma; 10 - right tube; 11 - right ovary; 12 - left tube; 13 - left ovary.  
Extra blocks 14 to 25: rest of endometrium embedded.
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Cervical biopsy" consists of two biopsies 2 and 3mm.   AE 1 block.
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 60mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 15 to 35mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node bisected; 3 & 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned.  
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of two pieces of unorientated fatty tissue 20 and 50mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5 to 42mm.
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected; 3 to 5 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common lymph node" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 50mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5 to 30mm. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node bisected.  
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 75mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified measuring from 6 to 35mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 to 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 5 to 7 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 60mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 10 to 35mm. 
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 to 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
 
I.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph nodes" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 45mm in maximum dimension.  Two lymph nodes are identified from 4 to 35mm.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 to 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned.  
J.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental tissue measuring 200 x 70 x 15mm.  No suspicious areas identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.   (TO: PC; SV/ta  30/5/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Karagiannes):
A. Sections show endocervical tissue with no evidence of malignancy.

B. The entire endometrium has been submitted for examination.
Sections show weekly proliferative endometrium and an endometrial polyp.
There is no evidence of residual malignancy.
Several benign leiomyomas are seen in the myometrium.
The cervix is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of HPV effect, dysplasia or malignancy.
The fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
Representative sections shown to Dr ELMER GELSTON.
C. Sections show squamous and endocervical mucosa with no evidence of HPV effect, dysplasia or malignancy.
D. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
E. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidencemalignancy.
F. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
G. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
H. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
I. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
J. Sections show omental fat with no evidencemalignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Cervical biopsy: no evidence ofmalignancy
B. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
- Weakly proliferative endometrium and benign endometrial polyp, noevidence of residual malignancy
- Cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable
C. Cervical biopsy: no evidence of malignancy
D to I. Left external iliac, left obturator, left common iliac, right external iliac, right obturator, right common iliac: 21 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
J. Omentum: no evidence of malignancy
