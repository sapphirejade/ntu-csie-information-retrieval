Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries weighing 95g.  The uterus measures 105 x 55 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The anterior cervical margin is inked blue and the posterior surgical margin is inked black.  On sectioning, the endometrial cavity is expanded by a villiform tumour measuring up to 14mm in depth, through a myometrium measuring 20mm in thickness.  The tumour extends into the lower uterine segment, but does not appear to invade the cervix.  The myometrium contains a prominent fibroid at the fundal aspect measuring 35mm in maximum dimension; no necrosis or haemorrhage is identified.  Additionally, there are three further fibroids all with a similar gross appearance.  The left fallopian tube measuring 45mm in length with a diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 22 x 18 x 12mm, with an unremarkable cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with a diameter of 5mm; the fimbrial end is challenging to identify.  The right ovary measures 20 x 18 x 11mm, with an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 5 - composite mid line LS of posterior uterus and cervix (3 - ?deepest invasion; 4 and 5 - fibroid); 6 and 7 - LS posterior lower uterine segment, ?deepest invasion; 8 to 11 - composite midline LS anterior uterus and cervix; 9 to 11 - representative fibroids;  12 - LS complete fimbrial end left fallopian tube and mid TS; 13 - representative left ovary; 14 - LS complete (presumed) fimbrial end right fallopian tube, mid TS; 15 - representative right ovary.  (TO: JB;JB/vo 1.11.66); 16 to 19 - TS remaining identifiable fallopian tubes, tubes AE.  (TO: JB; JB/ta 6/12/66)
MICROSCOPIC (Report by Dr K Creswell):
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 10mm through a wall 16mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
The myometrium shows several leiomyomas.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.
The right tube shows two tiny foci of carcinoma in situ, strongly positive for p53 with increased Ki67 staining.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed. MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
COMMENT:
Incidental carcinoma in situ / serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is present in the right tube.  Please exclude breast cancer and BRCA in this patient.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 10mm through a wall 16mm thick, focal lymphvascular invasion present, cervix uninvolved.
The right tube shows tiny foci of carcinoma in situ / serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (see comment).
