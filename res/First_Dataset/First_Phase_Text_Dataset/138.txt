B.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum and left tube and ovary" consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibroadipose tissue, 65 x 20 x 15mm with foci of haemorrhagic necrotic tumour.  No definitive ovary or fallopian tube identified.  
TSAE 5 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall" consists of fibroadipose tissue, 45 x 35 x 20mm attached to cyst wall tissue, 68 x 32 x 14mm.
Blocks:  1 - representative fibroadipose tissue; 2 & 3 - representative cyst wall tissue.
