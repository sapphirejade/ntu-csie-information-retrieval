CLINICAL:
Left testicular cancer.  Left testis and cord.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left testis and cord" consists of a testis measuring 60 x 50 x 30mm and weighing 52.5g.  There is an attached spermatic cord measuring 70mm in length with a maximum diameter of 15mm.  On sectioning there isa well circumscribed cream and fleshy mass measuring 30 x 25mm.  The tumour appears to abut tunica albuginea at the inferior pole.  The tumour appears well clear of the rete testis and epididymis. The uninvolved testis appears unremarkable. Approximately 80% of tumour embedded.
Blocks:  1 - spermatic cord margin; 2 - mid spermatic cord; 3 - proximal spermatic cord; 4 to 14 - LS of tumour adjacent to tunica albuginea; 15 - rete testisand epididymis; 16 to 21 - composite blocks representing a full face of testis; 22 -further representative tumour; 23- representative normal testis of away from tumour.  
(QX/rt 16.12.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Falt & registrar Dr L LEIGH-Langfitt):
Sections of the testis show pure seminoma.  The features are as follows:  
Histologic type:  Seminoma (pure)
	
Scarring:  Absent 
Syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells:  Absent
Maximum tumour size (maximum dimension):  30mm
Extent of tumour
Rete testis invasion:  Absent
Epididymis invasion:  Absent 
Tunica albuginea invasion:  Absent
Tunica vaginalis invasion:  Absent
Spermatic cord invasion:  Absent
Scrotal wall invasion:  Absent
Lymphovascular invasion:  Absent
Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN):  Present 
	Type:  Not otherwise specified	
	Extent:  Focal (minor)
Lymph node status:  Not sampled
AJCC Tumour staging category (pT) (7th edition):  T1
Tumour limited to the testis and epididymis without vascular/lymphatic invasion; tumour may invade into the tunicaalbuginea but not the tunica vaginalis 
DIAGNOSIS:
Left testis:
- 30mm pure seminoma
- Tumour limited to testis
- pT1 (AJCC 7th Ed)
