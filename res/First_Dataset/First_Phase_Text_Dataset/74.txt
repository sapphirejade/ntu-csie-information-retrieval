The uterus measures 100 x 70 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 42 x 35mm and is unremarkable.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 18mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium appears trabeculated and there are fibroids measuring from 5 to 7mm in maximum dimension.  One fibroid has a centre area of haemorrhage.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length x 8 x7mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 28 x 20 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 33 x 22 x 20mm and has a smooth lined cyst measuring 15mm in maximum dimension which is filled with haemoserous fluid.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 9 & 10 - haemorrhagic ?fibroid posteriorly; 11 to 13 - right fallopian tube; 14 to 16 - right ovary; 17 to 19 - left fallopian tube; 20 to 24 - left ovary.
