CLINICAL:
Adenosarcoma cervix.  Rad hyst.  LN sampling.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 147g in total.  The uterus measures 50 x 90 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The specimen includes a vaginal cuff measuring 30 x 50mm posteriorly and 30 x 15mm anteriorly.  The vaginal cuff margin is inked black.  The cervix is unremarkable on sectioning. On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 19mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 70 x 10 x 6mm and the right ovary measures 45 x 25 x 15mm.  The right ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55 x 10 x 10mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 25 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.   
Blocks: 1 to 29 - posterior cervix and cervical canal AE; (1 & 2 - (paired blocks) 3 & 4 (paired blocks) 5 & 6 (paired blocks) 7 & 8 (paired blocks) 9 & 10 (paired blocks) 11 & 12 (paired blocks) 13 & 14 (paired blocks) 15 & 16 (paired blocks) 19 & 20 (paired blocks) 21 & 22 (paired blocks) 23 & 24 (paired blocks) 25 & 26 (paired blocks) 27 & 28 (paired blocks) embedded from right to left; 30 to 42 - LS of the anterior cervix and cervical canal; (30 & 31 (paired blocks) 32 & 33 (paired blocks) 34 & 35 (paired blocks) 36 & 37 (paired blocks) 38 & 39 (paired blocks) 41 & 42 (paired blocks); 43 to 44 - LS through the anterior uterine body; 45 to 47 - full LS through posterior uterine body; 48 - LS of the fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube; 49 - TSright fallopian tube; 50 - representative right ovary; 51 - LS of the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube; 52 - TS of the left fallopian tube; 53 - representative left ovary.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph nodes" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 25 x 15 x 5mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.   AE 1 block.
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic node" consists of firoadipose tissue 30 x 20 x10mm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  AE 2 blocks.  
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator nerve" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 80 x 45 x 15mm.  No definite nerve identified.  AE 8 blocks. 
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of omentum measuring 130 x 50 x 5mm.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.   (NJ/ta 22/7/63) 
  

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Phelps):
A. The entire cervix has been embedded.
Sections from the cervix show a polyp base lined by granulation tissue (A9 and A34).  There is no evidence of residual malignancy present.
The remainder of the cervix shows no evidence of human papilloma virus effect or dysplasia.
The endometrium is inactive.  There is no evidence of hyperplasia or malignancy.
The ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
Representative sections shown to Dr GEOFFREY PRODOEHL.
B. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show 8 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Sections show omental fat with no evidence malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
- Polyp base in cervix with no evidence of residual malignancy
- Fallopian tubes and ovaries unremarkable
B. Left pelvic lymph nodes: 5 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy
C. Right pelvic lymph nodes: 3 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
D. Left obturator lymph nodes:  8 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
E. Omentum: no evidence of malignancy
