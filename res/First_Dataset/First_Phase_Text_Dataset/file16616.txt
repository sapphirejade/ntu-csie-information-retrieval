Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Low anterior resection.  Converted to APR.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;AP resection&amp;quot;, received opened, and consists of large bowel, rectum and anal canal measuring 220mm in length and variable circumference (60mm proximally, 40mm distally), with attached fat to a maximum width of 20mm.  The anterior peritoneal reflection is 100mm from the distal margin, and the dentate line is 30mm from the distal margin.  There is a possible defect in the perirectal fat over the left posterolateral aspect, 40 x 20mm (inked red).  The anterior resection margin is inked blue and posterior black.  Within the rectum is a polypoid tumour, 47 x 30 x 21mm.  The entire tumour is located 25mm below the anterior peritoneal reflection, 5mm above the dentate line and is 35mm clear of the distal margin.  On sectioning, no definite macroscopic invasion is identified.  Several polyps, up to 2mm, are seen in the mucosa.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the perirectal fat, up to 12mm.
Blocks: 1 - LS proximal margin, with 2mm polyp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - LS distal margin; 4 to 17 - tumour serially embedded from distal to proximal (6/7, 8/9, 10/11, 12/13, 14/15 - paired sections; 17 - polyp fragments detached on sectioning); 18 - apical lymph node; 19 to 28 - lymph nodes above peritoneal reflection (21, 22, 24, 27 - one lymph node in each block); 29 to 24 - lymph nodes below peritoneal reflection (30 &amp;amp; 34 - one lymph node in each block).

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Short proximal, long lateral, double inside at 2 o&amp;apos;clock margin&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue with orienting sutures.  The specimen is 50mm (proximal to distal) x 20mm (inner to outer) x 10mm (anterior to posterior).  The inside 2 o&amp;apos;clock margin is inked blue, opposite outside margin black and posterior red.  No discrete lesion is seen.  Serially embedded in 9 blocks from proximal to distal.  AE.   (TO: LN;LN/vo 3.12.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Lapinski):
A &amp;amp; B.  SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA
Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Rectum, below anterior peritoneal reflection.
Maximum tumour diameter:  47mm.
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  35mm.
Tumour perforation:  No

Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT1	Limited to submucosa

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  8mm (A8).  The additional soft tissue submitted from the 2 o&amp;apos;clock margin (specimen B) shows no evidence of malignancy.

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:	Thirty-six (36).
Number of lymph nodes involved:	Nil (0).

pN0	No regional LN metastasis

Lymphovascular invasion
Absent

Perineural invasion
Absent

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
The invasive carcinoma arises from a tubulovillous adenoma.
An incidental hyperplastic polyp in the colon is sampled.

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Not applicable

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Abdominoperineal resection:
-  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum, pT1.
-  Thirty-six negative lymph nodes (0/36).
B.  Additional 2 o&amp;apos;clock margin:  No evidence of malignancy.
