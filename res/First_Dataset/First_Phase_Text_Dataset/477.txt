Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Past history WLE and DXR for (L) breast c/a.  Small recurrence palpable to 1 o'clock, invasive Ca on core biopsy.WLE (re-excision).  Specimen marked long lateral, short superior, medium medial.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left breast lesion marking sutures; long lateral, medium medial, short superior" consists of an orientated wide local excision measuring 70mm (medial to lateral) x 64mm (inferior to superior) x 24mm (superficial to deep).  The deep margin is inked black, the superficial/inferior margin is inked blue, superficial/superior margin is inked red.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the parasagittal plane into 12 slices from slice 1 medial to slice 12 lateral.  A firm cream poorly circumscribed lesion identified in slice 6 measuring 5mm (medial to lateral) x 6mm (inferior to superior) x 5mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is as follows superficial 3mm, deep 5mm, superior, 20mm and inferior 30mm and well clear of both the medial and lateral margins.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - slice 6; 4 - representative slice 1; 5 and 6 - slice 3; 7 and 8 - slice 5; 9 and 10 - slice 7; 11 and 12 - slice 9; 13 and 14 - slice 11; 15- representative slice 12; Two markers on block 1, please refer to attached diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof D Namauu):
Invasive carcinoma:
Site: 1 o'clock left breast
Type: Infiltrating carcinoma with some overlapping features between ductal and lobular carcinoma. The E-Cadherin stain is positive, consistent with infiltrating duct carcinoma.
Invasive tumour size: 8mm
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 2
Tubules:   3   Nuclei:  2     Mitoses:  1    Mitotic rate:      3/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion:  Present at edge of tumour (block 9)
	    
DCIS component:  
DCIS:  Present in tumour and adjacent breast tissue. A 7mm focus is presentin sections taken away from the main tumour, towards medial end of specimen in slice 3.
Maximum extent of DCIS: 7mm focus of high grade DCIS in slice 3; 4mm focus of intermediate grade DCIS in slice 5.
Nuclear grade:  High andintermediate grade.
Architecture: Comedo 
Necrosis:   Comedo
Calcification: Present
Degree of DCIS in tumour: <25%  
DCIS in adjacent tissue:  Present 
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component: The invasive carcinoma is clear of the excision margins. The closest margins are 3mm at superficial/superior, red inked surface and 4mm at black inked, deep margin.
In-situ component: High gradeDCIS in slice 3 extends to within 0.2mm of the deep margin.  The focus in slice 5 is 5mm from the deep margin. The other margins appear well clear.
Receptors (Block 1): 
ER:  Strong positive
	100% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining:  Strong
PR:  Strong positive
	80% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining: Strong  
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7):Negative (1+). SISH in progress. 
Ki-67 index: Low, <5%.
Nipple:  
Not present
LCIS / ALH:    
Foci of ALH are present, including involvement of a fibroadenoma.
Miscellaneous:
The invasive carcinoma is situated within dense fibrous tissue, possiblyrepresenting scar tissue. The remaining breast tissue shows lobular atrophy and hyalinization, possibly relating to previous radiotherapy.
Sentinel lymph node(s):
No lymph nodes arepresent.
DIAGNOSIS: 
LEFT BREAST: 
	8MM INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, GRADE 2. ER/PR POSITIVE
	DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (INCLUDING EXTREMELY CLOSE DEEP MARGIN)
	LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT

ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (3.9.63)
Blocks were sent to ROYAL REHABILITATION HOSPITAL - COORABEL/MOORONG Hospital for Her2 ISH analysis, Dr D Triolo reports:
HER2 IHC Result:   Negative (1+).
Signal Detection has been performed for the Her2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) controlusing the Ventanta INFORM Her2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche). 
Her2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (non-amplified, diploid). 
Mean Her2 copy number per cell: 2.6.
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell:  1.5.
HER2/CEP17 ratio:  1.7.
SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):
Negative:  HER2/CEP17 <1.8.
Equivocal:  HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2.
Positive:  HER2/CEP17 >2.2.
