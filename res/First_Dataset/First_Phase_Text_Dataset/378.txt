ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (2.6.63)

CLINICAL:
Right ductal breast Ca on core.  30mm 12 o'clock 3cm FN.  R breast Ca 12 o'clock.  Internal mammory node (one node).  Level 2 R axillary SN.  Lateral R breast tissue - hot + blue.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary sentinel lymph node" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 30 x 25 x 10mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified from 4 to 12mm.  AE 2 blocks. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Tumour right breast 12 o'clock short stitch towards nipple, long stitch lateral, medium medial" consists of a orientated wide local excision with three sutures in situ designated measuring 62mm (medial to lateral) x 55mm (inferior to superior) x27mm (superficial to deep).   The deep margin is inked black, superficial margin green and the superior margin blue.  Specimen is serially sectioned in a parasagittal plain into ten slices, from slice one lateral to slice ten medial.  A cream firm poorly circumscribed lesion is identified in slices three to eight.  The tumour measures 38mm (medial to lateral) x 22mm (inferior to superior) x 15mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margin is as follows: deep 3mm, inferior 5mm, superior 20mm, superficial 7mm, lateral 15mm and well clear of the medial margin.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - slice one; 6 & 7 - slice two; 8 to 10 - slice three; 11 to 13 - slice four; 14 to 16 - slice five; 17 to 19 - slice six; 20 to 22 - slice seven; 23 to 25 - slice eight; 26 to 27 - slice nine; 28 to 31 - slice ten.  AE. Please refer to attached diagram. 
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary breast tissue" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 30 x 25 x 15mm.  Serially sectioned AE 3 blocks.
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Internal mammary node" consists of four fragments of fatty tissue from 3 to 4mm.  AE 1 block.   (TO: QA; AZ/ta  14/6/63)

ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (2.6.63)
Blocks were sent to MERCY HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN Hospital for Her2 ISH analysis, Dr C Mcsharry reports:
HER2 IHC Result:   1+ at GEORGE TOWN HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY CENTRE.
Signal Detection has been performed for the Her2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventanta INFORM Her2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roache). 
Her2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (non-amplified, diploid). 
Mean Her2 copy number per cell: 2.3.
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell:  1.3. 
HER2/CEP17 ratio:  1.77.
SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):
Negative:  HER2/CEP17 <1.8.
Equivocal:  HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2.
Positive:  HER2/CEP17 >2.2.
