Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
?Adenosarcoma of uterus.  SOB.  ?endometrial adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 256g.  The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 70mm and has a smooth nodular shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in thickness. There is no endometrial tumour or polyp.  The myometrium of the anterior body measures up to 19mm.  The myometrium shows multiple fibroids measuring from 5 to 60mm.  The largest fibroid is in the anterior body measuring 60mm across and is calcified (placed in decal).
The right fallopian tube measures 70mm in length with and outer diameter of 6mm.There is a attached clip. The right ovary measures 23mm x 12 x 6mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with an outer diameter of 6mm.  There is an attached clip.  The left ovary measures 18mm x 12mm x 6mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full longitudinal sections of posterior body and cervix; 6 to 25 - all of endometrium plus RS of fibroids on the posterior body; 26 to 28 - right adnexa; (26 and 27 - fallopian tube, 28 - RS of ovary); 29 to 30 - left adnexa (29 - fallopian tube; 30 - ovary); 31 to 36 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix (no serosal surface on this block due to large fibroid which is calcified); 37 to 42 - all of the anterior endometrium; 43 - representative sections of the serosal surface; 44 and 45 - RS of the central part of the large fibroid in the anterior body.
All endometrium embedded.


MICROSCOPIC (Report by Dr S Talamo):
The previous report 73I92612 is noted.
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and shows no residual polyp or tumour.  The myometrium shows numerous leiomyomas.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes:  Leiomyomas. No endometrial lesion present.
