CLINICAL:
Re-excision lesion right breast - marking stitch long lateral, short superior, medium medial. 
(Previous LCIS - 33H27126).
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast", consistsof an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue with three sutures for orientation: short superior, medium medial, long lateral.  It measures 80mm medial to lateral, 70mm superficial to deep margin and 70mm superior to inferior.  At the superficial margin there is a cavity measuring 45 x 35mm. The superior margin is inked red, inferior margin green, superficial margin blue, deep margin black.  On sectioning the cavity is identified on slices 5-10. The tissue surrounding the cavity has a fibrofatty appearance.  The cavity side is inked yellow. The specimen is AE according to the attached diagram.  
Block 1-4 - medial margin (slice 1); 4-8 - slice 2; 9-14 - slice 3; 15-20 - slice 4; 21-26 - slice 5; 27-31 - slice 6; 32-37 - slice 7; 38-42 - slice 8; 43-45 - slice 9; 46-48 - slice 10; 49-50 - slice 11 (lateral margin).  (TO: LV: SL/ec 2.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Camara) 
The re-excision specimen shows widespread LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ)/ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia) some of which areassociated with foci of calcification.  There is also widespread columnar cell change some showinghyperplasia and microcalcification.  A small old 8mm fibroadenoma is also present as well as focal microcystic change with calcification and apocrine metaplasia.  The specimen has been totally blocked and there is no evidence of infiltrating carcinoma or DCIS.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast - re-excision:
-	LCIS, columnar cell change, microcalcification;
-	No DCIS or infiltrating carcinoma.
