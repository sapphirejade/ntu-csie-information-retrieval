CLINICAL:
Pancreatic cancer - liver lesion.  ?Liver metastasis.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Liver biopsy" consists of two pieces of tissue 10 x 10 x 9mm and 10 x 12 x 12mm.  The external surface is inked blue.  One piececontains a central hard pink nodule 8 x 5mm (nodule 1) and the other piece contains a grey nodule 4 x 4mm (nodule 2).  Both nodules embedded for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section nodule 1; 2 - frozen section nodule 2; 3 - remainder nodule 1; 4 - remainder nodule 2.  AE.  (NC/cc  27/4/63) 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma.
Phone result by Dr D Roggensack/Dr D Ventimiglia to anaesthetist at 11.48am on 22/2/13.
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Chauvin): 
Sections show an 8mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with pancreatic origin.  The lesion is composed of irregularly shaped glands lined by tumour cells with acutely markedly pleomorphic nuclei, surrounded by desmoplastic stroma.  Tumour involving bile ducts is seen. The lesion extends to the edge of the specimen.  There is no surface serosal involvement. The tumour cells are positive for CK7. Focal weak staining is seen for TTF-1. CK20 and CDX2 are negative.
The adjacent liver shows mild macrovesicular steatosis.  Bile pigment is present in the zone 3 canaliculi and hepatocytes in keeping with cholestasis. A small 1.5mm bile duct hamartoma is present beneath the serosal surface.
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver biopsy: metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with pancreatic origin
