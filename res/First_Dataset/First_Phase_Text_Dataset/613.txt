CLINICAL:
G1 4+3 CaP.  Radical prostatectomy, L/seminal vesicle.  BL pelvic LN. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate", consists of one prostate measuring up to 40 x 25 x 35mm, weighing 20.2g.  The right vas measures 20mm, the left vas measures 21mm, the right seminal vesicle measures 17mm.There is no left seminal vesicle attached.  Anterior inked green, right side inked black, left side inked blue.  The prostate is transversely sectioned into three slices.  Slice 1(apex), slice 3 (base) are further parasagittally sectioned.  Slice 2 is bisected.  Specimen AE.
Block 1-9 - slice 1 apex from right to left; 10 & 11 - slice 2; 12-19 - slice 3 base from right to left; 20 - right vas bisected; 21 - left vas bisected; 22 - right seminal vesicle bisected. AE 22 blocks. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node", consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring up to 50 x 35 x 15mm. There is a suture attached. There is one node measuring up to 20mm.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node", consists of one irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue with suture attached measuring up to 70 x 20 x 10mm.  
Block 1- ? one distorted lymph node; 2 -four possible lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Portion of left seminal vesicle", consists of a portion of seminal vesicle measuring up to 10mm.  BAE 1 block.   (TO: WG; LF/ec  21.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr U Surwillo 22.2.2062)
A -D.  The prostate shows prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for prostate carcinoma follows:

SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR PROSTATIC ACINAR ADENOCARCINOMA
Histological type: Prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour location:
Dominant nodule: Extends from the prostate base to apex.
	Smaller nodules: Scattered small foci of adenocarcinoma are also present. 

Volume/Size:	0.832ml (16mm x 13mm x 10mm x 0.0004) 
Gleason score: 4 + 3 = 7 (80% pattern 4). 
Extraprostatic extension: Not identified.
Surgical margins:
Inferior (apex): Less than 0.1mm to the diathermied margin (A7) (Gleason pattern 4) (A7).
Posterior: 0.60mm (A7). 
Anterosuperior: 1.0mm (A15).
Anterior: 1.1mm (A17).
Superior: 2.5mm (A15).
Left: 5.5mm (A11).
Right: >10mm (A10).
Perineural invasion: Focalperineural invasion is present. 
Seminal vesicles: No evidence of seminal vesicle involvement.
Lymph nodes:
Right pelvic lymph node (specimen B): No evidence of malignancy in one lymph node (0/1). 
	Left pelvic lymph node (specimenC): No evidence of malignancy in five lymph nodes (0/5).
