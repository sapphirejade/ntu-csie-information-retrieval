CLINICAL:
Sigmoid cancer.  Nil mets, nil perforation - lap anterior resection.  A few peritoneal lesions ?cystic ?Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sigmoid colon&amp;quot; consists of a segment of large bowel and rectum, 250mm in length and 55mm circumference, with mesocolon 120mm in width.  The peritoneal reflection is not included.  Within the sigmoid colon is a circumferential tumour, 45 x 45 x 5mm.  The tumour is 80mm clear of the proximal margin and 120mm clear of the distal margin.  The tumour infiltrates through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The tumour also appears to extend to the serosal surface.  There are a few 1mm serosal nodules overlying the tumour (inked blue).  No other peritoneal nodules are identified.  There is a small 3mm mucosal polyp distal to the tumour.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1- proximal margin; 2- distal margin; 3 - tumour with uninvolved bowel; 4 - tumour (reserved block); 5 to 7 - tumour extending to serosal surface; 8 to 10 - tumour infiltrating pericolicfat; 11 - apical lymph node; 12 - small mucosal polyp; 13 to 16 - one lymph node in each block; 17 to 27 - multiple lymph nodes.

N/A.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining.
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
