CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrial adenocarcinoma.  Intermittent PV spotting.  Pelvic US ET = 3mm but curettage adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix, (R) + (L) tubes/ovaries" consists of a partly opened uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 108g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 45 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Arising within the endometrial cavity there is a fungating cream tumour measuring 35 x 25mm anteriorly and 40 x 25mm posteriorly.  On sectioning, the tumour appears to invade 3mm into the myometrium which is 15mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains at least two fibroids measuring 5 and 11mm across.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 8mm in external diameter.  The fimbrial end is not identified.  Its serosa has a congested appearance.  The right ovary measures 16 x 10 x 10mm and appears grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 15mm in external diameter.  Its cut surface has a predominantly cystic appearance.  The left ovary also appears grossly normal and measures 15 x 7 x 6mm.  Representative sections in twenty-four blocks.: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 7 - anterior body further representative sections; 8 to 12 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 13 to 15 - posterior body further representative sections; 16 to 18 - right fallopian tube AE; 19 - right ovary BAE; 20 to 23 - left fallopian tube AE; 24 - left ovary BAE. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 8mm and 35 x 30 x 14mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 5 to 13mm across.  Lymph nodes AE three blocks. 
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 & 3 - largest node bisected.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 43 x 30 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 40mm across.  Lymph nodes AE three blocks. 
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2& 3 - largest node divided into four.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac" consists of three irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring from 15 x 12 x 10mm to 40 x 15 x 15mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 5 to 20mm across.  Lymph nodes AE four blocks. 
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one lymph node bisected in each; 4 - two lymph nodes.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring20 x 10 x 10mm and 25 x 13 x 10mm containing a single 20mm lymph node.  BAE one block.   (CT/cc  14/2/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Holtman): 
A.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximumdepth of invasion of 5mm through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both tubes show a hydrosalpinx.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.
B.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 5mm through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.Cervix uninvolved.  Twelve (12) lymph nodes are negative.
