CLINICAL:
Abdominoperineal resection.  MRI shows T2N2 rectal Ca.  Has had chemo radiotherapy.   
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Abdominoperineal resection" consists of a segment of large bowel comprising of distal part of sigmoid colon, rectum and anus measuring 260mm in total length and 30mm in diameter.  The attached mesentery measures 50mm in maximal width.  Onopening there is an ulcerated tumour abuts the dentate line and 45mm below the anterior peritoneal reflection.  The tumour is 25mm in diameter and appears to invade into the muscularis propria.  The tumour is 40mm from the distal surgical margin (rectum) and is 4mm to the closest circumferential margin.  Elsewhere the bowel mucosa appears normal aside from a few diverticula near the proximal end.  
Blocks:  1 - proximal surgical margin; 2- diverticula and normal bowel; 3- distal surgical margin; 4 to 13 - left anterior portion of tumour (4&5 - paired blocks, 8&9 - paired blocks; 10&11 - paired blocks; 12&13- paired blocks); 14 to 18 - right anterior portion of tumour (15&16 - paired blocks, 17&18- paired blocks) tumour AE; 19 to 23 - lymph nodes from below peritoneal reflection (19 - four lymph nodes, 20 - three lymph nodes, 21 - one lymph node bisected, 22 - one lymph node bisected, 23 - ?lymph nodes); 24 to 28 - lymph nodes from above peritoneal reflection (24 - one lymph node bisected; 25 - four possible lymph nodes, 26 - ?lymph nodes; 27 - ?two lymph nodes; 28 - ?four lymph nodes).  (VR/mm 26.7.63)

Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT2	Tumour more than 2cm but not more than 5cm in greatest dimension
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  3mm (block 13)
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  10
Number oflymph nodes involved:  2
pN1	Metastases in peri-rectal lymph nodes
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Diverticular disease within sigmoid colon
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Grade 2 (minimal response) - Residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block 5)
MLH1		Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutationor somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Other findings:
- The epicenter of tumour is located less than 2cm from the dentate line.  Therefore the tumour is classified as anal adenocarcinoma.
- The twolymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma are peri-rectal (below the peritoneal reflection, block 21 and 22).
- Prostatic tissue is present at the anterior side of specimen with florid chronic inflammation.
