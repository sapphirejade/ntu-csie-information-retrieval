CLINICAL:
Endometrial Ca.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries.


MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 99g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  A 22 x 22mm polypoid tan lesion is present on the posterior surface of the endometrial cavity.  On sectioning, the endometrium is up to 3mm in thickness posteriorly with no definite myometrial invasion.  The underlying myometrium is 21mm in thickness.  The myometrium contains a single 4mm fibroid anteriorly. The right fallopian tube is 42mm x 5mm.  Three small simple cysts, 2 to 10mm, are present on the surface.  The right ovary is 22 x 10 x 12mm and has a smooth serosal surface.  The cut surface shows a single 3 x 2mm simple cyst.  The left fallopian tube is 33 x 5mm with a 7mm parafimbrial cyst, which contains gelatinous tan material.  The left ovary is 22 x 13 x 10mm with a smooth serosal surface.  The cut surface shows a 7 x 5 x 12mm cystic space at the hilum with a smooth inner lining containing gelatinous clear material.  There are no solid areas or papillary excrescences.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix (block 1 with fibroid); 4 to 7 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 8 &amp;amp; 9 - paired blocks posterior endometrium; 10 - posterior endometrium; 11 &amp;amp; 12 - right fallopian tube; 13 - two TS right ovary; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - left fallopian tube; 16 &amp;amp; 17 - four TS left ovary (entire cystic region); 18 to 29 - remainder of anterior endometrium (left to right); 30 to 39 - remainder of posterior endometrium (right to left).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Applebaum):
The endometrium is entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show multiple foci of complex hyperplasia with cytological atypia, some of which is polypoid.  There is associated tubal metaplasia in some areas.  No diagnostic adenocarcinoma is seen.  The myometrium shows several small leiomyomas.  The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.
The right and left ovaries and right and left fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus cervix bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
-  Complex hyperplasia with cytological atypia.
-  Leiomyomas.
