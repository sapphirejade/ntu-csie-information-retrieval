Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY

CLINICAL:
Upper rectal cancer attached to lateral pelvic wall.  Distal doughnut.  Left vas (attached to tumour).
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of sigmoid colon and rectum measuring 170mm in length x 45 x 40mm. The peritoneal reflection is not identified in the specimen. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  In the upper rectum, there is a circumferential tan tumour measuring 40 x 40mm which has invaded into the perirectal fat.  The tumour is 25mm from the distal surgical margin (inked blue) and is 135mm from the proximal surgical margin (inked black).  On sectioning the tumour does not involve the serosa, and is 0mm from the nearest posterior radial margin. 
Blocks:  1 - black surgical margin; 2 - blue surgical margin; 3 to 7 - tumour (block 3 - tumour normal colon; 4 & 5 - paired blocks tumour and closest radial margin and involved lymph node; 6 & 7 - tumour and ?closest radial margin); 8 & 9 - paired blocks ?closest tumour/involved lymph node to radial margin; 10 - apical lymph node; 11 & 12 - rectal lymph nodes; 13 & 14 - sigmoid lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Colon" consists of a doughnut of colon measuring 50mm in length x 33 x 15mm in diameter.  There is a stapled margin at one end.Representative sections in 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Distal doughnut" consists of two sutured bowel length measuring 22 x 21 x 10mm and 22 x 15 x 8mm.  Representative in 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - largerfragment; 2 - smaller fragment.
D.  Specimen labelled "Vas" consists of a grey tan tubular structure measuring 12 x 4 x 4mm.  There is attached fibroadipose tissue.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 1 block.  (TO: KZ; US/rt 1.8.63)

COLORECTAL PROFORMA

Site of tumour:  Upper rectum	
Maximum tumour diameter:  40mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:   25mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:     No
Forrectal tumours
Relation of tumour to anterior peritoneal reflection:	 Above 
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  9mm (posterior, A8)
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  20	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  3 (up to 4mm in size, apical node not involved) 	
pN1b	Metastases in 2-3 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (Extramural, A11) 
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Suppurative inflammation and fibrosis are seen in the perirectal fat.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
Summary - TNM 7th Edition
pT3     pN1b     pMX     R0
B. Sections show large bowel with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Acute serositis is focally present.
C. Sections show large bowel with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
D. Sections show vas deferens with no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS	
A. Anterior resection: 
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading perirectal fat, margins clear
- Metastatic carcinoma in 3 out of 20 lymph nodes
B and C. Colon and distal doughnut: no evidence of malignancy
D. Left vas: no evidence of malignancy
