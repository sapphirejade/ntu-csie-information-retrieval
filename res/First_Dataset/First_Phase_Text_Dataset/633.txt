CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Hx of wafarinuse for AF.  Rheumatoid arthritis. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes + ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 61g in total.  The uterusmeasures 80 x 55 x 44mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The soft tissue margin on uterus is inked green anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 24 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is an ill-defined tan polypoid and friable mass within the endometrial cavity 45 x 40 x 17mm.  On sectioning the myometrium is 29mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains one fibroid 26mm in maximum dimension.  The fibroid has whorled grey cut surfaces.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 9mm and have anunremarkable cut surface.  The fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 22 x 8 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 58mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix (6 and 7 are paired); 8 and 9 - sections of tumour including serosal surface of uterus (8 reserved block); 10 - right fallopian tube and ovary; 11 - left fallopian tube and ovary; 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 55 x 35 x 6and 18 x 15 x 6mm.  There is a brown solid nodule 12mm in maximum dimension loosely attached to the surface of the larger piece.  No other nodules are identified.
Blocks: 1 - nodule bisected; 2 and 3 - sections of fatty tissue.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. P Zima):
A.  Sections show a mixed serous and grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (50%/50%) of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 2mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Focal lymphvasvular invasion is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The myometrium shows a large submucosal leiomyoma.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show a focus of haemorrhagic fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Mixed serous and grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 2mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  Cervix uninvolved.  The omentum is negative.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 19/3/64:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
