The surrounding breast tissue in specimen C shows fibrocystic changes and columnar cell lesions.
The nipple appears normal. Keratin stains are in progress.

B. RIGHT BREAST: INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  7.4.62
Material sent to Dr P Zehnder, KINGSTON SOLDIERS' MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Hospital, for HER-2 CISH testing, the results of which are as follows:
HER-2 CISH result (HER-2 CISH Invitrogen SPOT-Light assay): 
HER-2 CISH result:  NEGATIVE (nonamplified, diploid:  C2, C5, C6)

HER-2 CISH result:  NEGATIVE (nonamplified, polysomy:  B1)

Mean HER-2 copy number per cell: B1 2.7, C2 1.6, C5 1.8, C6 1.9
SCORING CRITERIA (Updated in line with ASCO/CAP recommendations): 
1 -2.5 copies		Non amplified (diploid)
2.5 < 4 copies		Non amplified (polysomic)
4 to 6 copies	 	Equivocal 
>6 but <10 copies	Low level amplification
10 or more copies	High level amplified
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: 
Keratin staining was performed on all nodes in specimen D, in view of the lobular nature of the invasive tumours. These stains are negative and show no diagnostic evidence of malignancy. 
Focal artefactural staining is seen one node (D5) which is non-specific and out of thetissue plane.
E Cadherin staining on specimen B (right breast) is positive, consistent with ductal carcinoma.
E Cadherin staining on the tumours in the left breast is negative, consistent with lobular carcinomas. 
Repeat progesterone receptor staining shows moderate positivity for most tumour cells in specimen B. In specimen C, tumour 1 is very weakly PR positive. Tumour 2 appears strongly PR positive and tumour 3 shows moderate to strong positive staining of most cells.
