HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Mesothelioma, peritoneotomy.  Retroperitoneal lymph nodes (para-aortic lymph node).  Rectum/gallbladder.  Small intestine.  Omentum for histopath.  Please check Ki67.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, PELVIC MASS, RECTUM, SIGMOID, VAGINA, PERITONEUM, SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Received multiple tissue fragments including:

An enbloc resection of a mass with adherent right hemicolectomy including long segment of terminal ileum, rectosigmoid and ??part of vaginal wall (this was not definitively identified in post fixation specimen).  The identified caecum and ascending colon measures 130x90mm. The attached extended loop of small bowel adherent and coiled measuring approximately 670mm in length and up to 40mm in circumference. The adherent rectosigmoid measuring 340mm in length and up to 35mm in circumference. Anteriorly there is a segment of possible portion of vaginal wall measuring 25x20mm.
Centrally to these adherent organs there is a lobulated mass located anterior to the peritonealised segment of the rectosigmoid measuring 140x100x80mm.  It has lobulated  firm white cut surface with areas of necrosis and a superior cystic component measuring 60x40mm which is multiloculated and filled with mucinous yellow material. The solid mass extensively invades the adjacent fat and also invades rectosigmoid wall and ulcerates its mucosa.  Multiple involved lymph nodes are identified within the mesorectal and mesocolon fat.  Multiple firm white nodules are seen on the peritoneal surfaces of the small bowel, large bowel and the strips of peritoneum with extensive infiltration into the adjacent fat largest measuring 24x20x15mm and the remainder measures 2-15mm in maximum thickness.

(1 right hemicolectomy proximal resection margin; 2 right hemicolectomy distal resection margin; 3 rectosigmoid proximal resection margin; 4 rectosigmoid distal resection margin; 5 small bowel with overlying serosal  involvement; 6 mesentery of small bowel involvement; 7&amp;amp;8 mucosal involvement of large bowel [rectosigmoid]; 9 vaginal wall; 10&amp;amp;11 continuous pieces representative larger mass; 12 ? lymph node involvement; 13&amp;amp;14 RS cystic areas proximal mass; 15 serosal  involvement into the adjacent fat)

A gallbladder measuring 80x30mm. The outer surface is fatty with multiple adhesions.  The wall is up to 4mm thick.  The mucosal surface is green and granular.  No calculi are identified.
(16 cystic duct and LS fundus; 17 TS neck ; 18 one TS body)

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 230x130x70mm. Scattered firm white deposits are identified across the omentum involving the underlying fat on its cut surface. These nodules measure 3-15mm in maximal thickness.

(19-21 omental involvement)

Received multiple peritoneal strips measuring 140x70x25mm.  Multiple (up to 20) firm white nodules are identified measuring 3-10mm in maximum thickness.

(22&amp;amp;23 RS peritoneum involvement). (24-16 further tumor edge with 26 tumor block for tissue banking). RS (M-26)

B.  &amp;quot;PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES&amp;quot;.  Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring 100x65x30mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest measures 40mm with lobulated firm white cut surface extending into the adjacent fat.  The remainder lymph nodes are 3-25mm.

(1 five lymph nodes; 2 one lymph node bisected; 3 five lymph nodes; 4-14 each one lymph node serially sliced; 15 RS two TS of largest lymph node; 16 five lymph nodes). RS (M-16/ZH/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr KRISTOFER STUKOWSKI[Registrar]/Dr Q Porras)

A&amp;amp;B. Sections show confluent involvement of the visceral serosal surfaces with epithelioid malignant mesothelioma with multiple adhesion between the loops of bowel. The described dominant mass of the anterior rectosigmoid show solid sheets of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Other patterns of the tumors are identified including tubulopapillary, micropapillary and trabecular. No sarcomatiod areas are identified. The mitotic count is 3 per 10 HPF. Lymphovascular invasion is identified. Extensive areas of necrosis are seen. The diagnosis of mesothelioma is confirmed by positivity of tumor cells to CK7, CAM5.2 , D2-40, HMBE-1 , Calretinin, CK5/6 and WT1. Negative staining is seen for CK20, CEA, PAX-8, GATA-3, TTF-1 and ER. Ki67 stains 20-30% of tumor cells.
The tumour invades into the mesorectal adipose tissue and infiltrates into the adjacent bowel to reach and ulcerate the rectosigmoid mucosa. Confluent serosal involvement of similar solid and papillary tumour cells is seen on the mesentery of the small bowel, serosal surface of  the small bowel, and the omentum. Tumor also involves the separate strips of peritoneum. Tumor is not seen at the cut surface of the surgical margins of the small and large bowel. The gallbladder appears unremarkable.
The sampled lymph nodes show metastatic epithelioid mesothelioma in 26 of 30 submitted lymph nodes (2 of 2 nodes in specimen A and 24 of 28 nodes in specimen B) .

DIAGNOSIS:
A.OMENTUM, PELVIC MASS, RECTUM, SIGMOID, PERITONEUM, SMALL BOWEL  - EPITHELIOID MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA
