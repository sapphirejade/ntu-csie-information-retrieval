HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Low grade appendix tumour.  Right colon, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT COLON AND PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  A right hemicolectomy comprising of terminal ileum, caecum, ascending colon, mesocolic fat and appendix and received separately are multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum, all covered by a mucinous deposit of tumour.  The right hemi measures 230mm in length with a proximal diameter of 20mm, distal diameter of 25mm.  The terminal ileum by itself is 100mm.  The ascending colon is 130mm, caecum is up to 30mm in depth.  The caecum is covered with mucinous tumour 70x50mm partially disrupted at one edge over an area measuring 45mm in length by 10mm in maximum diameter.  There is a possible stump of appendix 10x6mm surrounded by tumour. The mesocolic fat is up to 75mm wide.  The serosal surface is covered by a mucinous deposit of tumour.  On opening the lumen, no discrete mass lesion is noted within the terminal ileum or ascending colon.

(1 proximal margin; 2 distal margin; 3 section of ascending colon with mucinous serosal deposit; 4 stump of appendix showing serosal involvement; 7-11 mucinous tumour;  12-14 RS of lymph nodes [12 four possible nodes, 13 seven possible nodes, 14 two possible nodes];

A separate piece of peritoneal tissue covered by mucinous tumour deposits, in aggregate it measures 140x100x30mm.

15&amp;amp;16 sections of separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue).  RS (M-16/MC/nh).

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr E Cacace)
Histology shows bulky serosal and peritoneal deposits of low grade mucinous neoplasm consistent with origin from the appendix.  There is a short stump of residual appendix present which shows normal mucosa.  The appendix and caecum are surrounded by dense deposits of extracellular mucin with inflammation and fibrosis and a low to intermediate cellularity population of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium.  Further bulky deposits are seen over the serosa of the small intestine and colon.  No evidence of malignancy is seen within 8 mesocolic lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of high grade frankly malignant invasive adenocarcinoma.  The mucosa of the small intestine and colon are otherwise unremarkable.  The appearances are consistent with origin from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT COLON AND PERITONEAL DISEASE -
- BULKY SEROSAL PERITONEAL DEPOSITS OF LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM
