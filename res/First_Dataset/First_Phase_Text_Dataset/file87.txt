Date performed: 1/3/2062
Episode number: 88M693738P
Procedure: BMAT
Site: R PSIC.
Peripheral Blood:
Hb: 98g/L		              	Blasts: 0.0x10e9/L
WBC:  12.71x10e9/L			Monocytes: 0.4x10e9/L
Platelets: x10e9/L			Eosinophils: 0.06x10e9/L
Neutrophils: 11.4x10e9/L		Basophils: 0.02x10e9/L
Lymphocytes: 0.9x10e9/L

Film report:
Red cells: hypochromic microcytosis with occasional polychromatic cells and elliptocytes.
White cells: occasional hypersegmented neutrophils.
Platelets: increased with large and giant forms.  2 megakaryocyte fragments are seen in the tail.
ASPIRATE
Ease/difficulty of aspiration: easy.
Aspirate report: the aspirate consists of multiple platelets clumps .  The specimen is unsuitable for formal evaluation, await trephine.

Haematology registrar: SHAYNE MARCIEL.

Cancer Council Registry: No


TREPHINE.
Length and condition of core: A 10mm specimen was collected and 5 sections examined. The specimen consists of haematopoietic tissue, bone, muscle, cartilage and clot.
Cellularity: increased for age.

Bone Architecture: Normal.
Reticulin stain: Grade 1-2+.
Trephine report: Hypercellular bone marrow with markedly increased megakaryocyteswith a tendancy to form loose clusters.  Some of the megakaryocytes are large with staghorn nuclei.
Granulopoiesis appears mildly increased and mildly left shifted.  Erythropoiesis appears normoblastic with normal morphology.
Special stains/Immunohistochemistry: Perls stain &amp;#8211; no stainable iron.

Conclusion: Hypercellular bone marrow with prominent megakaryocyte proliferation inclusing some larger forms with staghorn nuclei.  These finding are consistent with essential thrombocytosis.
