CLINICAL:
Right breast cancer 10 o'clock 7cm FN.  WLE + SLNBx.  Right breast lump - loop medial, long lateral, double deep.  
Addition:  Hookwire localised.  Sentinel nodes right axilla 1 & 2 (hot) + extra axillary node. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 1", consists of fibrofatty tissue which measures 20 x 20 x 5mm.  One lymph node is identified.  AE 1 block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 2", consists of fibrofatty tissue which measures 30 x 15 x 15mm.  One lymph node is identified.  AE 2 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Hookwire loop medial, long lateral, double deep", consists of a piece of firm breast tissue measuring 45mm (medial to lateral) x 25mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of overlying skin measuring 45 x 15mm.Three marking sutures are present as described above.  A hookwore is also present.  The superior surface is inked blue, the inferior surface is inked red and the deep surface is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medialto lateral into 7 slices with the hookwire tip ending in slice 5.  On sectioning there is a fibrous appearing mass which measures 30 x 25 x 30mm.  The mass appears to abut all margins.  Blocks 1-7 - LS of the medial margin slice 1; 8-11 - composite blocks slice 2; 12-14 - slice 3; 15-17 - slice 4; 18 & 19 - slice 5; 20-22 - slice 6; 23-28 - LS of the lateral margin slice 7.  AE and please see attached diagram for details.
D.   Specimen labelled "Additional node", consists of fibrofatty tissue which measures 20 x 15 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.   (FO/ec 17.10.63)
