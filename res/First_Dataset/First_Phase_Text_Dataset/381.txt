Ca prostate.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate" consists of a prostate 45 x 40 x 36mm and weighing 34.7g.  The right vas measures 25mm and the left vas measures 20mm in length.  The right seminal vesicle measures 18 x 10 x 10mm.  The left seminal vesicle measures 17 x 10 x 8mm.  The left half is inked blue and the right half black with anterior green.  The prostate is transversely sectioned into 4 slices.  Slice 1 (apex) and 5 (base) are further parasagitally sectioned.  Specimen all embedded.  
Blocks:  1 - 8 - slice 1 (apex) from right to left; 9 & 10 - slices 2 and 3; 11 to 23 - slice 5 (base) (with blocks 15&16, 17&18, 19&20, 21&22 - paired blocks bisected sections with posterior first); 24 - right seminal vesicle; 25 - right vas; 24 - left seminal vesicle; 25 - left vas. AE.  Please refer to attached diagram.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph nodes" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 45mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5 to 22mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph nodes. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of a piece ofunorientated fatty tissue 48mm.  One lymph node 20mm is identified.  
Blocks:  1- lymph node; 2- remainder of tissue.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Tissue at bladder neck" consists of a cream piece of tissue 6 x 5 x3mm.  BAE 1 block.  (TO:  WY:  LI/mm 21.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr B Gayne)
A-D. The prostate has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sectionsshow an acinar adenocarcinoma with the following features:
Histological type:  Acinar adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour location: 
Dominant nodule:  Right mid posterolateral prostate extending into right posterolateral base.
	Non-dominant (>10mm):  Not present.
	Smaller nodules:  Present; right mid posterior, left mid posterior, right mid 	anterior, left mid anterior, right lateral apex and central apex. 
Volume/Size:	0.6ml (17mm x 6.2mm x 13.5mm x 0.0004) 
Gleason score: 	5 + 3 =8 with tertiary pattern 4. 
Extraprostatic extension:  Present
-  Extensive - right posterolateral mid prostate; up to 1.5mm beyond prostate over a front of approximately 11mm; Gleason grade 5 (A9, A10) 
-  Focal minimal -  right posterolateral base prostate; 0.1mm beyond  prostate over front of 0.1mm; Gleason grade 5 (A11).
Surgical margins:  	0.4mm clear (intraprostatic tumour - A10).
			0.7mm clear (extraprostatic tumour - A9). 
Perineural invasion:	Present: numerous foci including extraprostatic.  
Seminal vesicles:	Not involved.
Bladder neck (Specimen C):	Not involved.
Lymph nodes (Specimens B & C):  Seven negative lymph nodes (0/7) (six right pelvic 
nodes and one left pelvic node). 
Lymphovascular invasion: 	Not seen. 
Other: Numerous acutely inflamed benign glands. Organising thrombus in a medium sized vein (A22).
Stage (AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition)
pT3a  Extracapsular extension. 
pN0    No positive regional nodes. 
MX     Cannot be assessed histologically.
DIAGNOSIS:
A-D. Prostate, right and left pelvic lymph nodes and bladder neck tissue:
- Acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 5 +3 =8 (tertiary pattern 4)
- Extensive extracapsular invasion by Gleason grade 5 carcinoma
- Seminal vesicles and bladder neck not involved
- Margins clear
- Seven negative pelvic lymph nodes (0/7)
- Stage pT3a, N0, MX.
