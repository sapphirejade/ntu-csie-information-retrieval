CLINICAL:
BRCA gene mutation.  Hysterectomy/BSO 18 months ago, left tubaladenocarcinoma in situ.  Chemotherapy.  Interval debulking 20 January 2063.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic peritoneum and L ovarian pedicle", consists of a strip of fatty and tan tissue 80mm in length.  On the peritoneum there is an area which is tan and has small papillary projections arising from it.  Serially sectioned, AE 3 blocks (3 - papillary area identified). 
B.  Specimen labelled "Smallbowel mesenteric lymph node", consists of a tan piece of tissue 5mm. AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon", consists of a shiny piece of ? peritoneum 25mm in length. There is a nodule 8mm identified at one end.  Serially sectioned, AE 1 block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum", consists of a piece of fatty tissue with peritoneum attached to one side 60 x 20 x 17mm.  Serially sectioned, AE 4 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omentum 220 x 70 x 25mm. Ill defined firm cream tissue is identified admixed with fatty tissue. Representative sections in 3 blocks. (XLc/ec 6.2.63)
