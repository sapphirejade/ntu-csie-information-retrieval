Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Sentinel node biopsy for frozen section,imprint cytology.  HTN x 3 CABG.  Post op angioplasty and fasciotomy.  Right breast - mastectomy.  Prior excision of papillary cystic carcinoma.  Stitch lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary sentinel node" received fresh, consists of red/tan lymph node plus subcutaneous tissue measuring 25 x 10 x 7mm in total.  The lymph node is 17 x 10 x 10mm.  Four imprints.  
Blocks:  1 - lymph node.  
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy.
Phone result to Dr Williams by Dr Y Reinmiller at 2.55pm on 20.01.13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch lateral" consists of a total mastectomy with one suture lateral for orientation.  It measures 480mm (medial to lateral), 140mm (superior to inferior) and 30mm superficial to deep margin.  There is an ellipse of skin with nipple and areola complex, 150 x 85mm at 6 o'clock and 5mm from the nipple there is a linear scar, 20mm in length.  The rest of the skin is unremarkable.  On sectioning there is a retroareolar cavity, 25mm (medial to lateral), 20mm (superior to inferior) and 17mm (superficial to the deep margin).  The cavity is approximately 5mm from the deep margin, more than 100mm from superior margin, more than 50mm from inferior margin and more than 25mm from superficial margin.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 - nipple; 2 most lateral cavity; 3 and 4 -  composite of full section of cavity with nipple and deep margin; 5 and 6 - composite of full section of cavity with nipple and deep margin 7 - most medial cavity  ( cavity all embedded from medial to lateral; 8 - medial tissue next  to cavity; 9 - lateral tissue next to cavity; 10 & 11 - representative upper inner quadrant; 12 & 13 - representative upper outer quadrant; 14 & 15 - representative lower inner quadrant; 16 & 17 - representative lower outer quadrant; 18 - superior tissue next to cavity; 19 -inferior tissue next to cavity; 20 and 21 - superficial-inferior margin; 22 - superficial-superior margin.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Y Gasser)
A.  The single sentinel lymph node shows reactive changes included scattered haemosiderin-laden macrophages.  There are multiple small foci of hyalinisation with dystrophic non-psammomatous calcification.  The CAM5.2 keratin immunostain is negative.  No evidence of malignancy seen. 
B.  The surgical cavity and surrounding parenchyma have been entirely embedded and examined.   A 1.1mm focus of residual high grade flat ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is seen inferior to the cavity, and is well clear (>10mm) of the closest deep margin (block B19).  There is no associated calcification or necrosis.  The epidermis including nipple shows no evidence of Paget's disease.  There is a dermosubcutaneous scar and reactive changes around the cavity include organising haemorrhage, fibrosis, fat necrosis and suture granulomas.  There is cystic change and focal columnar cell change.  Foci of vascular calcification are present.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.No invasive carcinoma seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right axillary sentinel lymph node:  
-  One (1) negative lymph node.
B.  Right completion mastectomy:
-  1.1mm focus of residual high grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), well clear (>10mm) of closest deep margin.
-  No invasive carcinoma seen.
