HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Para-aortic LN.  Rectosigmoid, R hemicolectomy.  Peritonectomy Splenectomy + tissue.  cholecystectomy.  Omentectomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, OMENTUM, ANTERIOR RESECTION, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Consists of gallbladder, spleen, omentum. A segment of large bowel with small bowel consistent with right hemi.  A segment of large bowel, umbilicus and strips of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum.

Gallbladder measures 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of 25mm.  It is received collapsed. The serosa is roughened with ? areas of adhesion.  There is a lymph node at the neck of gallbladder. The wall is up to 2mm thick. Mucosa is granular green in appearance.  No stones are found within the lumen.

(1 cystic duct, neck of gallbladder and lymph node; 2 body and fundus)

Spleen weighs 70g and it measures 95x65x20mm.  The capsule appears unremarkable.  It is partially stripped.  On sectioning the cut surface is red to brown in appearance.  No discrete tumour mass is identified.  The hilar resection area is mildly roughened.

(3&amp;amp;4 spleen)

Omentum measures 410x180x20mm.  It is partially covered by a mucinous deposit of tumour.

(5-7 omentum showing tumour [5 tumour block])

Section of umbilicus including underlying fibrofatty tissue. The umbilicus measures 30x15mm.  Underlying fibrofatty tissue is 165x45x15mm.

(8&amp;amp;9 CS showing umbilicus; 10 underlying fibrofatty tissue includes possible muscle)

Segment of bowel consistent with right hemicolectomy. The loops of small bowel are adherent to each other forming a complex mass which measures in entirety 230x110x60mm.  Proximal margin is inked blue, distal margin black.  On the serosal surface multiple areas of roughening consistent with adhesion.

(11 proximal and distal margin; 12&amp;amp;13 areas of serosal roughening on small bowel; 14 adherent loop of small bowel; 15 three possible nodes from mesentery)

Segment of large bowel.  It measures 235mm in length with a proximal diameter of 25mm and distal diameter of 25mm.  Attached mesocolic fat is up to 60mm wide. The serosa shows areas of roughening consistent with adhesion. On opening the lumen there is a patch of pouching of the wall ? secondary to pressure but the mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  Proximal margin is inked blue, distal black.

(16 proximal and distal margin; 17&amp;amp;18 areas of serosal adhesions; 19 possible node from mesocolic fat)

The separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum in aggregate measure 210x160x25mm.  Some of the pieces are covered by a mucinous deposit of tumour.

(20&amp;amp;21 sections of peritoneum involved by tumour). RS (M-21)

B.  &amp;quot;TISSUE FROM SPLENIC ARTERY&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue.  It measures 40x10x10mm.  Bisected.  AE (M-1)

C.  &amp;quot;PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of one piece of brown tissue measuring 35x15x6mm.  Quadrisected.  AE (M-2/MC/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. Y. Woodly)
A. The gallbladder shows features of chronic cholecystitis. The cystic duct lymph node shows lipogranulomatous inflammation with no malignancy.  The spleen shows no significant abnormality with retained red pulp and white pulp. The umbilicus shows subcutaneous fat necrosis and organising granulation tissue. There is also haemorrhage and scarring.

The sections of omentum show pools of mucin which are partially lined by low grade mucinous epithelium and also contain nests of low grade mucinous cells free-floating within the pools. There is surrounding organising fibrosis and granulation tissue and fat necrosis. No high grade areas are seen and there are no signet ring cells.

The right hemicolectomy resection margins are unremarkable. The serosa shows fibrous adhesions. Within the serosa of the small bowel there is also a diffuse infiltrate of signet ring cells, some of which lie within mucin pools. These also infiltrate into the muscularis propria extensively. They are also present on the serosal surface. These tumour cells extensively infiltrate into the sinuses of the three sampled lymph nodes.  Percentage of signet ring cells is in the order of 30%.

The large bowel serosa is diffusely infiltrated by this cohesive epithelioid tumour cells, some with signet ring cell morphology. These invade from the serosa into the outer layer of the muscularis propria. The resection margins are unremarkable. There are also serosal surface deposits present. Tumour cells are seen within the sinuses of 3 mesocolic lymph nodes.

The peritoneum shows pools of mucin, some of which contain nests of low grade mucinous epithelium and an occasional signet ring cell.

B. Sections show fibrofatty tissue which is infiltrated by discohesive population of carcinoma cells with  a rare signet ring cell. There is a small lymph node which is involved by poorly differentiated carcinoma.

C. Sections show fibrofatty tissue with one lymph node. There is poorly differentiated carcinoma within the fibrofatty tissue and involving the lymph node, confirmed with cytokeratin CAM5.2 immunohistochemistry.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, OMENTUM, ANTERIOR RESECTION, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- HIGH-GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI (PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI) WITH SIGNET RING CELLS
- INVOLVES THE OMENTUM, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, RECTUM, PERITONEUM
AND FOUR LYMPH NODES
B. TISSUE FROM SPLENIC ARTERY:
- POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA WITH OCCASIONAL SIGNET RING CELLS
- INVOLVES ONE LYMPH NODE
C. PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE:
- POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA INVOLVING THE LYMPH NODE AND ADJACENT FIBROFATTY TISSUE
