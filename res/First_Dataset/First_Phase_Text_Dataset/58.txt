CLINICAL:
E/O mesenteric lipomatous tumour.  Well otherwise.  E/O lipomatous tumour of small bowel mesentery ?liposarcoma.  Suture on deep mesenteric margin. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Mesenteric mass stitch deep margin", consists of a unorientated segment of small bowel measuring 140mm in length x 50mm in open diameter with attached mesocolon.  The mesocolon has a large yellow fatty mass measuring 125 x 70 x 70mm.  The mass appears encapsulated and in continuity with the mesocolon.There is a suture at one surface at the junction of the mesocolon and the mass with a suture (oriented deep margin).  The deep margin is inked black and the anterior blue.  On sectioning the bowel appears unremarkable with normal mucosal folds. The cut surface of the tumour is yellow, homogeneous and contains large slit like channels (?vessels) with haemorrhage.  Block 1 & 2- bowel surgical margins; 3 & 4- paired blocks true deep margin near suture; 5 & 6 - paired blocks bowel and closest tumour; 7-18 - representative tumour.  (TO: PP;DL/ec  10.1.63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr M Bevel)
The 125mm mesenteric mass is a benign lipoma. The lipoma is partially surrounded by a thin fibrous pseudo-capsule and consists of uniformly distributed mature adipocytes. There is no significant variation in adipocyte size or cytologic atypia. No lipoblasts are seen. The lipoma extends focally to the sutured margin. The small bowel margins are well clear. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
Mesenteric mass: Lipoma. 
Please correlate with clinical and imaging findings.
