Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Hx of large lipomatous like tumour deep to R gluteus max mm for excision.  
(R) gluteal tumour + cytogenetics.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "(R) gluteal mass short - superior, long - lateral, loop - deep" consists of a lobulated fatty tumour with a small amount of skeletal muscle attached superiorly.  The specimen was oriented in person by Dr Delfi (surgical fellow).  The specimen measures 195mm (superior to inferior) x 180mm (medial to lateral) x 77mm (superficial to deep) and weighs 1,377g.  Two pieces of tumour tissue are submitted for tissue banking from the superficial aspect.  Two exophytic nodules are present on the deep surface between which liesthe sciatic nerve bed.  Superficial inked black, deep blue, medial red, lateral orange and sciatic nerve bed green. 
The specimen is sectioned from superior to inferior into 14 slices.
The cut surfaces show homogenous fatty tissue with foci of haemorrhage.  
No areas of necrosis are identified.  The tumour appears well circumscribed and does not appear to infiltrate the attached skeletal muscle superiorly.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - superior margin (slice 1further longitudinally sectioned); 3 & 4 - inferior margin (slice 14 further longitudinally sectioned); 5 - tumour and adjacent skeletal muscle; 7 - tumour and medial margin; 8 - tumour and lateral margin; 9 - tumour and superficial margin; 10 - tumour and deep margin; 11 & 12 - tumour and sciatic nerve bed; 13 to 20 - further representative tumour.  
Please see attached diagrams (four pages).  (RC/mm 22.6.62) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by A/Prof B Mccarthey):  
Sections show a well differentiated lipomatous lesion displaying mild variability in lipocyte size and mild nuclear atypia. Overall, the fatty tissue within this lesion closely resembles mature adipose tissue. Very occasional adipocyte nuclei show features approaching lipoblasts. No evidence of dedifferentiation is identified. 
Fine bundles of collagen are present within the tumour and in many areas the tumour appears bounded by a thin fibrous capsule. No definite invasion of skeletal muscle is identified.
The lesion abuts the inkedsurface of the specimen in a number of areas, including superiorly, inferiorly, medially and along the sciatic nerve bed.
The appearances are consistent with an atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma and confirmation of this diagnosis with MDM2 testing at GIPPSLAND SOUTHERN HEALTH SERVICE - LEONGATHA CAMPUSs' hospital is in progress.
Dr B Bali has also seen this case and agrees with the above.
DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT GLUTEAL MASS: 
	ATYPICAL LIPOMATOUS TUMOUR/WELL-DIFFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOMA (SEE ABOVE)

ADDITIONAL REPORT, 6/9/62:
Sections were sent to B Tingen/Dr B Startt, SydPath, EASTERN EYRE HEALTH AND AGED CARE - COWELL CAMPUS's Hospital, for Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) testing, the results of which are as follows:
"FISH probe:
	MDM2 (12q15),D12Z3 (12 centromere) loci-specific probe set (ZytoVision).
FISH Results:
	nuc ish(D12Z3,MDM2)x2[50]
Comment:
	Interphase FISH detected no evidence of amplification of the MDM2 locus, 	relative to the 12 centromeric (control) locus.  A normal signal pattern was 	seen.
	Summary:  MDM2 amplification negative."
