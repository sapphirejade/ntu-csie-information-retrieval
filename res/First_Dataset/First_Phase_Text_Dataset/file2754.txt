ASPIRATE
Ease / difficulty of aspiration: With ease.
Cellularity of particles and trails: Variable cellularity. Overall, moderately hypercellular for age.
No. of cells counted: 500			M:E ratio: 3:2
Nucleated Differential Cell Count (%):
Blasts: &amp;lt;1
Lymphocytes: 6
Promyelocytes:  3
Plasma Cells: 6
Myelocytes/ Metamyelocytes: 17
Monocytes: 1
Neutrophils/Bands: 30
Eosinophils: 2
Erythroblasts: 35
Basophils: &amp;lt;1
Erythropoiesis:
Prominent rouleux and background staining. Normal erythropoietic activity and maturation.

Granulopoiesis:
Normal activity. Orderly maturation.

Megakaryocytes:
Plentiful in number. Normal morphology.

Other:
Plasma cells of 5-10% (average 6%). Binucleated forms present and occasional plasmablasts (nucleated forms) seen.

Iron stain: Normal iron stores (3+/6). No ring sideroblasts.

Flow cytometry: Plasma cells
CD45-/DR-/CD19-/38+/138+/cytoLambda+
Note: CD138 = 84% ++
Less than 4% of total cells have the above phenotype. Consistent with myeloma phenotype.
Aspirate Report: Moderately hypercellular marrow with normal trilineage haemopoiesis. Plasma cells of 5-10% (average 6%) with occasional plasmablastic forms. Findings are suggestive of plasma cell myeloma. Please correlate with the trephine report.

TREPHINE BIOPSY
Length and condition of core: Single core of 15mm with interstitial haemorrhage.
Cellularity: Variable cellularity. Overall, mildly hypercellular for age.
Bone architecture: Normal.
Reticulin stain:	Not increased (WHO 2008 MF Grade 0/3).
Trephine Biopsy Report: 	 hypercellular marrow, with active and normal trilineage haemopoiesis. Plasma cells are increased, of 10-15%, with occasional large forms. Findings are consistent with plasma cell myeloma (WHO ICD-0 code 9732/3).
Immunohistochemistry:
CD138 &amp;#8211; Positive cells (~ 10-15%) in interstitial position; occasional small clustering present.
Kappa &amp;#8211; Very occasional positively stained cells seen.
Lambda &amp;#8211; Uninterpretable. Frequent positive cells with marked interferences by non-cellular staining.
CONCLUSION:
Consistent with plasma cell myeloma (WHO ICD-0 code 9732/3).
