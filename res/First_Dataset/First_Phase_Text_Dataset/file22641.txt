HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Appendiceal tumour.
Peritonectomy.  Gallbladder.  Small/large intestine.  Right diaphragm.  Omentum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT COLON, SMALL INTESTINE, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE, OMENTUM&amp;quot;.  A right hemicolectomy specimen, large bowel with attached omentum, gallbladder, separate omentum and multiple separate fragments of peritoneum and diaphragm.  The hemicolectomy specimen consists of a length of small bowel measuring 125mm in length and open circumference of up to 35mm, caecum 30x50mm, ascending colon 100x80mm with attached pericolic fat up to 60mm in thickness.  The appendix is not identified.  The serosal surface is covered in a tan/brown exudate.  The mucosal surface of the right hemi is unremarkable.  The separate large bowel is 205mm in length with an open circumference of up to 110mm and attached atone end is omentum 170x150x10mm .  The mucosal surface is unremarkable.  The gallbladder measures up to 70mm in length and 25mm in diameter and has a smooth serosal surface.  The separate omentum measures 220x170x30mm.  The separate multiple peritoneal and diaphragmatic fragments that measure 240x150x30mm in total aggregate. There is patchy mucinous and tan/brown exudate on the peritoneal surface of the fragments.

(1-4 right hemicolectomy [1 margins, 2 caecum and ileocaecal valve, 3 serosal nodule, 4 attached peritoneum]; 5-7 separate large bowel [5 margins, 6 serosa, 7 omental roll]; 8&amp;amp;9 gallbladder [8 cystic duct + neck, 9 body and fundus]; 10&amp;amp;11 RS separate omentum; 12 RS diaphragm; 13 RS loose nodular tissue; 14-17 RS peritoneal disease).  RS (M-17/MY 4/1/2067 nh)

Further blocks:
(18&amp;amp;19 lymph nodes from right hemicolectomy; 20 lymph nodes from transverse colon).  (MY 8/1/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. M. Reist)
Sections show acellular dissecting mucin involving the serosa of caecum and terminal ileum, omentum - including omentum attached to the transverse colon, diaphragm, serosa of gallbladder and separately submitted peritoneal fragments and omental fragments.
The deposits of mucin are comprised of acellular mucin with associated fibroblastic and  mesothelial reaction and scattered macrophages without identifiable mucinous epithelium.  No destructive tumour invasion is seen.

Sections through the right hemicolectomy specimen including colon and terminal ileum, transverse colon and gallbladder show no mucosal lesions and no focal abnormalities in the mucosa or walls.  5 lymph nodes identitifed from the right hemicolectomy specimen and 2 lymph nodes from the transverse colon show reactive changes only.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT COLON, SMALL INTESTINE, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE, OMENTUM:-
-  DEPOSITS OF ACELLULAR ORGANISING MUCIN IN PERITONEAL CAVITY IN KEEPING WITH PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI
