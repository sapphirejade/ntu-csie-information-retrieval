Distribution:  DR Gordinier,  FILE-COPY,  FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Rt breast lobular Ca. - upper outer quadrant.  Short stitch superior, long lateral medium medial.  Sentinel lymph node from right axilla.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axilla sentinel node", consists of a blue dyed lymph node 25 x 15 x 15mm.  AE 1 block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion short superior, long lateral, medium medial", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with three sutures for orientation taken as above  It measures 45mm medial to lateral 65mm superior to inferior 20mm superficial to deep margin.  The superficial margin is inked blue, deep margin inked black, medial margin inked green and lateral margin inked red.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into nine slices.  On sectioning slices three to six there is an ill defined fibrous area measuring 20 x 30 x 10mm.  In slices four and five the fibrous area abuts the medial margin inked green.  
Specimen AE according to the attached diagram.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - Slice one (superior margin); 3 and 4 two; 5 and 6 - slice three; 7 and 8 - slice four; 9 and 10 - slice five; 11 and 12 - slice six; 13 and 14 - slice seven; 15 and 16 - slice eight; 17 and 18 - slice nine (inferior margin).
