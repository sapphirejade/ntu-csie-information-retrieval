Erythropoiesis: Mildly increased with normoblastic maturation

Granulopoiesis: Normal in numbers and left shifted with normal granulation pattern

Megakaryopoiesis: Plentiful with normal morphology
Iron Studies: Grade 3+, no ring sideroblasts
Flow Cytometry:  Mixed T and B cell population, however Kappa to Lambda ratio is 4:1, suggestive of monoclonal B cell population. 


BONE MARROW ASPIRATE CONCLUSION: Mildlyhypercellular bone marrow for age with no morphological evidence of lymphomatous involvement. However, in conjunction with flow cytometry, they may be a suggestion of bone marrow involvement. Await trephine biopsy.

TREPHINE.
Length and condition of core: A 14mm specimen was collected and 11 sections examined. The specimen consists of haematopoietic tissue, bone, muscle, cartilage and clot with areas of haemorrhage.
Cellularity: Mildly hypercellular for age.

Bone Architecture: Normal.
Reticulin stain: Normal.
Trephine report: Mildly hypercellular bone marrow for age.  A single small interstitial lymphoid aggregate is seen consisting of small mature lymphocytes.  Erythropoiesis appears mildly increased with normoblastic maturation.  Granulopoeisis is present in normal numbers with normal maturation.  Megakaryocytes are present with overall normal morphology.   

Immunohistochemistry/Other tests: Scattered CD3 and 20 positive cells with occasional small aggregates consisting of both CD3 and CD20 positive cells.
Conclusion:Hypercellular bone marrow for age with no morphological evidence of lymphomatous involvement.  
Date of report: 26/11/2063.
