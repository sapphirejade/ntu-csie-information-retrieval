MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental mass&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue measuring 65 x 45 x 20mm.  On palpation there is a firm area.  The firm are measures 40 x 30 x 20mm.  On sectioning the firm area is cream pale white.  1x for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section tissue; 2 to 4 - representative sections of firm ill-defined area.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
High grade malignant tumour. ?carcinoma.
Phone results to Dr X Silagy by Dr X Mendola at 9:54am on 30.05.2016

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left adnexal mass&amp;quot;, consists of a mass measuring 140 x 90 x 60mm.  The serosal surface appears intact with multiple irregular nodular surface.  The cut surface shows cystic and solid area.  The cysts areas are filled with clear to yellowish fluid. There is also area of calcification. Two pieces submitted for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section tissue; 2 to 15 representative sections of tumour (block 15 and 9 placed in decal).

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
High grade serous carcinoma consistent with ovarian.
Phone results to Dr AUBREY STROTZ by Dr X Knake at 10:45am on 30.05.2016.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue measuring 130 x 180 x 30mm.  The cuts surface shows a single foci of a tumour deposit measuring 10mm across.  The rest of the tissue is uniformly fatty
Blocks: RS block 1- 3 ( 1 - tumour deposit and 2 &amp;amp; 3 - uninvolved tissue)

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left pelvic side wall&amp;quot;, consists of a tan brown tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 8mm.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - AE.  (LM/vo 7.3.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Winther):
A to D.  Sections show diffuse infiltrate of large atypical lymphocytes involving all the specimen including omentum, left adnexal mass and left pelvic side wall.  The atypical lymphocytes have large nuclei with pale cytoplasm.  The nuclei are round, indented or irregularly folded.  The nucleoli are small, multiple and membrane bounded.  There are frequent mitoses.  The tumour cells are positive for CD10, CD20, CD45, CD79a, Bcl-6, p53 and Bcl-2.  CD3 and CD5 highlight scattered reactive T cells in the background.  The stains for Cyclin D1, MNF-116, ER, PAX8, CK7, CK20, WT-1, S100, Vimentin, SMA and Desmin are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is more than 70%.  The appearances are those of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  There is no evidence of serous carcinoma.


DIAGNOSIS:
A to D.  Omentum, adnexal mass and left pelvic side wall - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
