CLINICAL NOTES:
Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland CA slides reviewed by Dr. Marjoniemi.

1. Right sentinel groin node.
2. Right Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland suture 12 o&amp;apos;clock.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;RIGHT BARTHOLIN&amp;apos;S GLAND SUTURE AT 12 O&amp;apos;CLOCK&amp;quot;. An excision of mucosal tissue 41x20mm with a suture at one aspect indicating 12 o&amp;apos;clock. There is underlying tissue 24mm deep. Three o&amp;apos;clock inked blue, nine o&amp;apos;clock inked black. Tissue is serially sectioned from 6 o&amp;apos;clock into five slices. On the cut surface, the underlying tissue is pale and fibrous over an area of 25x17x29mm. This is area is poorly defined and abuts the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin.

(1&amp;amp;2  longitudinal section slice 1 [12 o&amp;apos;clock]; 3&amp;amp;4  slice 2; 5&amp;amp;6  slice 3; 7&amp;amp;8  slice 4; 9&amp;amp;10  longitudinal section slice 5 [6 o&amp;apos;clock]). Representative sections. (M-10) (Image available and diagram drawn).

B. &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL GROIN NODE&amp;quot;. A piece of fatty tissue 35x20x14mm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified. One lymph node 10mm across is present with a green tinge in part of the cut surface.

(1  green tinged lymph node; 2  one lymph node; 3  one lymph node bisected; 4  one lymph node). All embedded. (M-4/AO 18/6/2071 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr B Strelow)
A. The sections show squamous mucosa with underlying connective tissues including Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland. Fibroblastic reaction and suture material foreign body giant cell reaction is present and is consistent with previous surgery effect. Involving the Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland there is a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with basaloid areas and with areas showing cytoplasmic keratinisation. There is a high mitotic rate in many areas (up to 50 mitoses per 10 high power fields). Negative for lymphovascular invasion and negative for perineural invasion.
Tumour is present in three adjacent slices and therefore measures approximately 12mm in greatest dimension. The carcinoma invades to a depth of 7mm below the squamous mucosal surface. Carcinoma is 10mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, is 5mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin, is  greater than 10mm from the 12 o&amp;apos;clock margin, is greater than 8mm from the 6 o&amp;apos;clock margin and is 12mm from the deep margin.
Immunohistochemistry (Block A6): There is positive staining for CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, CK5/6,  p-63 and p16. Synaptophysin and Chromogranin are negative.
B. Four lymph nodes are identified and show reactive changes only. AE1/AE3 shows focal non-specific staining only.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT BARTHOLIN&amp;apos;S GLAND:
-  SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
B. RIGHT SENTINEL GROIN NODE:
-  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY
