CLINICAL:
Right testicular mass.  32yr old man with background of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right testicle" consists of a right testicle and spermatic cord weighing 68.8g.The testicle measures 60 x 45 x 45mm and the cord measures 65mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum diameter.  The tunica albuginea and vaginalis are intact and cover the testis.  On sectioning there is a tan haemorrhagic tumour which almost completely replaces the testis.  There are focal areas of necrosis.  The tumour appears to be encapsulated by the tunica.  The tumour measures 40 x 33 x 25mm.  There is a thin ellipse of normal testes which overlies the tumour anteriorly.  The tumour abuts the tunica, epididymis and the thin margin of normal testis.  
Blocks: 1- proximal spermatic cord margin; 2 - mid cord; 3 to 6 - full face through tumour and surrounding structures; 3 - closest tunica margin; 4 - tumour; 5 - tumour and epididymis; 6 - and normal testis; 7 & 8 - tumour; 9 - tumour reserve block. 
(AZ/ta 15/10/63)   
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Liesmann & Dr H Hottes):
Sections show a primary germ cell tumour of the testis, pure embryonal carcinoma type, replacing the majority of the testis.  The CD30 stain is diffusely positive throughout the tumour.The features are as follows:
 
Histologic type:  Pure embryonal carcinoma
	
Scarring:  Absent 
Syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells:  Absent
Maximum tumour size (maximum dimension):  40mm
Extent of tumour:
Rete testis invasion:  Absent
Epididymis invasion:  Absent 
Tunica albuginea invasion:  Absent 
Tunica vaginalis invasion:  Absent
Spermatic cord invasion:  Present (within pampiniform plexus adjacent to testis), spermatic cord margin negative
Scrotal wall invasion:  Absent
Lymphovascular invasion:  Present (within pampiniform plexus)
Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN):  Absent 
Lymph node status:  No lymph nodes received
Other comment:
The tumour differs greatly in morphology to that seen in the previous left neck lymph node core biopsy (26Z1340) which showed metastaticpoorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
Right orchidectomy:
- 40mm pure embryonal carcinoma, margins clear
- No invasion of rete testis or epididymus
- Tunica albuginea and vaginalis intact
- Lymphovascular invasion of the pampiniform plexus.
