Collected: 23/04/2012 at 15:16
Location:  ACUTE CARE WARD-HUGHENDEN HOSPITAL
DR BERNARDO DICK ROSICH
Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Breast cancer (right).  Sentinel node for frozen section.  Hx of palpable R breast ca for R mastectomy and SNBx.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axillarysentinel node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm in diameter with two nodes 6 and 10mm.  Smaller node too small to imprint.  Imprints of the larger node taken. Block 1 - larger lymph node; 2 - smaller lymph node.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:  
No malignant cells seen. 
Reported by Dr W Edelen to Dr W Trotz at 4:25pm on 23/4/12.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast", consists of a mastectomy 220mm (medial to lateral) x 150mm (inferior to superior) x 40mm (superficial to deep). There is an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 200mm (medial to lateral) x 75mm (inferior to superior). The superficial margin is inked green and the deep margin is inked black.  A firm cream stellate tumour is identified which is located in the 2 o'clock position 50mm from the nipple. The tumour measures 15mm (medial to lateral) x 17mm (inferior to superior) x 8mm (superficial to deep). The lesion is 22m from the nearest deep margin. Several ? lymph nodes are identified in the outer upper quadrant up to 15mm inmaximum dimension.  
Block 1-4 - full face of tumour from superficial to deep; 5 & 6 - further sections of tumour to deep margin; 7 & 8 -upper inner quadrant; 9 & 10 - inner lower quadrant; 
11 & 12 - outer upper quadrant; 13-15 - ?lymph nodes; 16 - nipple and tissue deep to nipple; 17 - section of tumour taken for tumour bank.  Please refer to attached diagram.   (QA/ec 26.6.62)

ADDITIONAL REPORT (7/3/62)
Repeat HER2 staining:  1+
HER2 CISH to follow in another additional report.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 2 (7/5/62)
Material was sent to Dr W Branstrom, THE CANBERRA HOSPITAL Hospital, for HER-2 CISH testing, the results of which are as follows:
Her-2 in-situ hybridisation: (Her-2 CISH Invitrogen SPOT-Light assay, blockB1)  
HER-2 CISH result: NEGATIVE (non-amplified, diploid).

Mean HER-2 copy number per cell:  2.15
Scoring Criteria (ASCO/CAP recommendations):  
Non amplified (diploid) 1-2.5 copies.  Non amplified (polysomic) = 2.5 < 4 copies.  Equivocal = 4-6 copies.  Low level amplification = >6 but <10 copies.  High level amplified = 10 or more copies.
