CLINICAL:
Hx of (L) breast mass + palpable axillary node + bx confirmed invasive ductal Ca for mastectomy + axillary dissection.  Specimen received fresh.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled"Left breast + axillary tissue" consists of a total mastectomy with axillary tail attached it measures 200mm (medial to lateral), 140mm (superior to inferior) and 30mm (skin to the deep margin).  It has an ellipse of skin measuring170mm (medial to lateral), 120mm (superior to inferior).  The axillary tail measures 110 x 70 x 20mm.  The skin surface is unremarkable.  The nipple and areola complex are present and unremarkable.  The specimen is inked blue superficialmargin, black deep margin.  On sectioning in the lower inner quadrant, at 8 o'clock, approximately 7mm from the nipple and 35mm deep to it,  there is an ill defined gritty lesion measuring 25mm (medial to lateral) 20mm (superior to inferior), 20mm (superficial to deep margin). The tumour is 10mm clear of the closest, deep margin. The other margins are well clear.  In the upper outer quadrant there is a calcified nodule measuring 10 x 5 x 5mm it is located 57 mm from the nipple.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrous appearance.
In the axillary tail there is a firm grey lymph node 30 x 30 x 20mm.  On sectioning it appears to be invaded by tumour.  Apart from the larger nodule eleven more nodules are identified measuring from 5 to 10mm.  
Blocks:  1 - nipple and areola; 2 - tumour with deep margin; 3 to 6 - four representative sections of the tumour; 7 & 8 - two representative sections of the calcified nodule in upper outer quadrant; 9 - one representative section from upper inner quadrant; 10 - one representative section from upper outer quadrant; 11 - one representative section for upper lower quadrant; 12 - one representative section of the biggest nodule; 13 - two lymphnodes; 14 - two lymph nodes; 15 - two lymph nodes; 16 - two lymph nodes; 17 - three lymph nodes.  
Further blocks: 18- tumour with superficial and deep margin; 19-20 composite ofnipple; 21-22 composite of nipple.
B. Specimen labelled "Lateral axillary mass" consists of an unorientated fibrofatty piece of tissue measuring 50 x 40 x 30mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  On sectioning there isa multilobulated white solid mass measuring 40 x 20 x 30mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - two transverse sections of the tumour with resection margin; 3 & 4 - two representative sections of the tumour with lateral margins.
C.  Specimen labelled "Intrapectoral node left side" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 20 x 3mm.  No lymph nodes are identified.  AE 2 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Bastianelli): 
A. B. C. Sections show a 25mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma with areas of apocrine, papillary and micropapillary differentiation. The carcinoma invades a sclerosed fibroadenoma, measuring at least 7mm in maximum dimension.  High grade ductal carcinoma in situ is seen both within the tumour and as separate foci in subareolar ducts.  No Paget's disease is seen. A total of nine (9) of fifteen (15) axillary lymph nodes (specimens A & B) contain metastatic carcinoma.  The lateral axillary mass (specimenB) is a lymph node almost completely replaced by metastatic carcinoma with focal extranodal extension 0.5mm from the resection margin (Block B2).  Specimen C "intrapectoral lymph node" comprises fibrofatty tissue only.  The calcified nodule in the upper outer quadrant is a sclerosed heavily calcified fibroadenoma.
A synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows: 
Invasive carcinoma:
Site:  Lower inner quadrant, 7mm FN, 35mm deep to nipple.
Type:  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma with areas of apocrine, papillary and micropapillary-like features. 
Invasive tumour size:  25mm (macroscopic).
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson):  3.
Tubules:  3    Nuclei:   3   Mitoses:  2    Mitotic rate:  10/10hpf.
Total score:  8.
Lymphovascular invasion:   Present, extensive.  Outlying foci of lymphovascular invasion are also seen beyond the advancing edge of tumour in the lower inner quadrant (Block A10).
	    
DCIS component:
Thereis high grade ductal carcinoma (DCIS) in situ within the confines of thetumour (Block A5).  Solid, high grade DCIS is also seen in large subareolar ducts, at least 15mm from the advancing edgeof the tumour with intervening uninvolved ducts.   This focus comprises two expanded ducts over an area of 8mm with Pagetoid involvement of intervening ducts.  No Paget's disease of the nipple is seen.
DCIS:   Present.  
Maximum extent of DCIS:  4mm (within tumour) and separate subareolar focus 8mm. 
Nuclear grade:  High.  
Architecture:Solid, micropapillary and cribriform. 
Necrosis:   Absent. 
Calcification: Absent. 
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:  Deep margin: 4.4mm clear (Block A19).
Superficial margin 10mm clear (BlockA19).
Other margins well clear (> 10mm). 
In-situ component:  Well clear (> 10mm).
Receptors (Block A5): 
ER:  Positive.
	95% of nuclei stained
	Predominant intensity of staining:  Strong. 
PR:   Positive.
	Approximately 20% of nuclei stained
	Predominant intensity of staining: Moderate.

Her2 staining is heterogeneous with approximately 50% showing 3+ staining and 50% of the tumour 2+ staining with an overall result of 3+.
Ki-67 index: The proliferation index is heterogeneous with up to 15% in the most proliferative areas. 
Nipple:  There is high grade DCIS in the subareolar ducts but no evidence of Paget's disease.
LCIS / ALH:  Not seen.  
Miscellaneous:  A benign intraduct papilloma is seen in the subareolar tissue. 
A biopsy tract is seen (Blocks A3 and A5), comprising organising fat necrosis and haemorrhage.A sclerosed fibroadenoma, measuring at least 7mm in dimension is invaded by ductal carcinoma (Block A5). 
The sclerosed calcified 10mm nodule in the upper outer quadrant is a sclerosed and heavily calcified fibroadenoma which is wellclear of the margins.  
Sentinel lymph node(s):

Axillary/other nodes:
Number of axillary lymph nodes examined: 15 (specimens A (x14), B (x1) & C (x0)). 
Number of axillary lymph nodes involved by tumour:  Nine (9) (x8 in specimen A & x1 in specimen B)      
Number of axillary nodes with metastases >2.0mm:  Nine (9).  
Extranodal spread:  Present
Two (2) involved lymph nodes show foci of extranodal extension by carcinoma.
One (1) lymph node is in the axillary tail, (specimen A) - 2.2mm in depth over a front of 2.2mm (Blocks A15).  The second lymph node with extranodal extension is the "lateral axillary mass", (specimen B) - with several foci measuring up to 5mm in depth over a front of 11mm, 0.5mm from the resection margin (block B2).   
Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined: Fifteen (15).
Total number of involved lymph nodes: Nine (9).
SUMMARY:

Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, 25mm diameter - 8 o'clock 7mm FN.
Margins clear (closest deep 4.4 mm).
ER, PR, HER2 Positive.
Lymph node status:  Nine of fifteen (9/15) axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma.  
Two (2) lymph nodes with extranodal extension - x1 0.5mm from resection margin (specimen B).
