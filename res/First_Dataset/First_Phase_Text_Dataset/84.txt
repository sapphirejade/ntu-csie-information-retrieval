CLINICAL:
H/x ovarian Cancer.  Omentum.  Left paracolicgutter.  Appendix.  Right paracolic gutter.  Left iliac fossa nodule.  Left iliac fossa peritoneum.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omentum measuring 240 x 120 x 30mm.  Approximately 50% of the omentum appears thickened with a firm cream nodular cut surface probably representing tumour.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists of an appendix measuring 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  There is attached periappendiceal fat measuring 50mm in length to a maximum diameter of 12mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The lumen contains clear mucoid material.  
Blocks: 1 - two LS of the proximal one third; 2 - TS middle one third; 3 - two LS distal one third appendix AE.
C.  Specimen labelled "left pericolic gutter", consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 7mm.  A nodule is present on one surface which measures 6 x 5 x 3mm.  On sectioning the nodule is a uniloculated cyst filled with yellow gelatinous material.  Serially sectioned and AE. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right pericolic gutter", consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 25 x 15 x 7mm.  A cream nodule is present measuring 20 x 7 x 5mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left iliac fossa nodule", consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 20 x 7mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left iliac fossa peritoneum", consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 35 x 5mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 4 blocks. 
(TO: HP;UZ/vo 21.2.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. Y Bakst):
A.  Sections show a low grade serous carcinoma extensively involving the omentum.
B & C.  Sections show non-invasive implants involving the appendiceal serosa and the peritoneum.  The appendix also shows some hyperplasia and a mild mucocele.
E & F.  Sections show non-invasive and invasive implants.
D.  Sections show invasive implants.
DIAGNOSIS:
Low grade serous carcinoma involving the omentum, together with non-invasive and invasive implants.
