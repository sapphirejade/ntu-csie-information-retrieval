Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrial cancer.  Hysteroscopy 4.3.66.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries&amp;#8221; consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 69g in total.
The uterus was received opened and small fragments of endometrial tumour and normal endometrium were taken for a research study on receipt.
The uterus measures 65 x 35 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.
The ectocervix measures 20 x 20 mm and has an unremarkable surface. On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.
Arising from the anterior endometrium at the fundus, 50mm from the cervical os, is a pale polypoid tumor measuring 20 x 15 x 3mm. The tumor appears to invade into the inner half of the myometrium only.  A smaller deposit of tumor is on the posterior surface, measuring 6 x 5 x 3mm.
The myometrium contains multiple fibroids ranging from 3 to 30 mm in maximum diameter.
The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.
The right ovary measures 23 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.
The left ovary measures 24 x 20 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - posterior wall tumour; 7 to 9 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 10 - anterior wall tumor; 11 to 16 - anterior wall tumour ; 17 &amp;amp; 18- RS anterior wall fibroid; 19 - right fallopian tube fimbrial end, RS fallopian tube, RS right ovary; 20 - left fallopian tube fimbrial end, RS fallopian tube, RS left ovary. Comment - All of the tumor is embedded.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right labial biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of a single piece of tan tissue measuring 5 x 4 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: MS; MS/rt 6.7.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Cheu and registrar Dr U Baughn):
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.
Sections of the endometrial tumour show a FIGO Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from the anterior and posterior endometrium at the fundus.  There is no definite myometrial invasion.  There is no lymphovascular invasion and no cervical involvement.
There are multiple benign leiomyomas present within the anterior and posterior myometrium.  There is also adenomyosis in the myometrium.
The endometrium away from the tumour is inactive and shows chronic endometritis.
Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

B. Sections show stratified squamous epithelium with underlying tissue.  The epithelium shows orthokeratosis.  There is a very mild infiltrate of scattered lymphocytes in the underlying tissue, with focal extension into the epithelium.  The appearances are non-specific but possibly represent early/mild lichen sclerosus.  There is no dysplasia.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:
1.  FIGO Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, Stage 1A.
2.  Chronic endometritis.
3.  Leiomyomas and adenomyosis.

B.  Right labial biopsy:  See text.
