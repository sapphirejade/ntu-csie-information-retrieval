Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Malignant ascites.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  ?Ov. Ca.  TAH + debulk.  Frozen section (R) tube and ovary indicated carcinoma - undifferentiated.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovary and tubeFS" consists of an ovary, 80 x 60 x 48mm with attached fallopian tube 75mm long and 6mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth.  On sectioning the ovary has a multiloculated cut surface filled with clear fluid.  There are solid areas comprising <10% of the ovary.  No papillary excrescences are seen.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 to 7 - representative sections of the ovary; 8 - representative section, reserved block for tumour bank; 9 - representative sections of the fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma with chemotherapy effect - consistent with primary ovarian carcinoma.  
Phone result to Dr L Mumma by Dr L Bellany/L Keiper at 9.30 on 01.08.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary + uterus" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and left ovary, weighing 210g in total.  The uterus measures 105 x 80 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 28 x 22mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium appears atrophic and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum dimension.  There are scattered gritty areas of throughout the myometrium (?calcification).  The left fallopian tube measures 95mm in length and up to 6mm in maximum diameter.  The fimbriated end of the fallopian tube is not identified.  The left ovary is 100 x 70 x 65mm.  The serosal surface of the ovary is smooth except for a 10 x 7mm area where serosa is disrupted (?surgical).  The disrupted serosal area is inked blue.  The ovary has a solid/cystic heterogenous cut surface with solid components comprising two-thirds of the ovary.  The solid areas are yellow/tan in colour.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - sections showing the disrupted serosal surface of the ovary; 9 to 16 - representative sections of the ovary; 17 - representative TS from the fallopian tube.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental tissue, 430 x 50 x 25mm.  There is an indurated nodule with a pale cut surface, 30 x 28 x 20mm.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative sections of the nodule.  (WM/mm 4.10.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr L Ingebretsen):
A.  Sections of the right ovary show extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  
B.  Sections of the left ovary show extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  Serous carcinoma is also present on the serosal surface of the uterus within the disrupted area described macroscopically. The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality. The endometrium is atrophic. The myometrium shows extensive calcification of blood vessel walls.  Scattered adhesions are present on the serosal surface.  The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality. 
C.   Sections of the omentum show extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - C.  Right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, uterus and cervix, omentum:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, serosa of uterus and omentum.
