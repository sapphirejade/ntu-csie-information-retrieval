CLINICAL:
Vulvar cancer - previous local excision, involved margins.  Please note diagram on request form. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva", consists of a piece of vulva with subcutaneous tissue 125 x 50 x 20mm.There are two sutures marking left anterior and posterior as per the diagram.  The margin is inked in two colours: anterior half blue and posterior half black.  There is an irregularly shaped ulcerated area onthe skin surface 62 x 20mm.  This ulcerated area abuts the anterior margin and is 50mm from left, 11mm from posterior and 10mm from the right margins. Deep to the ulcerated area there is a poorly demarcated pale indurated area extending to the deep margin. After sampling the left margin, the remainder of the specimen is serially sliced and slices are numbered from left to right. Away from the ulcerated area and 25mm from the left corner of the skin there is a calcified nodule superficially, 8mm in maximum dimension (blocks 4 & 6). 
Blocks 1 & 2- paired sections left margin; 3 & 4- slice 1; 5 & 6 - slice 2; 7 & 8 - slice 3; 9 & 10 - slice 4; 11 & 12 - slice 5; 13 & 14 - slice 6; 15 & 16 0 slice 7; 17 & 18 - slice 8; 19 & 20 - slice 9; 21 & 22 - slice 10; 23 & 24 - slice 11; 25 - slice 12; 26 & 27 - slice 13; 28- slice 14; 29 - slice 15; 30 - slice 16; 31-33 - slice 17 (right margin).  Pleasesee diagrams (2 pages).  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral inguinal node", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue 60 x 35 x 10mm in aggregate.  There are several lymph nodes.  
Block 1 - three lymph nodes; 2- one bisected lymph node; 3 - one trisected lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal node", consists of several pieces of fibrofatty tissue 70 x 45 x 25mm.  There are several lymph nodes.
Block 1- up to five lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one bisected lymph node.
D.   Specimen labelled "Left femoral lymph node", consists of two fragments of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 30 x 8mm in aggregate.  
Block 1- one likely lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node.  (to be completed).

B.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
No residual squamous cell carcinoma or VIN.  Fourteen (14) negative nodes.
