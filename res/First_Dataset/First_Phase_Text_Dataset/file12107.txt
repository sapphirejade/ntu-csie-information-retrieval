Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Distal sigmoid tumour.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Anterior resection&amp;quot;, consists of a length of bowel measuring 220mm in length with a diameter of 62mm.  Attached is a triangle of fat measuring 140 x 90 x 22mm.  10mm from the distal margin and 110mm from the proximal margin is a fungating tumour measuring 40 x 35mm with a height of 11mm.  The tumour is tan brown in appearance and has a polypoidal appearance. on sectioning the tumour does not appear to invade past the muscularis propria.
Blocks: 1 - distal margin and tumour; 2 - proximal margin; 3 to 15 - tumour, all the tumour is embedded; 16 - apical lymph node; 18 to 20 - ? lymph nodes; 22 to 27 -  ?lymph nodes.  (TO: MS;MS/vo 27.7.66); 28 to 40 - representative sections fat.  (TO: MS; MS/rt 29.7.66)

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Donut ring&amp;quot;, consists of a donut of bowel with staples measuring 17 x 15 x 10mm.  The staples removed and specimen AE.  Serially sectioned TS in 1 block.
(TO: MS;MS/vo 27.7.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Kerwin):
A and B.

Site of tumour:  Distal sigmoid
Maximum tumour diameter:   40mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:   22mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:    No

Type
Mucinous carcinoma

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:	19
Number of lymph nodes involved:	0

pN0	No regional LN metastasis

Lymphovascular invasion
Absent

Perineural invasion
Absent

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
- The lesion is arising from a polyp with mixed features of a serrated adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma.
- The donut (specimen B) shows no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
