HISTORY:
Colon cancer with peritoneal mets.  Peritonectomy + liver resection.
1. Diaphragm. 2. Gallbladder. 3. Omentum. 4. Small bowel. 5. Rectum. 6. Uterus and ovaries. 7. Para-aortic lymph node. 8. Segment 5 #1 and 2.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, SIGMOID, RECTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES; OVARIES, UMBILICUS, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received in multiple fragments.  All appears to be involved by extensive metastatic deposits on the serosal surface.
The first specimen is enbloc resection of rectosigmoid with uterus and attached peritoneum. The rectosigmoid segment of large bowel measures 105mm in length and up to 70mm in circumference.  Part of the specimen (the last 40mm is below the anterior peritoneal reflection and a line ofanastomosis is identified 30mm from the distal margin).  Mesocolon and mesorectum is attached to a maximum width of 30mm.  The mucosal surface is congested and dusky in colour inthe proximal 80mm of the colon but no definite tumours or polyps are identified.  The mucosa becomes slightly oedematous around the area of anastomosis.  The posterior mesorectum is inked black.  Attached anteriorly a uterus measuring 65x40x24mm with attached cervix 25x25x20mm. The external os is slit like measuring 7x3mm.  The identified endometrium is up to 3mm thick. The myometrium is up to 14mm thick.  Attached is a right fallopian tube 60x6mm. A right ovary 30x25x20mm, left fallopian tube 60x6mm and left ovary 27x24x20mm.  An intrauterine contraceptive device IUCD is identified within the endometrial cavity. A piece of peritoneum with attached fat is attached to the right side of the uterus 150x135x25mm and a similar piece of peritoneum with attached fat on the left side measuring 260x55x15mm (50-100 firm white nodules are extensively involving the mesentery of the large bowel), left and right peritoneal folds, the serosal surface of the uterus anteriorly and is invading into the myometrium to a depth of 20mm.  There are nodules identified on the left and right ovary.
(1-5 uterus [1 anterior cervix; 2 anterior isthmus with area of invasion intomyometrium; 3 fundus; 4 posterior body; 5 posterior cervix]; 6&amp;amp;7 right tube with fimbrial end; 8&amp;amp;9 right ovary; 10&amp;amp;11 left tube with fimbrial end; 12&amp;amp;13 left ovary; 14 right peritoneum; 15 left peritoneum; 16 on wards large bowel [16 proximal margin, 17 distal margin with distal end of the anastomosis inked red, 18 LS proximal end of anastomosis, 19 dusky area proximal bowel, 20 mesentery involvement; 21&amp;amp;22 each four lymph nodes].
A segment of small bowel 350mm in length and up to 25mm in diameter with mesentery along its length to a maximum width of 40mm. The serosa and the mesentery contains multiple (up to 20 separate nodules) with firm white cut surface. The mucosa is unremarkable with no polyps or tumour identified. (23 LS of each resection margin; 24 representative mesenteric nodule)
Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 280x140x40mm with extensive involvement of nodules, largest measuring 30mm in maximum diameter.  Total number of nodules between 50 and 100 and they all have a firm white cut surface.  (25&amp;amp;26 representative of omental nodules)
Received a piece of thick fibrous diaphragm with attached fat covered by peritoneum measuring 230x60x10mm.  It is bearing a large nodule at one end measuring  60x40x25mm that has a firm white cut surface. The specimen is extensively involved by up to 100 small white nodules with firm cut surface. (27 representative TS of the largest nodule; 28 extensive involvement of smaller nodules)
Received a piece of peritoneum attached to a firm white mass. The peritoneum measures 100x100x25mm and the mass measures 35mm in maximum diameter.
(29 TS across the mass)
Received also multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring 150x90x25mm in aggregate.  One of which has a stitch in it (? Umbilicus). The fragment contains a possible lymphnode 19mm that is involved by possible metastatic deposit.  Multiple serosal nodules are seen on the other fragments.  (30 TS representative of lymph node; 31 two TS ? umbilicus).  RS (M-30)
B.  &amp;quot;LIVER SEGMENT 5 (1)&amp;quot;.  A liver resection sample of a total weight of 7g includes a capsule surface marked with a stitch measuring 27x18mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 20mm. The margins are inked blue.  The specimen is serially sliced.  The cut surface reveals a well demarcated firm hard white lesion with central areas of ulceration measuring 14x12x8mm.  It appears to be within 5mm of the capsular surface but abutting the resection margin macroscopically. (1 TS normal liver away from lesion;2&amp;amp;3 each one TS lesion; 4 three LS lesion abutting the margin).  RS (M-4)
C.  &amp;quot;LIVER SEGMENT 5 (2)&amp;quot;.  A segment of liver of a total weight of 12g including a capsular surface marked with a stitch measuring 40x30mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 23mm.  The capsular surface is ragged and nodular. The margins are inked blue.  The specimen is serially sliced into 8 slices. The cut surface reveals nodular cut surface of a pale/yellow liver with no definite lesions.  Possible areas of central scarring are identified.  Every other slice has been embedded. (1 two LS peripheral edge; 2 TS; 3&amp;amp;4 continuous one TS; 5&amp;amp;6 continuous one TS; 7 two LS other peripheral edge).  RS (M-7)
D.  &amp;quot;PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  Unorientated fibrofatty piece of tissue 60x40x15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, largest measures 32mm in maximum diameter.  (1 five lymph nodes; 2 five lymph nodes; 3 one lymph node five TS; 4 one lymph node trisected; 5&amp;amp;6 largest lymph node in two blocks; 7&amp;amp;8 second largest lymph node 30mm in two blocks; 9&amp;amp;10 each three lymph nodes).  RS (M-10)
MICROSCOPIC:
A. Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (high grade) involves myometrium of uterus, right ovary and attached adjacent fibrous tissue and adherent bowel wall, left fallopian tube, left ovary surface and adjacent fibrous tissue, left and right parametrial tissue, colon subserosal tissue, colon muscularis propria, mesenteric nodules of small bowel, skeletal muscle of abdominal wall, omentum, peritoneum and fat adjacent to an obliterated umbilical vein structure. Sampled mesocolic lymph nodes are not involved (0/7) but there are numerous discontinuous extramural tumour deposits in mesocolic fat and metastases to mesocolic peritoneum. Lymphovascular invasion is present in several sections.
Other:
Endocervical and ectocervicalmucosa is normal. The endometrium is inactive.
B. LIVER SEGMENT 5 (1):
The excision biopsy shows liver with a deposit of metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. The deposit of adenocarcinoma extends one radial edge excisionmargin in one section focally.

C. LIVER SEGMENT 5 (2):
Sections show nodular and fibrotic liver tissue which appears to be localised nodular lesion. The features favour focal nodular hyperplasia. The lesion abuts margins focally. There is very little adjacent tissue and backround liver architecture is not readily assessable. Clinical correlation recommended.
D.  PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE:
Lymph nodes examined: 20
Number involved:0
DIAGNOSIS:
A. OMENTUM, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, SIGMOID, RECTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES; OVARIES, UMBILICUS, PERITONEAL DISEASE: Multiple deposits of metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, high grade (moderate to poorly differentiated), with extensive involvment of intraabdominal/intraperitoneal organs resected, listed above. See microscopic report. Lymphovascular invasion present.
B. LIVER SEGMENT 5 (1):  Metastatic adenocarcinoma.
C. LIVER SEGMENT 5 (2): Focal nodular hyperplasia.
D.  PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE: Lymph nodes negative for tumour.
