DR DEWAYNE KOELBEL
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Bilateral ovarian masses.  Increased Ca125.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary" consists of a 60 x 55 x 45mm ovary and attached fallopian tube 65mm in length and 8mm in diameter.  The ovary has a smooth serosal surface.  The cut surface is solid.  One section for frozen section. 
Blocks: 1 - the frozen section; 2 to 8 - representative sections of the ovary; 9 - representative sections fallopian tube; 10 - representative sections of theovary, reserve block for tumour bank.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous papillary carcinoma.
Results to Dr Germond via anaesthetist by Dr Gaut/Miler at 3.30pm on 1/8/12. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + left tube" consists of uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and a left adnexal mass weighing 160g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 70 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny surface.  The ectocervix measures 44 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 5mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 22mm in maximum thickness.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and up to 10mm in maximum diameter.  There is a left adnexal mass 60 x 30 x 30mm in continuity with the distal end of the fallopian tube.  The mass is covered by smooth serosa and has a solid yellow/friable cut surface.  The myometriumcontains two fibroids ranging from 6 to 15mm in maximum diameter (the larger one is sub-serosal).  The fimbriated end of the left fallopian tube is not identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 6 to 9 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 10 - LS of the distal end of the left fallopian tube in continuity with the adnexal mass; 11 to 13 - representative sections from the left adnexal mass; 14 - two TS of the left fallopian tube.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary" consists of a 82 x 70 x 60mm ovary.  The serosal surface is smooth.  The ovary has a solid lobulated tan/yellow cut surface.  Focally there is a cystic area 35mm in maximum dimension.  One of the cysts is roughened.  
Blocks: 1 - representative from the cystic area; 2 to 8 - representative sections.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental tissue 340 x 60 x 10mm.  The specimen is examined for nodules.  There is a 5mm pale nodule on the surface of the omental tissue.  No other other nodules seen.  
Blocks: 1 - the 5mm nodule; 2 & 3 - representative omental tissue.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of tan/yellow solid tissue 20 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes" consists of fragments of adipose tissue 38 x 25 x 10mm in aggregate.  There are up to four lymph nodes the largest is 20mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - three likely lymph nodes.  
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 45 x 25 x 10mm.  There is a 15 x 8 x 6mm lymph node.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node.  
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas peritoneum" consists of a tan/haemorrhagic piece of solid tissue 15 x 6 x 5mm.   BAE 1 block.
 
I.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid fat" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 16 x 12 x 6mm.  It has a yellow/grey staining cut surface.  BAE 1 block.  
  
J. Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of a vermiform appendix 65mm long and up to 6mm in diameter with attached mesoappendiceal fat 55 x 22 x 12mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and appears slightly congested.  The mucosal surface appears normal.  
Blocks: 1 - the tip bisected in LS and two TS; 2 - five TS; 3 - the base bisected in LS.  All of the vermiform appendix embedded.   (PL/ta 10/4/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr W Swineford):
A.Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of the right ovary, also involving the fimbrial end of the right tube.
B.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the distal end of the lefttube, including the smooth muscle wall and mucosa.
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is proliferative.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.
C.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of the left ovary.
D.  Sections show one tiny deposit of serous carcinoma in the omentum.
E, H, I & J.  Sections show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, the right fimbrial end of the tube and the distal left fallopian tube.  One tiny deposit is also present in the omentum.  Five lymph nodes are negative.
