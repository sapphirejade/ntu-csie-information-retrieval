CLINICAL:
Hx of R breast carcinoma for WLE and SNBx. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary lymph node", consists of one lymph node 15 x 15 x 10mm.  AE 2 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast cancer short superior, long lateral, medium medial", consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue with three sutures for orientation as above, measuring 60mm medial to lateral, 30mm superficial to deep margin and 60mm superior to inferior. The medial margin is inked red, the lateral margin is inked green, superficial blue, deep margin black. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into ten slices; slice 1 superior margin, slice 10 inferior margin.  On section, in slices 4-10 is an ill defined white and firm area measuring 35mm from superior to inferior, up to 20mm from medial to lateral and up to 40mm from superficial to deep.  Macroscopicallythe lesion abuts the medial and deep margins.  The specimen is AE according to the attached diagram. 
Blocks 1 & 2 - superior margin (slice 1); 3 & 4- slice 2; 6-7 - slice 3; 8-11 - slice 4; 12-17 - slice 5; 18-22 - slice 6; 23-26 - slice 7; 27-30 - slice 8; 31-33 - slice 9; 34-35 - slice 10.  (TO: ZJ: QP/ec 9.2.62)

Miscellaneous:
The uninvolved breast tissue is mainly fatty with small areas of fibrosis.  Some of the ducts are mildly dilated. Occasional small lobular calcifications are seen (slide B9).  Foci of columnar cell change are present.  Occasional lobules show secretory changes.

COMMENT
The slides have also been shown to A/Prof LOGAN PETRUNGER.  The tumour shows features suggesting a basal phenotype.

CONCLUSION
Right breast (wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy):  Invasive ductal carcinoma (NOS), 12mm, clear of margins by 8mm or more, modified Bloom and Richardson grade 3, with no metastases in one sentinel node.
ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (20.2.62)
Four unstained slides were sent to TRESILLIAN FAMILY CARE CENTRE - BELMORE Hospital for Her2 CISH analysis and their report is as follows:
"Material received:
12Q89177A93 unstained slides x 4.
Clinical Details:
R breast ca - WLE and SNBIHC result: Negative
Results:
Signal detection has been performed for the HER2 gene that maps to chromosome 17q21 using Invitrogen SpotLight detection system. 
HER2 CISH result: Negative.
TUMOUR STATUS: Non-amplified (diploid)
Mean HER2 gene copies per cell: 2.2
SCORING CRITERIA (Updated in line with ASCO/CAP recommendations):
	Non amplified (diploid) = 1-2.5 copies
  	Non amplified (polysomic)  >2.5-4 copies 
	Equivocal - 4-6 copies
	Amplified > 6 copies
Summary
Right breast tumour: HER2 negative.
