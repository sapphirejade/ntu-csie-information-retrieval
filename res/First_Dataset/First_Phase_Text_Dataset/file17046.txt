Grade 1 endometrial cancer on curettings.
Small pieces of tumour and normal taken for study (NL 13.1.66)


MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, tubes and ovaries&amp;#8220;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 45g in total. The uterus measures 65 x 30 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a fungating endometrial tumour measuring 30 x 10 x 5mm (in height).  The tumour invades to a depth of 5mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 14mm.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  The endometrium away from the tumour is less than 1mm in maximum thickness.  The tumour is located primarily on the posterior surface, with a small part on the anterior wall.  The left fallopian tube measures 30mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm and the left ovary measures 20 x 10 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length with a maximum diameter of 7mm and the right ovary measures 25 x 12 x 5mm.  The ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.  All of the endometrium of the posterior body, and left and right ovaries and left and right fallopian tubes are submitted for histopathology.
Blocks 1-3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 &amp;amp; 5 - RS tumour on anterior body; 6-8 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 12-13 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 14 &amp;amp; 15- full LS posterior body and cervix; 16 - fimbrial end right fallopian tube and RS ovary; 17 &amp;amp; 18 - right ovary and attached fallopian tube; 19 - fimbrial end and TS left ovary; 20 to  23 - left ovary TS.

B. Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left external iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of a single piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 10 x 10mm.  Specimen contains a single possible lymph node measuring up to 5mm in length.  Specimen serially sliced, TS, AE in 2 blocks.

C. Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omentum&amp;#8220;, consists of a piece of omentum measuring 30 x 30 x 10mm. Serially sliced, TS, AE in 3 blocks. (TO:  MS/ec  16.1.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Illovsky):
A.  Sections of the cervix show that some of the ectocervical squamous epithelium is denuded and there is a moderate infiltrate of mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells in the superficial stroma; this change may relate to uterine prolapse.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  There is superficial myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 2mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 15mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Tumour extends into the lower uterine segment but there is no cervical involvement.  There is some adenomyosis in the myometrium.
A section of the left ovary shows a small vessel at the hilum with fibrinoid necrosis of its wall and a moderate surrounding chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate; the features are consistent with a focal vasculitis.  No other similar vessels are seen elsewhere and the focal vasculitis is almost certainly of no significance.  The left ovary is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the right ovary and of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

Stains for mismatch repair enzymes have been performed on the endometrial tumour:
MLH1:  Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:  Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:  Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:  Preserved nuclear staining.

Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MHL1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).

B.  Sections show one (1) lymph node. The node has an unusual pattern of large, irregular reactive follicles and monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia.  There is no metastatic carcinoma and no particular features to suggest malignant lymphoma are seen with routine or immunostains.

C.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:
1.  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing superficial myometrial invasion.  Stage 1A.
2.  Adenomyosis.
3.  Focal vasculitis left ovary, see text.

B.  Left external iliac lymph node:  Prominent reactive changes, no tumour (0/1).

C.  Omental biopsy:  No abnormality seen.
