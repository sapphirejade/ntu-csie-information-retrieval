ltrpar92HISTORY:
Peritonectomy and HIPEC DPAM. Spleen, gallbladder, right hemicolectomy and omentectomy.
id13525137
MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;#8220;COLON, BILATERAL OVARIES, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN&amp;#8221;. Gallbladder, right hem icolectomy, spleen with attached omental tissue, one ovary and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum and ovoid gallstone.
Gallbladder measuring 55mm in length and 12mm in maximum diameter. The seros a is roughened and disrupted over an area measuring 20x10mm. The wall is up to 6mm thick. The mucosa is granular green with strips of cholesterolosis. No stones found within the lumen. One stone found floating in formalin measuring 25mm i n maximum dimension.
(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).
Right hemicolectomy: Comprising of seminal ileum, caecum, ascending colon, proximal aspect of transverse colon and appendix with at tached mesocolic fat and omental tissue. It measures 290mm in length with proximal diameter of 20mm, distal diameter of 30mm. The terminal ileum measures 80mm, ascending colon 140mm, transverse colon 70mm, caecum 30mm in depth. Attached a ppendix is 40mm in length and ranging in diameter from 10-40mm. Attached mesocolic fat is 80mm, attached omentum is 170mm. The serosal surface shows area of multiple adhesions. On opening the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds. The ileoc aecal valve shows submucosal lipoma. No discrete lesions are identified. The appendix shows dilation at the tip with disruption of the serosa. Within this area of disruption are mucinous deposits of tumour. The dilated aspect is ?dilated  tip, ?ovary. On sectioning through the omentum, no obvious tumour deposits identified. The tip of appendix is dilated, disrupted tip of appendix it is not ?ovary.
(3 proximal and distal margin of right hemicolectomy; 4 ileoca ecal valve showing submucosal lipoma; 5-9 sections through distal aspect of appendix showing appendix in relation to disrupted mass with mucinous deposit; 10-13 further sections of dilated aspect of appendix/?ovary; 14 two TS mid appendix ; 15 base of appendix; 16 section through ascending colon showing serosal roughening; 17 omentum. In the mesocolon eleven possible nodes identified; 18 five nodes; 19 one node bisected; 20 one node bisected; 21 four nodes).
S pleen with attached omentum. The spleen weighs 163g and measures 120x80x32mm. The capsule is roughened with areas of adhesion. On sectioning the cut surface is red and spongy in appearance. No discrete lesions identified. Attached omentum  measures 210x200x15mm. On sectioning through the omental tissue no discrete lesions identified.
(22&amp;amp;23 spleen; 24&amp;amp;25 omentum).
Cystic mass consistent with ovary attached with peritoneum. The cystic mass weighs  35g and measures 50x40x30mm. The surface is covered by mucinous deposits of tumour. On sectioning the cut surface reveals a multiloculated cyst filled with mucinous material. The inner lining appears smooth. The attached peritoneum is 250 x150x10mm.
(26-29 cystic mass; 30 attached peritoneum).
Second ovary with attached peritoneum. Ovary weighs 5g and measures 25x15x10mm. The surface shows ?mucinous deposit of tumour. On sectioning the cut surfac e shows a tan normal appearing cut surface. The attached peritoneum/fibrofatty piece of tissue measures 280x180x70mm. No tumour deposits or discrete mass lesions identified.
(31 ovary; 32 ?tumour block &amp;#8211; Note use bloc k 29 as tumour block). RS (M-32/MC/ht).
Further blocks of appendix and ovary:  (33 base of appendix; 34 one TS appendix; 35-41 sections of dilated aspect of appendix; 42-52 ovary/cystic mass).  RS (M-52)

MICROSCOPIC:5137     (Dr X Sabbatini)
Sections of the gallbladder show features of chronic cholecystitis.  O n the serosal surface there are adhesions as well as acellular mucin pools.
The appendix and the cystic mass contain an intraluminal proliferation with a villous architecture with intermediate and focal high grade cytologic a typia including multilayering, and mitotic activity. Focally irregularly shaped glands are seen in dense fibrous tissue. Strips and groups of epithelial cells are seen within the mucin adjacent to the point of rupture of the cystic mass,  however the extruded mucin is predominantly acellular with fibrous reaction.
There is serosal organisation of acelluar mucus deposit on the colonic serosa.  Acellular mucus is seen on the surface of the omentum.  Nine lymph nod es are identified in the colonic mesentery and these show reactive changes only.
The sections of the spleen show normal appearing parenchyma.  On the serosal surface there are focal acellular extracellular mucus deposits with  associated mesothelial reaction.
Sections of the omentum show acellular extracellular mucus deposits with fibrotic and mesothelial reaction.
Sections of the cystic mass with ovary show cystically dilated space s with mucin as well as spaces in which there is a complex papillary epithelial proliferation with columnar mucinous epithelium with multilayering intermediate and focal high grade nuclear atypia and many mitotic figures.  In several area s there is an underlying desmoplastic stromal reaction.  There is also organising surface mucus with associated strips of columnar mucinous epithelium with low to intermediate grade atypia.
The other ovary shows adjacent fa llopian tube.  There is acellular mucin deposit with mesothelial reaction on the surface of the ovary.
Comment:  The a ppearances of the appendiceal tumour are those of intermediate and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Similarf1 epithelial changes are seen in the infiltrative tumour of the ovary and this has morphology  consistent with low to intermediate grade mucinous adenocarcinoma.
