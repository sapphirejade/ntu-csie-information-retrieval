HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Rec PMP.  Note HIV positive.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Two segments of small bowel and multiple pieces of fibrotic tissue including mucinous material.  The first segment of small bowel measures 255mm in length with a maximum diameter of 40mm.  The second segment of small bowel measures 170mm in length with a maximum diameter of 35mm.  Both have roughened serosa and are covered by mucinous tumour deposit. One margin inked black, the other blue.  On sectioning through the longer segment, it shows loops of small bowel adherent to itself.

(1-5  sections from longer segment of small bowel [1&amp;amp;2  margins, 3,4&amp;amp;5  further sections showing mucinous tumour deposit]).

The mucosa of the shorter segment of small bowel shows normal mucosal folds.

(6  margins; 7  sections showing roughened serosa; 8  two possible nodes from mesocolic fat).

The separate fibrotic pieces of tissue including mucinous material, altogether measure 230x170x50mm.  The fibrous tissue fragments are covered by a mucinous tumour deposit.

(9-11  representative sections of fibrotic tissue fragment).

Also within the fragment is what appears to be an ileostomy site.  It measures 30mm in diameter, 35mm in length.  There is a rim of skin measuring 2mm maximum dimension.

(12  sectioned through possible ileostomy site).  RS (M-12/MC 29/8/2067 km).

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr G Ollhoff)
Sections show involvement of the serosal segment of the small bowel and fragments of peritoneum by low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis / DPAM).  The tumour is characterised by abundant extracellular mucin dissecting through connective tissue planes in association with scattered foci of columnar mucinous epithelium in strips and occasional low papillae.  The epithelium shows minimal nuclear atypia.  There are no high grade cytologic or architectural features. Signet ring cells are not seen.

The small bowel mucosa is unremarkable.

Sections also confirm an ileostomy stoma.  There are reactive and inflammatory changes in the small bowel mucosa adjacent to the stoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
SMALL BOWEL SEGMENTS, PERITONEUM AND ILEOSTOMY STOMA -
-INVOLVEMENT OF THE SEROSAL ASPECT OF THE SMALL BOWEL SEGMENTS AND PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS BY LOW GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI.  ILEOSTOMY STOMA WITH REACTIVE CHANGES.
