CLINICAL:
70yr old with ovarian cancer, received two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Interval debulking performed 20 January 2063.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 30mm in length with a maximum diameter of 7mm.  The ovary measures 40 x 40 x 35mm.  One end of theovary is a cyst measuring 35 x 35 x 30mm.  The cyst is uniloculated with a maximum wall thickness of 4mm.  No papillary excrescences are seen.  The parovarian tissue measures 45 x 20 x 20mm and has a solid cream cut surface.  Sections of the fallopian tube appear to be traversing this tissue.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative fallopian tube; 3 - representative ovary; 4 & 5 - representative ovarian cyst; 6 - representative parovarian tissue.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a piece of tissue including fallopian tube and ovary that appears distorted by multiple fibrous adhesions.  The tissue measures 50 x 35 x 25mm.  The fallopian tubeappears to measure 50mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.  The ovary appears to measure 40 x 30 x 20mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is solid with several small cystic spaces ranging from 3 to 5mm constituting less than 5% of the ovarian volume.  Blocks: 1-2- representative fallopian tubes; 3 to 5- representative ovary.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists oftwo pieces of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 40 x 25mm and 60 x 45 x 20mm.  On sectioning the tissue appears to be largely replaced by tumour.  Representative sections 3 blocks.
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Colon nodule" consists of a cream nodule measuring 18 x 15 x 10mm.  On sectioning the nodule has a soft yellow cut surface.  TAE 1 block. 
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic peritoneum" consistsof a piece of fibrous tissue measuring 25 x 20 x 10mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block.  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Mesenteric lymph node" consists of three pieces of fatty tissue containing lymph nodes measuring 25 x 20 x 120mm in aggregate.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected.  
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel nodule" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue 5 and 6mm and a piece of cream fibrous tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 2mm.  Largest piece serially sectioned.   AE 1 block.   (UA/ta 21/2/63) 
  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Mcnespey): 
A & B.  Sections show chemotherapy affected serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, both tubes and the paradnexal soft tissues.
C, E & G.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections show a well circumscribed area of fat necrosis with tiny deposits of serous carcinoma on the serosa.
F.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, both tubes, paradnexal soft tissue, omentum, pelvic peritoneum and bowel.
