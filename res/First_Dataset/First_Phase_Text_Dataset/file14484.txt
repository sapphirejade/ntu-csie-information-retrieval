A. Sections show dilated fallopian tube with patchy flattening of the tubal epithelium and hypertrophy of the muscle layer, consistent with the clinical impression of a hydrosalpinx. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
B. Sections show proliferative endometrium.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right fallopian tube: consistent with hydrosalpinx

B. Uterine curettings:  Proliferative endometrium.
