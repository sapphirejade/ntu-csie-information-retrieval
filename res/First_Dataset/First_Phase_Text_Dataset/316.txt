F.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue", consists of fibrofatty tissue with attached ellipse of skin measuring 45 x 28mm.  There are three marking sutures as specified. The ellipse of skin appears unremarkable.  The specimen is inked as follows: blue superficial, deep black, green superior, red inferior and serially sliced from medial to lateral into ten slices.  The cut surface shows a firm pale nodular lesion in slices 4-8.  The lesion measures 38mm inferior to superior, 25mm superficial to deep and 32mm medial to lateral.Representative sections.  Block 1 & 2- medial margin representative slices; 3 & 4 - paired blocks slice 2; 5 & 6 - paired blocks slice 3; 7 & 8 - paired blocks slice 4; 9-14 - paired blocks slice 5; 15-20 - paired blocks slice 6; 21 & 22 - paired blocks slice 7; 23 & 24 - paired blocks slice 8; 25 & 26 - paired blocks slice 9; 27-28 - representative of lateral margin slice 10.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Thoe):
A to F.  Sections show breast tissue with a 38mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS.  Three out of eighteen lymph nodes show deposits of metastatic carcinoma.  One of the three involved nodes is the sentinel node (specimen A).  A synoptic report follows:

The lower axillary (Specimen C) and apical lymph nodes (Specimen D) are amongst the nodes that show no evidence of metastaticcarcinoma.
Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined (including sentinel node(s)):  18   
Total number of involved lymph nodes (including sentinel node(s)):  3   
DIAGNOSIS:
A to F.  Sentinel nodes, apical nodes, right axillary dissection and right breast tissue:
-  38mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS, pT2 N1a
-  Three lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma.  Two of the metastatic deposits (one of which is a sentinel node - Specimen A) are >2.0mm and the third show isolated tumour cells <0.2mm.
 
Block F9 has been sent to EMERALD HOSPITAL Hospital for HER2 CISH and a supplementary report will follow as soon as the result becomes available.


ADDITIONAL REPORT, 12/6/63:
Material was sent to Dr H Vogland, Anatomical Pathology, ST GEORGE'S HEALTH SERVICE Hospital, for HER-2 In-Situ Hybridisation analysis, the results of which are as follows:
HER-2 IHC result:  1+ at POWH
Signal Detectionhas been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche).
HER2 Dual ISH result:  NEGATIVE (nonamplified, diploid)
Mean HER2 copy number per cell:  2.5
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell:  2.25
HER2/CEP17 Ratio:  1.11
SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):
Negative:  HER2/CEP17 < 1.8
Equivocal:  HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2
Positive:  HER2/CEP17 >2.2
