Subcutaneous sarcoma - leiomyosarcoma on core (done in ROSEBERY).


MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Sarcoma right upper thigh stitch 12 o&amp;apos;clock&amp;#8220;, consists of an orientated ellipse of skin and subcutis measuring 110 x 40mm to a depth of 20mm. There is a single suture in place designated 12 o&amp;apos;clock.  The 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin is inked blue, 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is inked black and deep margin is inked red. The specimen is sliced into fourteen slices from 12-6 o&amp;apos;clock. The cut surface shows a circumscribed pale white nodule measuring 20 x 20 x 10mm.  The lesion lies 4mm from deep margin, 23mm from 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 11mm from 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 13mm from superficial/ skin.  The rest of the tissue is uniformly fatty.
Block 1 &amp;amp; 2 - representative sections of the 12 o&amp;apos;clock margin; 3 - representative sections of slice 2; 4-6 - slice 4; 8-10 - slice 5; 11-13 - slice 6; 14-16 - slice 7; 17 - representative sections of slice 8; 18-20 - slice 9; 21 - representative sections of slice 11; 22 &amp;amp; 23 - slice 13; 24 &amp;amp; 25 - representative sections of 6 o&amp;apos;clock.  See diagram.   (LM/ec   16.12.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Ards and registrar Dr V Femrite):
Sections of skin and subcutis show a 20mm well-circumscribed tumour within the subcutaneous tissue.  The tumour is composed of spindle cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, blunted nuclei, and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour cells are arranged in fascicles and display moderate-to-severe nuclear atypia. There is no necrosis.   Mitoses are frequent (9 per 10 hpf); the Ki67 index is approximately 20%.  The tumour is positive for desmin and SMA, and negative for S100, SOX10 and myogenin.  There is very focal non-specific staining with panCK.  These findings are consistent with a leiomyosarcoma.  The tumour is 2mm clear of the (closest) deep margin.  All other margins are well clear (greater than 10mm).  The surrounding adipose tissue and overlying skin show no significant abnormality.


DIAGNOSIS:
Right upper thigh:  Leiomyosarcoma, completely excised
