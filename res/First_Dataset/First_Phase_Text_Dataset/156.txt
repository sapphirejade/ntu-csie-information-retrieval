Distribution:  DR Vuoso,  FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY

CLINICAL:
Proximal gastric Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Hepatic lymph node" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 15 x 15 x 7 and 30 x 15 x 15mm.  There are lymph node within each of the specimen measuring 15 and 17mm respectively.  AE 2 blocks.
(TO: BR; IC/rt 2.8.63)
B.  Specimen labelled "Gastrectomy" consists of a total gastrectomy measuring 180 x90 x 45mm.  The greater curvature measures 220mm and the lesser curvature measures 180mm.  There is no oesophageal cuff present.  The lesser omentum measures 10 x 60 x 20mm and greater omentum measures 420 x 150 x 20mm. The lesser omentum is adherent to the serosal surface of the stomach on the anterior wall. The proximal margin is inked blue and the distal margin is inked black.  On opening there is an ulcerated tumour anteriorly near the lesser curve, 35mm from the proximal surgical margin and 110mm from the distal surgical margin.  The tumour measures approximately 20x 20mm in area.  The rest of the stomach mucosa appears unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1- proximal surgical margin; 2 - distal surgical margin; 3 - tumour and closest proximal surgical margin; 4 to 11 - tumour AE; 12 - LS of distal mucosa to tumour; 13 - normal body; 14 -normal antrum and lymph node from lesser curvature; 15 to 20 - ?lymph nodes from greater curvature.  (TO: RJ; VD/rt 2.8.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Koulavongsa):
A. Sections show two reactive lymph nodes with lipogranulomas and mild sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
B. Sections show gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type. A synoptic report follows.
