CLINICAL:
Multifocal right breast cancer.  Large focus upper inn quadrant.  Tumour also in axillary tail.  ?Tumour 7 o'clock.  Neoadjuvant chemo.  R mastectomy and R axillary clearance level 1 & 2.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast lateral" consists of a total mastectomy specimen measuring 183 x 130 x 55mm with an overlying skin ellipse measuring 180 x 70mm. The nipple areola complex measures 40 x 50mm.  The epidermal surface of the skin ellipse is unremarkable.  The deep margin is inked black, superficial green.  On serial sectioning there is a hard cream nodule in the upper inner quadrant measuring 20 x 13 x 20mm.  The lesion comes close to the medial margin.  Macroscopically it is 13mmfrom the deep margin and 7mm from the superficial margin and is located 60mm from the nipple.  There is a second nodule which may correspond to the 7 o'clock lesion in the lower quadrant at approximately at 6 o'clock measuring 15 x 6 x 8mm.  This nodule is 25mm from the deep margin and 35mm from the superficial margin.  No definite lesion is identified in the axillary tail.  
Blocks: 1 - UIQ lesion closest to medial margin; 2- UIQ lesion; 3- UIQ lesion with deepmargin; 4 - UIQ lesion with superficial margin; 5 - nodule two; 6 - deep margin closest to nodule 2; 7 - superficial margin closest to nodule 2; 8 - representative firm axillary tissue; 9 - deep margin closest to tissue in block 8; 10 - superficial margin closest to tissuein block 8; 11 - further firm nodular area in axilla; 12 - closest deep margin to block 11; 13 - closest superficial margin to block 11; 14 - representative upper inner quadrant superior to tumour; 15 - representative upper inner quadrant lateral to UIQ lesion; 16 - further representative breast lateral to UIQ lesion; 17 & 18 - representative lower inner quadrant; 19- representative upper outer quadrant superior to nodule two; 20- representative upper outer quadrant; 21& 22 - representative lower outer quadrant; 23 - representative nipple; 24 - possible lymph node axillary tail; 25 - lymph node axillary tail.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Level one and two right axilla" consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue 100 x 80 x 20mm.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one lymph node bisected; 5 & 6 - one lymph node bisected; 7 - one lymph node bisected; 8 - one lymph node bisected; 9 to 15 - lymph nodes.  (VX/ta 14/6/63)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr F Scripps):
A & B.   Sections show two foci of ductal carcinoma, one within the upper inner quadrant and the other at 7 o'clock.  Grading and immunohistochemical studies may be unreliable due to prior therapy effect.  The features are as follows:
