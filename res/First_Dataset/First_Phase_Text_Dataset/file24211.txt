Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
48 year old, left metastatic breast cancer (lobular carcinoma, ER/PR positive), mets to liver and ? bony lesion.  On Lyrica and Tamoxifen.  For BSO.  Recent L) mastectomy with removal of lymph nodes Dec 2066.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube / fimbria 50mm in length and 10mm in diameter and attached ovary 60 x 30 x 25mm.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface.  There are multiple paratubal cysts 2 - 5mm across filled with clear liquid.  The ovary has a thin wall cyst 15mm in diameter filled with clear liquid which shows no internal solid part.  Also there is a haemorrhagic / mucoid cyst 8mm across.  The rest of the ovary has a diffuse firm pale appearance. Blocks:  1 - Frozen section 1, 2 - Frozen section 2, 3 - two LS fimbria including paratubal cyst, 4 to 6 - the rest of the fallopian tube with underlying ovary from distal to proximal, 7 to 9 - the rest of haemorrhagic cyst, 10 to 11 - simple cyst, 12 to 21 - the rest of ovary.  AE 21 blocks.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast.  Reported by Dr TERRANCE PIERRIE and DUNCAN CARBONEAU to anaesthetist at 11:20am on 04/01/2017.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube / fimbria 50mm in length and 6mm in diameter with attached ovary 30 x 20 x 15mm and soft tissue 30 x 15 x 5mm.  The ovary has a smooth and shiny outer surface.  The fallopian tube shows a paratubal cyst 5mm across filled with clear liquid.  Blocks: 1 - Two LS fimbria including paratubal cyst, 2 to 3 -TS of entire fallopian tube, 4 to 9 - entire ovary and adjacent soft tissue.  AE 9 blocks.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Endometrial curettings&amp;quot;, consists of scanty amounts of tan tissue mixed with blood clot and mucoid material 6 x 6 x 1mm.  Please note the specimen is scanty and may not survive processing and mostly includes clots and mucoid material.  AE 1 block.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, a piece of omental fat, 40 x 20 x 5mm which appears unremarkable.  No lymph nodes or lesions are identified.  AE 3 blocks.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right anterior abdominal peritoneum&amp;quot;, a piece of tan tissue with the smooth surface at one side, 15 x 8 x 2mm.  No lesions are identified.  Sliced into 4.  AE 1 block. (TO: LN; LN/eh 8/3/2067)


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr B Worth):
A &amp;amp; B.   Sections show metastatic lobular carcinoma extensively involving both ovaries, the right fallopian tube, and bilateral paradnexal soft tissues.  The left fallopian tube is uninvolved.  No tubal dysplasia is seen.
ER, PR and HER2 stains are pending.

C.  Sections show weakly proliferative endometrium.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.

D.  The omentum shows numerous small scattered deposits of metastatic lobular carcinoma.

E.   Sections show metastatic lobular carcinoma.


DIAGNOSIS:
Metastatic lobular carcinoma involving both ovaries, the right fallopian tube, paradnexal soft tissues, the omentum, and the right anterior abdominal peritoneum.


ADDITIONAL REPORT 14/3/67:
The carcinoma is strongly positive for ER and PR, and negative for Her2.
