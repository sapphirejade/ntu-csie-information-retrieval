29R30720 (29R307203C) LESE, KOORI MARCEL  HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Appendiceal cancer.  Liver.  Diaphragm strip.  Spleen. Omentum. Rectum/pelvis. Ileocolon.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, DIAPHRAGM, SPLEEN, RIGHT COLON, RECTOSIGMOID, LEFT LIVER, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received multiple tissue fragments in one jar, all appears involved with a disseminated white nodular surface deposits.
- The largest fragment is an en bloc specimen contains right and left colon adherent to each other by omental cake diffusely infiltrated by firm white deposit and peritoneal strips with multiple (up to 20 white deposits) measuring 5x15mm.  The right colon specimen contains a terminal ileum 90x35mm, caecum and ascending colon 125x110mm.  The rectosigmoid specimen measures 230x60mm with distal 40mm is below the anterior peritoneal reflection. No appendix is identified. The previously white deposit is also present at the anterior peritoneal reflection and the rectosigmoid area over 55x20mm.  The mucosal surfaces are unremarkable.  No polyps or tumours are identified.  No definite appendix is seen.  Attached to the peritoneum is a piece of skin (consistent with umbilicus) measuring 65x15mm.  The cut surface of the umbilicus reveals firm white tissue (? lesion) infiltrating the underlying fat to reach the attached peritoneum.  (1 right hemicolectomy proximal and distal margins; 2 rectosigmoid proximal margin; 3 rectosigmoid distal margin; 4&amp;amp;5 umbilicus involvement; 6 terminal ileum; 7 caecum; 8&amp;amp;9 continuous slices dense involvement of ileum mesentery; 10 four lymph node right colon; 11 sigmoid involvement; 12 rectal involvement; 13&amp;amp;14 omentum cake with 14 tissue block for tumour banking; 15 peritoneal strip involvement)
- A length of small bowel measuring 110x35mm with attached mesocolon up to 25mm.  A nodule is identified on the serosal surface measuring 15mm and involves the adjacent mesocolon.  No mucosal polyps or tumours are identified.  (16 RS serosal involvement)
- A segment of liver of a total weight of 166g measuring 145x65x55mm. The surgical resection margin is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sliced. The liver parenchyma is homogenous, brown.  At the resection there is a white firm nodule measuring 35x15x15mm, appears surrounding a possible tubular structure (? ligament/? vessel) and is abutting the resection margin macroscopically. (17 normal liver; 18&amp;amp;19 RS nodule)
- A spleen total weight of 158g measuring 110x90x45 mm. Firm white deposits are identified on the outer surface, largest measures 10mm at the hilum.  Attached is a piece of fibrofatty tissue consistent with omentum measuring 255x110x10 mm and has disseminated involvement (up to 80%) with firm white nodules 3-5mm in maximum diameter.
(20&amp;amp;21 capsular involvement; 22 hilar involvement; 23 omental nodule)
- gallbladder 95x35x30 mm.  The outer surface is involved at the neck area by firm white deposits measuring 10mm and 15mm.  They appear clear of the cystic duct resection margin by 35mm. The wall is up to 4mm thick, becomes thickened at the area of nodular involvement up to 8mm.  The mucosal surface is green and granular.  Seven calculi are identified 5-10mm in maximum diameter. (24 cystic duct and TS neck [involved]; 25 TS body [involved and LS fundus)
- A firm white fibrous piece of tissue with attached muscle consistent with diaphragm measuring 155x135x15 mm about 70% is involved and thickened by firm white deposits.
(26&amp;amp;27 diaphragmatic involvement). RS (M-27/ZH/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:
The tissue in the caecum/terminal ileum and adjacent mesentery is markedly distorted with involvement of mesentery by carcinoma. However no appendix is seen.
Sections of the peritoneal tumour deposits show:
- metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma without signet ring cells, which could also be classified as:
- high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei/PMCA (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis) if from appendix.
The tumour is predominantly mucinous but has some non-mucinous adenocarcinoma areas and has variable patterns, but in nearly all areas the mucin is at least moderately cellular with plentiful epithelium arranged in strips, clusters, cribriform groups and single cells. There is definite invasion present in most areas of the tumour with the deepest level of invasion into muscularis propria of rectum approximately 3 mm, with deep invasion into mesenteric fat and omentum &amp;gt;  10 mm, and invasion into subumbilical subcutaneous tissue.
There is tumour involvement of subumbilical tissue, terminal ileum, caecum, ileum mesentery, attached rectum, omentum, peritoneum, the separate piece of small bowel, liver hilum, surface of gallbladder, surface of spleen, and there is involvement of skeletal muscle, probably diaphragm tissue.
See previous report for mismatch repair protein.
Four lymph nodes were recovered from the specimen, these are free of tumour.
There is focal lymphovascular invasion (block 12).
Comment:
The appearances would be consistent with appendix origin in the proper clinical setting but other organ of origin is possible.
The appendix has not been idenitified ?previously removed.
The tumour appearances are similar to the previous biopsy specimen reviewed from 28/2/2066 (CHS Inc report 29R30720).
DIAGNOSIS:
RESECTION OF MULTIPLE INTRA-ABDOMINAL/PERITONEAL TISSUES:
- metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma without signet ring cells(if of uncertain organ origin)
or:
- high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei/PMCA (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis), if of appendix origin.
- lymphovascular invasion present

Supplementary report 9/4/2067 further tissue:
Further tissue: (31 ?collection at the base of the caecum; 32-35 lymph nodes around the ileocaecal valve region [32 five lymph nodes; 33 one lymph node, trisected, ?involved; 34 one lymph node bisected; 35 five lymph nodes). RS (M-35/ZH/cy)

In the further examined lymph nodes from ileocaecal region, one lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma.

LYMPH NODES:
Site: Ileocaecal region
Positive (involved)
Lymph nodes examined: 	13
Positive lymph nodes: 	1
Largest metastatic deposit: 	13 mm diameter
Other lymph nodes (L colon mesentery lymph nodes x 2) are not involved. There are extranodal tumour deposits in left colon mesentery and numerous extranodal deposits in ileocaecal mesentery.
Other findings:
A section of ureter is present in the left colon sections.
Provisional stage: pT0 (primary tumour not identified) pN1 pM1a

Staging by TNM 7th ed 2010

ANNENDED DIAGNOSIS: (after further lymph node examination):

RESECTION OF MULTIPLE INTRA-ABDOMINAL/PERITONEAL TISSUES:
- metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma without signet ring cells (if of uncertain organ origin), (intraperitoneal metastases)
or:
- high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei/PMCA (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis), if of appendix origin (intraperitoneal metastases)
- lymphovascular invasion present
- lymph node metastasis present (1/13 ileocolic nodes positive)
