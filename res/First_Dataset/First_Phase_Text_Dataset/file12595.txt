Pathology ReportSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (1.8.2066)

CLINICAL:
Ovarian cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right ovary plus right tube&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube with adherent ovary attached.  The fallopian tube measures 36mm in length with an outer diameter of 7mm.  The ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  AE 10 blocks.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - fallopian tube; 3 to 10 - ovary plus para-adnexal tissue.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left side wall peritoneum plus left ovary and tube&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube with adherent ovary plus fatty tissue.  The whole tissue measures 470 x 50 x 20mm.  The fallopian tube measures 35mm in length with an outer diameter of 7mm.  The ovary measures 28 x 20 x 15mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is cystic filled with clear to yellowish fluid.  No papillary excresences or solid areas seen.  Adherent fat measures 50 x 40 x 15mm.  The cut surface is uniformly fatty.  No lesion is seen.
Blocks: 1 to 15 - all adnexal tissue. (1 &amp;amp; 2 - fallopian tube; 3 to 8 - ovarian tissue; 9 to 15 - adherent fatty tissue).

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue measuring 190 x 110 x 30mm.  The cut surface shows uniform fatty tissue.  RS embedded in 3 blocks.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Caecum nodule&amp;quot;, consists of a single pale tan tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.  (LM/ta 4/8/66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Seidlitz):
A.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma with psammomatous calcification involving the surface of the ovary, paraovarian soft tissue and paratubal soft tissue.  The fallopian tube otherwise show no significant abnormality.

B.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving adnexal soft tissue.  The ovary shows a benign serous cystadenoma and the fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.

C.  Sections of omentum show extensive involvement by a high grade serous carcinoma.

D.  Sections show a focally calcified benign fibrotic nodule.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A - D.  Right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, omentum and caecal nodule:
- High grade serous carcinoma involving surface of right ovary, right paratubal soft tissue, bilateral paraovarian soft tissue and omentum.
- Benign serous cystadenoma of left ovary.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr D Carvin 1.8.2066):
MSI immunohistochemistry was performed as requested at the Gynaecological Oncology Tumour Board Meeting on 22.8.2066.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
