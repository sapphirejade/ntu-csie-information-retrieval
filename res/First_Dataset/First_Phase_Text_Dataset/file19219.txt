HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Peritonectomy for PMP.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple components:

Part 1 is a gallbladder.
Received intact, measuring 70mm in length, 30mm in diameter. The cystic duct opening is not identified. The serosa is rough and covered in multiple gelatinous appearing tumours, up to 25mm in size. The mucosa is unremarkable, green, velvety. The wall thickness is 6mm. No stones are identified.

Part 2 consists of spleen which is adherent to omentum with a combined dimension of 350x170x40mm. The entire piece of omentum and spleen is covered in a mucinous tumour with estimated dimension, 300x140x30mm. The spleen separated from the omentum weighs approximately 450mm. On sectioning of the spleen, parenchyma appears dark red with multiple gelatinous nodules within the splenic hilar fat, 40mm in cross-section. A piece of pancreatic tail is also noted, 20x20x15mm. Cut surface of the pancreatic tissue is unremarkable in appearance.

Interim block description:
(1 gallbladder, possible cystic duct and neck; 2 body and fundus; 3-6 omentum [3 tumour bank block]; 7&amp;amp;8 spleen hilum with pancreatic tissue and adherent tumour; 9 splenic artery and vein adjacent to tumour; 10 spleen cortex with adherent tumour; 11 spleen capsular surface with adhesions).

A second piece of omental cake is present, measuring 250x240x30mm. The omental cake is partially covered in a glistening tumour mass, 220x120x30mm.

Next part consists of a right hemicolon with adherent peritoneum. The right hemicolon consists of terminal ileum, 95mm in length, 25mm in diameter. Caecum with ascending colon, 200mm in length with a diameter ranging from 40-60mm. Mesocolic fat, 180x70x60mm. Adherent strips of peritoneum, 200x60x10mm, and 210x140x10mm. Attached to one of the strips of the peritoneum is subcutaneous fat, 40x35x35mm, with an ellipse of skin, 40x20mm, bearing an umbilicus, measuring 10x5mm. Multiple glistening nodules are seen covering the serosal surface of the right hemicolon, terminal ileum, peritoneum, and the mesocolic fat. A metastatic deposit is also seen, immediately deep to the umbilicus, 20x15x12mm. The skin itself is macroscopically unremarkable. On opening the large bowel and small bowel mucosa, appears unremarkable. No polyp is seen seen. No ulceration seen. ----the appendix, appendiceal opening is identified. No obvious appendix seen. At the location of the appendiceal opening, a glistening tumour is found which is partially cystic, 30x20mm in cross-section. The tumour extends to the surface of the caecum.

Interim block description:
(12 proximal ileal margin and distal large bowel margin; 13 ileocaecal valve and ileum with adherent tumour; 14&amp;amp;15 caecum with appendix insertion site; 16 caecum to posterior margin; 17 ascending colon, anterior serosa; 18 vascular pedicle with one bisected apical node; 19 four lymph nodes; 20 four lymph nodes; 21 one trisected lymph node; 22&amp;amp;23 one bisected lymph node each; 24&amp;amp;25 umbilicus with underlying tumour mass, composite block; 26 adherent strip of peritoneal tissue).

Next part consists of a left hemicolon with the following components:
Transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid and rectum. 720mm in length with a variable diameter from 20mm-235mm; mesocolic and mesorectal fat, 260x80x50mm; adherent strips of peritoneal tissue, up to 210x80x20mm, covering the exposed serosa and the peritoneum and mesocolic fat are multiple mucinous tumours forming a cake-like mass, 140x80mm in area, with glistening tumours extend also onto the adherent peritoneum. On sectioning, the large bowel mucosa appears unremarkable. The lumen appears compressed externally by tumour masses.

(27 proximal margin; 28 distal margin; 29 transverse colon; 30-----; 31 sigmoid colon; 32 vascular pedicle with two apical nodes; 33 distal vascular pedicle with one apical node; 34 four lymph nodes; 35 four lymph nodes; 36 tumour on surface of mesocolic fat; 37 tumour in adherent strips of peritoneum).

Multiple additional strips of peritoneum with fat also present, 160x140x50mm in aggregate. The strips of peritoneum are covered in multiple mucinous tumours, up to 50x30x20mm.

(38&amp;amp;39 sections from the separate pieces of peritoneum with fat). RS (M-39/ JC/cy)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. X Kuniyoshi)
Sections of gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis.  Within the surrounding fat, there is extensive deposition of mucin associated with chronic inflammation.  Within the mucin pools, there are strips of mucin-secreting epithelium present showing low grade atypia. Extensive deposition of mucin is also seen within the omentum, associated with mucin-secreting epithelium showing low grade atypia.  The intervening stroma between the mucin pools shows chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
Four lymph nodes are identified showing no evidence of metastatic tumour.
Sections show spleen show deposition of mucinous tumour on the capsular surface.  Within the splenic parenchyma, mucin pools with epithelium are also identified.  Mucinous tumour associated with abundant mucin pools is present adjacent to the pancreas.
Sections from the right hemicolectomy specimen show unremarkable small bowel mucosa.  Sections from the distal resection margin show serosal adhesions and subserosal deposition of mucin associated with mucin secreting epithelium with low grade atypia.  Mucin deposition associated with fibrosis and congestion is noted along the serosal surface of the colonic mucosa.  The ileocaecal valve shows pseudolipomatous change.  At the appendiceal orifice, the serosal surface of the bowel shows deposition of mucinous neoplasm.  There is tumour abutting muscularis propria, but does not appear to extend into the submucosa.  The appendiceal mucosa at the orifice shows reactive lymphoid follicles.
The tumour mass at the umbilicus shows deposition of mucin pool within the dermis.  Strips of atypical mucin secreting epithelium are noted within the mucin pools.  No evidence of metastatic tumour seen in 9 lymph nodes identified within the right hemicolon.
The left hemicolectomy specimen shows deposition of mucin and epithelium on the serosal surface of the colon at the distal resection margin.  Throughout the colon, deposition of mucinous epithelium of low and intermediate grade atypia is noted extending into the muscularis propria.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in 8 lymph nodes identified.
Comment:   Histology shows extensive involvement by mucinous tumour of predominantly  low grade atypia, consistent with the clinical appearance of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  There is involvement of the omentum, gallbladder serosa, spleen, umbilicus and colon, both right and left side.
DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON -
- LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM INVOLVING OMENTUM, COLON, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER SEROSA AND UMBILICUS
