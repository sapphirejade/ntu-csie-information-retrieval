CLINICAL:
BRCA risk reducing surgery.  For serial sectioning of the tube please.  Right salpingo-oophorectomy.  Left cyst wall. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right fallopian tube and ovary", consists of a fallopian tube which measures 25mm in length with a maximum diameter of 7mm.  There is attached ovary which measures 25 x 17 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 - LS of the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube; 2 - TS distal half offallopian tube; 3 - TS proximal half of fallopian tube; 4 to 7 - ovary AE.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic cyst wall", consists of an opened and collapsed cyst which measures 60 x 50 x 15mm.  The cyst is uniloculated with a wall thickness of 1mm.  No solid or papillary areas seen.  In some areas the cyst wall appears slightly roughened, these areas constitute approximately 5% of the total cyst area.  Representative sections in 4 blocks.
(GQ/vo 3.9.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Mccaslin & Dr J Stoneburner)
A.  Sections show benign fallopian tube and ovary. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
B.  Sections show fragments of thickened, dense fibrous tissue, possibly representing the wall of a cystic structure, with some overlying mature adipose and lymphoid tissue. Some overlying mesothelium is also present. The inner surface of the fibrous tissue lacks a true epithelial lining. There is a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate within the wall. The appearance may represent an area of fibrosis surrounding a previous site of surgery, organising haemorrhage, or possibly, membranous fat necrosis. Thereis no evidence of malignancy in the sections examined. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right fallopian tube and ovary: No significant abnormality.

B.  Left pelvic cyst wall: Benign dense fibrous tissue with no true epithelial lining (see body of report).
