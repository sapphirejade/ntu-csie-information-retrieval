CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot; Uterus tubes ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tube, and ovaries, weighing 92g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 65 x 55mm and has a smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 26mm and has an unremarkable surface. On sectioning, the endometrium is mainly 1mm in thickness apart from a patchy area in the left cornu, 22 x 10mm, where the endometrial thickness is 2 to 3mm.  Towards the posterior right cornu there is an endometrial polyp, 17 x 12 x 5mm.  The myometrium measures up to 30mm in thickness.  The myometrium has a few scattered fibroids measuring up to 5mm in maximum dimension.  The left fallopian tube, 65 x 7 x 7mm, is unremarkable, and the left ovary, 27 x 17 x 11mm, has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube, 70 x 8 x 9mm, is unremarkable and the right ovary, 34 x 16 x 8mm, has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 5 - midline LS post uterus and cervix, including thickened endometrium; 6 &amp;amp; 8 - remaining thickened endometrium (all embedded); 9 - complete endometrial polyp; 10 - polyp attachment site (detached during sectioning); 11 to 15 - midline LS anterior uterus and cervix; 16 - representative anterior fibroid; 17 - LS complete fimbrial end left fallopian tube, and mid TS; 18 - representative left ovary; 19 - LS complete fimbrial end right fallopian tube, and mid TS; 20 - representative right ovary.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right pelvic nodes&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 24 x 18 x 4mm, containing possible lymph nodes.  AE 1 block.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of omental tissue, 42 x 25 x 10mm.  No nodules or lymph nodes are identified.  RS 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Bethard):
A.  Sections of the described area of thickened endometrium towards the left cornu, and of the anterior fundus, show complex hyperplasia and grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  There is no definite myometrial invasion.  There is no lymphovascular invasion and there is no cervical involvement.
Sections of the described endometrial polyp in the right cornu show that this is benign.
The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.
Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.
A leiomyoma and adenomyosis are confirmed in the myometrium.
Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.

C.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:
1.  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, no definite myometrial invasion.
2.  Endometrial polyp.
3.  Leiomyoma and adenomyosis.

B.  Right pelvic nodes:  No tumour (0/2).

C.  Omental biopsy:  No tumour.


SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (16.4.67):
Stains for mismatch repair enzymes have been performed as requested.

MLH1:   Loss of nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Loss of nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.

Absence (loss) of nuclear staining of a carcinoma for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
