Adenocarcinoma - endocervical vs endometrial ?.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Bilateral tubes and ovaries, uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 450g in total. The uterus measures 115 x 110 x 60mm and has asmooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm.  The vaginal cuff extends distally up to 20mm posteriorly and 10mm anteriorly.  On sectioning the endometrium is thickened and has a roughened surface consistent with a tumour.  The tumour is approximately 88 x 95 x 12mm.  The deepest penetration of tumour (12mm) is seen in the lower segment and upper cervix. There are five to six myometrial nodules, all with whorled grey cut surfaces, the largest of which is 58 x 55 x 52mm.   The right fallopian tube measures 52mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter. The right ovary measures 25 x 12 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 52mm in length and up to 6mm in maximum diameter. The left ovary measures 22 x 12 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Block 1 - posterior vaginal cuff shave margin (in two sections); 2-9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (4 & 5, 6 & 7 - paired sections); 10-19 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (12 & 13, 14 & 15, 16 & 17, 18 & 19 - paired sections); 20-22 - sections of anterior cervix including the vaginal cuff (block 20 for tumour bank); 23 -  anterior cervix and vaginal cuff; 24 - right fallopian tube and ovary; 25 - left fallopian tube and ovary; 26 - section from posterior body of cervix. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 82 x 35 x 12mm.  There are several lymph nodes within the specimen. All are embedded.  Block 1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - one trisected lymph node; 3 - three lymph nodes; 4 & 5 - one lymph node; 6 - one bisected node; 7 - one lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator nodes", consists of fragments of fibrofatty tissue 55 x 42 x 15mm in aggregate.  There are four lymph nodes within the specimen. 
Block 1 - four lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 17 x 12mm.  There are two lymph nodes.  Block 1- one bisected node; 2 - one bisected node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac nodes", consists of fragments of fibrofatty tissue 65 x 45 x 25mm in aggregate.  There are several lymph nodes within the specimen.  Blocks 1 & 2- one lymph node; 3 - one bisected lymph node; 4 - one bisected lymph node; 5 - three lymphnodes; 6 - two lymph nodes.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 25 x 12mm.There are three lymph nodes.  Block 1- three lymph nodes.  
G. Specimen labelled "Right common iliac nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 45 x 35 x 14mm.  There are several lymph nodes within the specimen.  
Block 1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one bisected lymph node.   (XT/ec  28.6.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Dumaine)
A.  Sections showa poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma favoured as a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomna of the endometrium.  The tumour is very extensive and has a maximum depth of invasion of 15mm through a wall 17mm thick.  Extensive ectocervical and endocervical stromal involvement is present with a maximum depth of invasion of 11mm through a wall 13mm thick.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is seen.
Small areas of more typical grade 1 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma and hyperplasia are noted.  There is no VAIN, CIN or AIS.
Tumour extends to within 10mm of the vaginal cuff anteriorly.  
Several leiomyomas are noted.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  One of eight lymph nodes shows a tiny 0.5mm focus of metastatic carcinoma.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 15mm through a wall 17mm thick.  Extensive ectocervical and endocervical stromal involvement is present.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is present.  1 of 29 lymph nodes shows a 0.5mm focus of metastatic carcinoma.
