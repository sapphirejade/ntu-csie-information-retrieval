CLINICAL:
Likely SCC clitoris.  Hysterectomy + BSO.  IHD, angina.  Hypertension.  Anterior vulvectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Marking stitch at 12 o'clock, anterior vulva" consists of an oriented triangular shape of skin including clitoris 85 x 65 x 50mm.  There is a suture at one end (12 o'clock).  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock margin black.  There are two linear scars on the right and left of the clitoris.  The right measures 45mm in length and the left measures 44mm in length.  The clitoris has a solid tan nodule measuring 4 x 4 x 3mm on the left lateral area.  Otherwise the skin appears unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1- one LS 12 o'clock; 2 & 3, 4 & 5, 6 & 7, 8 & 9 - one TS 3 to 9 o'clock anterior to clitoris; 10 to 26 - one LS from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock (block 17, 18, 19 - midline clitoris).  
B.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulvafat" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 42 x 20 x 10mm.  No lymph nodes identified within the fat.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 5 blocks.  (GH/mm 20.2.63)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr N Flintroy):
A.  Sections of vulval skin show tongues of well differentiated keratinising squamous epithelium invading the dermis with a pushing border consistent with a verrucous carcinoma.  Background changes of lichen sclerosis with reactive squamous atypia are present.  Adjacent to the tumour the epithelium shows a small amount of differentiated VIN.  The carcinoma invades to a depth of 3mm comingto within 10mm of the deep resection margin.  The tumour is situated towards the 6 o'clock end of the specimen and has a width of 6mm and lies 4mm from the 6 o'clock resection margin.  No perineural or lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Differentiated VIN comes to within 9mm of the 6 o'clock margin.  All other margins are well clear of invasive and in situ carcinoma. 
B.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Anterior vulva:
- Verrucous carcinoma, margins clear. 
- Small amount of differentiated VIN, margins clear
- Background lichen sclerosis.
