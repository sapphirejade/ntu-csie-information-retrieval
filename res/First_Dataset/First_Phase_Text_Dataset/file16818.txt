CLINICAL:
Adnexal mass with normal CA125.  Right ovarian cyst.  IB2 SCC of cervix.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of a cystic ovary, 110 x 95 x 80mm, with attached fallopian tube 55mm long and 6 to 11mm in diameter.  The outer surface of the cyst is smooth.  The cyst is unilocular and contains thin clear fluid.  There are focal thickened areas, up to 15mm across; otherwise the inner lining is smooth.
Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2 - FS thickened areas; 3 - fallopian tube; 4 - TS ? fallopian tube and adjacent cyst; 5 - dilated fallopian tube; 6-15 - RS cyst.

FROZEN SECTION RESULT:

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus/cervix&amp;#8220;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, weighing 91g in total.  The uterus measures 95 x 60 x 40mm.  The anterior margin is inked blue and posterior black.  The ectocervix measures 55 x 45mm.  The cervical os is up to 37mm in diameter.  The cervix is expanded by a solid friable tumour involving both anterior and posterior cervix in a near circumferential manner, 95 x 50mm in surface dimensions.  On slicing the tumour is 18mm in maximum thickness and is less than 1mm from the radial resection margin.  The endometrium is 1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 18mm in thickness.  No myometrial lesions are seen.
Block 1-18 - anterior cervix blocked from 9 towards 3 o&amp;apos;clock (from block 3-18 each of the two successive blocks are paired); 19-41 - posterior cervix blocked from 3 towards 9 o&amp;apos;clock (from block 21-23 each of the two successive blocks are paired, from block 24-38 each of the three successive blocks are continuous; 39 &amp;amp; 40 - paired); 42 - tumour with no margin, reserve block; 43 &amp;amp; 44 - anterior uterine body; 45 &amp;amp; 46 - posterior uterine body.  Please see the diagram.  Cervix AE.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Posterior vaginal margin&amp;#8220;, consists of an piece of mucosa, 35 x 7 x 7mm.  The non-mucosal surface is inked black and opposite surface blue.  Sequentially blocked in 8 blocks.  AE.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left ovary and tube&amp;#8220;, consists of an ovary, 20 x 20 x 15mm, with parametrial soft tissue (30 x 15 x 5mm) and an oedematous fallopian tube 65mm long and up to 13mm in diameter.  On slicing there is a relatively well defined pale solid 6mm area within the ovary.  A focal lesion is not seen within the fallopian tube. There is an 8mm paratubal cyst.
Block 1- ovary, including solid area; 2 &amp;amp; 3- fallopian tube (3 - includes cyst).

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left external iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of fragments of adipose tissue, 50 x 45 x 8mm in aggregate.  One lymph node is identified, 10mm.  Block 1- one lymph node.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;External iliac lymph node 2&amp;#8220;, consists of adipose tissue, 30 x 25 x 8mm in aggregate.  One lymph node is identified, 22mm.  Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right external iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of fragments of adipose tissue, 75 x 65 x 10mm in aggregate.  No definite lymph node is identified.  AE 12 blocks.

H.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right external iliac lymph node no 2&amp;#8220;, consists of adipose tissue, 35 x 22 x 6mm in aggregate.  There is one lymph node, 25mm.  Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node.

I.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left obturator lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of adipose tissue, 35 x 25 x 6mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified, 16 and 22mm.  Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node each block.

J.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right obturator lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of one lymph node, 20 x 10 x 6mm, and separate fragments of fatty tissue, 25 x 20 x 5mm in aggregate.  Block 1 - one lymph node.

K.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omental biopsy&amp;#8220;, consists of omental tissue, 120 x 75 x 25mm.  No nodules are seen.  RS 3 blocks.   (TO: HM/ec   1.5.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Poellnitz):
A.  The right ovarian cyst is lined by simple cuboidal to ciliated tubal epithelium overlying a dense fibrous wall, consistent with a benign serous cystadenoma.  The fallopian tube is dilated with minimal chronic inflammation in the plicae, consistent with hydrosalpinx.  Incidental endosalpingiosis is seen over the ovarian serosa.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  The sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.  The tumour is composed of solid nests and papillform patterns of malignant squamoid cells with scattered markedly bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei.  The tumour shows essentially circumferential involvement of the cervix.  The tumour length is 45mm and the estimated width is 40mm.  The tumour has a maximum thickness of 17mm invading through a posterior wall 19mm thick (B31).  In a separate area on the anterior wall the tumour is 1mm clear of the closest radial cervical margin (B16).  Multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion is present.  The carcinoma is 4mm from the closest vaginal margin.  Adjacent changes of CIN 3 are present, and this is clear of the vaginal margin.  The endometrium is inactive.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are seen in the paracervical soft tissue.

C.  The sections of the posterior vaginal margin show ulcerated squamous epithelium and underlying stroma.  There is chronic inflammation underlying the ulcer.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

D.  The left ovary contains incidental stromal hyperplasia and surface epithelial inclusion glands.  The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

E.  The sections show one negative lymph node (0/1).  There is no evidence of malignancy.

F.  The sections show one negative lymph node (0/1).  There is no evidence of malignancy.

G.  The sections show adipose tissue.  The entire specimen has been embedded and no lymph node is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

H.  The sections show one negative lymph node (0/1) with incidental endosalpingiosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

I.  The sections show two negative lymph nodes (0/2).  There is no evidence of malignancy.

J.  The sections show one negative lymph node (0/1).  There is no evidence of malignancy.

K.  The sections of omentum show an incidental focus of endosalpingiosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
