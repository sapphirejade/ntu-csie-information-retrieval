CLINICAL:
DCIS right breast re-excision of cavity.  Short superior, long lateral, medium medial.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of an orientated right local excision with three sutures in situ as designated measuring 60mm (medial to lateral) x 40mm (inferior to superior) x 23mm (superficial to deep).  The superior margin is inked blue, the inferior/superficial margin is inked green and the deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the parasagittal plane into 10 slices from slice 1 lateral to slice 10 medial.  Heterogenous tan cream and fatty tissue is identified in the cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - slice 1; 3 - slice 2; 4 - slice 3; 5 - slice 4; 6 & 7 - slice 5; 8 & 9 - slice 6; 10 & 11 - slice 7;12 & 13 - slice 8; 14 & 15 - slice 9; 16 & 17 - slice 10.  AE.  Please refer to attached diagram.  (KH/mm 17.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Celmer):  
Sections show scar tissue with fibrosis, fat necrosis and foreign body reaction, in keepingwith previous surgery.  At the periphery of scar tissue, there are two small foci of residual ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) each measuring 1.5mm in diameter (block3 and 4).  The DCIS shows intermediated grade nuclei with cribriform and papillary architecture.  Calcification and necrosis are present.  The resection margins are clear.  The DCIS is 1.2mm to the deep margin (block 4) and is 3.5mm to superior margin (block 3).  Intervening normal breast ducts are present.  The other margins are well clear.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast lesion - Residual DCIS.
