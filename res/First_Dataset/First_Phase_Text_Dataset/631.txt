CLINICAL:
Hx of SCC vulva.  VAIN 3, CIN 3.  Vulvar cancer, CIN 3.  
1.  Vaginal angle.
2.  Anterior vaginal wall (stitch distal margin).
3.  Right posterior vagina.
4.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries.
5.  Right vulva (marker at 12 o'clock).  
6.  Upper vaginal margin.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 80g in total.  The uterus has a smooth shiny serosal surface and measures 70 x 50 x 30mm.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Surgical margin is inked black.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness over a total wall thickness of 13mm.  The myometrium contains one fibroid measuring 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right fallopian tube is received in two pieces measuring 60mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 35 x 20 x 20mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is received in two pieces measuring 60mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 50 x 20 x 17mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 9 - LS of anterior cervix from right to left AE; 10 to 23 - LS of the posterior cervix from left to right AE; 24 & 25 - full LS through anterior body;26 & 27 - full LS through posterior body; 28 - representative fibroid; 29 - two LS of fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube; 30 - two representative TS right fallopian tube; 31 - two representative TS right ovary; 32 - two LS fimbrial end of left fallopian tube; 33 - two TS representative TS left fallopian tube; 34 - two representative TS left ovary.   (Please refer to attached diagram).  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right vaginal angle" consists of two pieces of fibrous tissue measuring 12 and 13mm.  Larger piece bisected.   AE 1 block.   
C.  Specimen labelled "Upper vaginal margin" consists of an unoriented ellipse of mucosa measuring 40 x 10mm to a depth of 8mm.  Surgical margin is inked black.  Serially TSand AE.  
Blocks: 1 - two TS ends; 2 to 4 - TS mid.
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right posterior vagina" consists of a semicircular excision of mucosa measuring 30 x 10mm to a depth of 7mm.  Surgical margin inked black.  Specimen is serially TS and AE.  
Blocks: 1 - two TS of ends; 2 to 4 - TSmid.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vaginal wall stitch distal margin" consists of an irregular excision of mucosa covered tissue measuring 55 x 25mm to a depth of 5mm.  There is a stitch in situ to mark the distal margin; this stitch is designated as 12 o'clock.  12 o'clock inked blue, 6 o'clock inked black. Specimen is serially sectioned from 3 to 9 o'clock.  AE 16 blocks.  (Please refer to attached diagram).  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Right vulva (marker at 12 o'clock)" consists of an irregular excision of skin and subcutaneous tissue measuring 55 x 30mm to a depth of 20mm in total.  The skin measures 25 x 15mm.  3 o'clock is inked blue, 9 o'clock inked black.Specimen is serially TS from 12 to 6 o'clock and AE 11 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Siebers): 
A.  The entire cervix has been blocked.  The transformation zone is seen.  There is high grade squamous dysplasia (CIN 3) over a broadfront.  There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma or glandular neoplasia.  The cervical mucosa is partly denuded but changes of CIN 3 appear to extend to the ectocervical excision margin.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  A benign leiomyoma is seen.  A section of the right ovary shows multiple benign inclusion cysts.  Sections of the fallopian tubes and left ovary showno significant abnormality.  A left paratubal cyst is also noted.
B.  Sections show vascular fibroadipose tissue.  No intact epithelium is seen but there is some distorted, detached epithelium present and this shows features of VAIN 3.   
C.  Sections show mainly skin, including epidermis and dermis with skin appendage structures, but also some squamous mucosa.  There is no dysplasia.
D.  Sections show squamous epithelium and underlying fibrous stroma.  Some of the epithelium is denuded and some is attenuated.  There is an area of high grade squamous dysplasia (VAIN 3) and this extends to one end margin of the specimen.
E.  Sections show stratified squamous epithelium with underlying tissue.  Most of the epithelium shows features of VAIN 3.  The high grade squamous dysplasia extends to part of the distal margin and to both side excision margins.  It probably also extends to the proximal margin. 
F.  Sections show skin and squamous mucosa with underlying tissue.  The entire specimen has been blocked.  There is no evidence of squamousdysplasia or invasive carcinoma.  Suture material from previous surgery is noted in the subepithelial tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries:
1.  CIN 3
2.  Uterine leiomyoma
B.  Right vaginal angle:  Detached epithelium showing VAIN 3.
C.  Upper vaginal margin:  Skin and squamous mucosa showing no abnormality.
D.  Right posterior vagina:  VAIN 3.
E.  Anterior vaginal wall:  VAIN 3.
F.  Right vulva:  Nosignificant abnormality.
