***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.1.2062): MICROSATELLITE MARKERS

CLINICAL:
Transverse colon tumour.  Right extended hemicolectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right extended hemicolectomy" consists of a hemicolectomy which was received opened at the distal end measuring 240mm in length with a length of terminal ileum 120mm in length.  Anappendix is not identified in the specimen.  32mm from the distal resection margin is a sessile tan tumour measuring 25 x 23mm and occupies approximately 40% or the circumference of the colon.  The tumour appears to invade to maximum depth of 4mm and appears to enter the muscularis propria but does not penetrate through it.  A 6mm pedunculated polyp is identified within the caecum.  The polyp appears confined to the mucosa.  Two 2mm polypoid areas are identified in theterminal ileum just adjacent to the ileocaecal valve.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 2 to 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 - resection margin; 2 to 4 - tumour to deepest point of invasion; 5 - colonic polyp; 6 - uninvolved colonic mucosa; 7 - polypoid region of terminal ileum; 8 - apical node; 9 to 11 - lymph nodes; 12 - one lymph node bisected; 13 - lymph nodes.  (SVc/ta  23/1/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Kracht - 24.1.2062)
The transverse colon tumour is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for colorectal carcinoma follows:
