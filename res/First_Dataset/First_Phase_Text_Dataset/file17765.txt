MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of adnexal tissue 40 x 30 x 23mm. A fimbrial end of a fallopian tube is identified within distorted tan tissue with serosal haemorrhage and adhesions. Possible ovarian tissue is seen on sectioning. Blocks: 1 - LS fimbrial end and possible isthmus; 2 to 4 - RS through ?ovarian tissue.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of adnexal tissue 43 x 40 x 20mm. No definite fimbrial end of tube or ovary is identified externally. On sectioning a 15mm cavity is identified with a 10mm wall. Possible fimbriae are identified within the cavity. RS 4 blocks.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Small bowel serosa&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of irregular tan tissue 7 x 5 x 3mm. AE 1 block.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Bowel adhesion&amp;quot;, consists of strips of pale fibrous tissue 15 x 5 x 2mm in aggregate. AE 1 block.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental nodule biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of omental type fat 55 x 28 x 15mm. There is vague nodular distortion which on sectioning shows a necrotic cyst containing inspissated cheese like debris. No solid areas are identified. RS 3 blocks. (TO:AP/vo 29/3/71)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Stanchfield):
A &amp;amp; B.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving predominantly the right ovary, also involving the left ovary, paradnexal soft tissues, and fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube.
No STIC is seen.

B &amp;amp; C.  Sections show adhesions.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

D.  Sections show predominantly fat necrosis and old haemorrhage.  In addition, there are several tiny deposits of high grade serous carcinoma.

Chemotherapy Response Score (CRS)
Score 2:  Partial tumour response


DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of the right ovary, also involving the left ovary, fimbrial end of the right tube, paradnexal soft tissues, and omentum.
