CLINICAL:
Total gastrectomy for gastric Ca.  ?Gastric malignancy and ACS.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled&amp;quot;Stomach (fresh)&amp;quot; consists of a total gastrectomy including distal portion of oesophagus measuring in total 200 x 100 x 30mm.  The lesser curve measures approximately 150mm in length and the greater curve 240mm.  The omentum is attached to the greater curvature and measures 250 x 240 x 30mm.  The oesophageal margin is inked black and the antrum blue.  On the anterior serosal surface there is a white area with puckering of the serosal surface over 30 x 20mm.  The lesser omentum measures 170 x 70 x 20mm.  On opening there is a large fungating tumour close to the oesophageal gastric junction over 70 x 70mm predominantly on the anterior surface of the stomach and lesser curve.  The epicentre of the tumour is 30mm from cardioesophageal junction.  The portion of oesophagus received measures 20mm in length x 40mm in open diameter.  The tumour is 20mm to the oesophageal resection margin.  The tumour abuts the serosal surface.  The tumour is 115mm from the antral surgical margin.  The rest of the stomach appears unremarkable.  The tumour appears to invade into the lesser omentum with a deposit of tumour found at the external surface measuring 10mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are found within the lesser and greater omentum.
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - oesophageal margin and closest tumour; 3 to 8 - tumour with blocks 7&amp;amp;8 showing depth of invasioninto the lesser omentum; 9 - antrum away from tumour; 10 - distal antral margin; 11- infiltrating tumour in the lesser curvature; 12 to 19 - lymph nodes from lesser curve (12&amp;amp;13 - one lymph node each; 14 to 19 - lymph nodes as seen); 20 to 25 - lymph nodes from greater curvature, lymph nodes as seen; 26 - tumour for bio-banking.
