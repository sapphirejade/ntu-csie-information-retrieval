Previous likely very early peritoneal cancer.  Now rising Ca 125.  Washings from diagnostic laparoscopy with low grade serous.  Possible early peritoneal cancer 2058.  TAH fibroid uterus.  BSO 2058.  2 x LSCS.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum nodule&amp;quot; consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 10 x 5mm.   AE for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#8211; frozen section.
Adenocarcinoma consistent with serous carcinoma.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Result to Dr Yanofsky by Dr M Azar and Dr M Hedley at 17:05 on 16/7/14.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Small bowel mesentery&amp;quot; consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 8 x 5 x 4mm.  AE for frozen section in 1 block.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma consistent with serous carcinoma.
Result to Dr Sheffield by Dr M Blankinship and Dr M Pihlaja at 17:05 on 16/7/14.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Peritoneal adhesion&amp;quot; consists of a 5mm biopsy.   AE 1 block.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Liver biopsy&amp;quot; consists of four fragments of core biopsy measuring 5 to 10mm.   AE 1 block.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Falciform ligament&amp;quot; consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 40 x 20mm with a nodular and friable area measuring 20 x 10mm.
Blocks: 1 to 3 &amp;#8211; nodular and friable area AE; 4 &amp;#8211; other areas.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot; consists of a large piece of omentum measuring 350 x 150 x 40mm.  On sectioning there are small white fibrous areas, however no discrete mass is identified.  Representative sections in 15 blocks.   (PG/ta 19/9/64)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Lueder):
The previous report 42X83389 is noted with interest.

A &amp;amp; F.  Sections show low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma extensively involving the omentum.  The tumour has a predominant micropapillary pattern and is associated with scattered psammoma bodies and desmoplasia, and displays  haphazard infiltrative growth.  Moderate nuclear atypia is noted.

B, C &amp;amp; E.  Sections show smaller foci of low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma.

D.  Sections show a fatty liver.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma of peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, and also involving the small bowel mesentery, peritoneum and falciform ligament.


ADDITIONAL REPORT 26/9/64:
The tumour is strongly and diffusely positive for ER and focally positive for PR.
