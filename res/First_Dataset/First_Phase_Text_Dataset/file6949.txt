C. &amp;quot;STOMACH, SPLEEN, DISTAL PANCREAS, BILATERAL OVARIES, OMENTUM&amp;quot;. Received a gastrectomy specimen containing part of the oesophagus (measuring 8mm in length) and part of the pylorus. The lesser curvature measures 90mm in length and the greater curvature measures 175mm. The lesser omentum measures 90x50x25mm and the greater omentum measuring 225x220x10mm. Attached en-block also a spleen measuring 90x55x45mm and distal pancreas 35x35x10mm with a staple line at one end measuring  50mm.
Two separate tumour foci are identified. The first is a solid tumour at the junction of the body and the fundus at the greater curvature, measuring  30x25mm that is polypoid and with mucosal irregularity and thickening measuring 80x60mm. The tumour invades through the wall to involve the overlying serosal surface which is firm and white with an adherent piece of greater omentum.

Tumour focus number 2 is located more distally at the junction of body and antrum measuring  27x20mm and located 90mm distal to the polpoid part of tumour number 1. Tumour 2 invades through the wall to involve the overlying nodular serosal surface. The braod mucosal irregularity of tumour 1 is located 20mm of the proximal margin. Tumour 2 is located 55mm of the distal margin.

The splenic surface is unremarkable. The cut surface is unremarkable. The anterior pancreatic surface is inked blue, posterior black and resection margin is inked red. The cut surface is unremarkable. The omentum cut surface reveals no definite tumours. Received separately are 2 uterine adnexae.

Macroscopic synoptic:

Type of resection: En-block Total gastrectomy with omentum, spleen and distal pancreas
received separately bilateral ovaries and umbilicus.

Specimen dimensions:
Length of stomach greater curve: 90 mm
Length of stomach lesser curve: 175mm
Length of oesophagus: 8 mm
Length of duodenum: 25 mm
Macroscopic tumour site (location/s):
Cardia, Fundus, Antrum, Body, Pylorus , Greater curve, Lesser curve , Anterior wall

Maximum tumour diameter:  Two tumour foci 90 mm apart; tumour one consists of an area of mucosal irregularity 80mm in diameter with a central nodule 30mm; and tumour two measures 27mm.

Macroscopic tumour type:  Advanced gastric cancer (pT4), Type IV Infiltrative

Distance from tumour to nearest proximal or distal margin (cut end): 20 mm (distal)
Distance from tumour to the circumferential resection margin (proximal/cardia tumours):  more than 30 mm

Serosal appearance: Firm white and nodular (macroscopically involved)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Z Armson)
A.  Sections show squamous mucosa and underlying submucosa and muscularis propria. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show fragments of apparently subcapsular liver with fibrosis and chronic inflammation without fibrous tissue and bile ducts within fibrous tissue.  Negative for malignancy.
C.  Sections of both macroscopically identified tumour masses have similar morrphology.  The appearances are those of diffuse type gastric carcinoma (poorly cohesive carcinoma) including signet ring cells. There is a wide variation in the morphology of tumour cells including some with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, some with vacuolated cytoplasm and some with targetoid intracytoplasmic inclusions. In addition there are foci of squamous differentiation identified including rare intercellular bridges and these are positive for CK5/6 and p-40. The squamous differentiation form less than 25% of the tumour volume (and hence does not fulfil criteria given by some authors for a diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma). The diffuse gastric carcinoma is positive for CK20 (strong diffuse), focal CK7, and strong diffuse E-cadherin.
There is prominent lymphatic vascular space invasion.
Both macroscopic tumour masses  involve the full thickness of the gastric wall to reach the adjacent serosa and with infiltration of the immediately adjacent greater omentum.  Sections of the stomach in between the two main tumour masses show lymphatic permeation by carcinoma as well as deposits of infiltrative carcinoma within the submucosa.  It is likely that one of the macroscopic tumour masses represents intragastric spread of the other tumour.
Carcinoma is 12mm from the proximal resection margin and is not seen in the sections from the distal resection margin.
There is patchy chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Giemsa stain is negative for Helicobacter. No intestinal metaplasia is seen in the sections examined.
8 of 8 lesser curve lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
8 of 8 greater curve lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
4 of 4 splenic hilar lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
Sections of the spleen are unremarkable and sections of the pancreas are unremarkable.
Sections of the fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.  Sections of the separate pieces of peritoneum are unremarkable.
D.  The sections show squamous mucosa and small intestinal mucosa and underlying muscularis propria.  Negative for malignant cells.
E.  The sections show skin with underlying fibrofatty tissue and shows fibroblastic reaction, birefringent foreign material and fibroblastic reaction and patchy chronic inflammation consistent with effects of previous surgery.  Negative for malignancy.
