There is a stitch at one tip designated anterior, 12 o&amp;apos;clock.  On the surface of the skin there is an ulcerated nodular lesion appr oximately 30mm in maximum dimension.  The 3 o&amp;#8217;clock edge is inked blue and the 9 o&amp;#8217;clock black.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 13 blocks (blocks from cf112 o&amp;apos;clock to 6 o&amp;#8217;clock;ngnp3081 13 - is extra fat at the 6 o&amp;#8217;clock margin).

9 o&amp;#8217;clock margi n and is well clear of the 12 and 6 o&amp;#8217;clock margins.  No lymphvascular or perineural invasion is seen.  There is a background of lichen sclerosis.  No convincing VIN is seen.
B.  Sections show a benign proliferation of smooth muscle and nerves in the deep dermis and subcutis.  5677 There is no evidence of VIN or malignancy.
