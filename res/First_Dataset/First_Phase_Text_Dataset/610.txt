CLINICAL:
47yo woman with family history of ovarian cancer.  1.  Uterus, cervix, ovaries.  2.  Labia minora punch biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries" consistsof a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 187g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 70 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning in the endocervix there are multiple nabothian cysts up to 13mm diameter.  On sectioning the endometrium is1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 35mm in maximum thickness.   The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length x 7mm in maximum diameter.   The left ovary measures 35 x 20 x 15mm.  Both ovarieshave small cysts up to 15mm diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 - further representative section of the posterior uterus; 11 - right fallopian tube and fimbriae; 12 - representative sections right ovary; 13 - left fallopian tube and fimbriae; 14 to 17 - representative section left ovary. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left labia minora" consists of a 4mm punch biopsy.   AE 1 block.  (RO/ta 7/4/63) 
  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Gilsdorf):
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is in late secretory phase. The myometrium is unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  Sections of the ovaries show small simple cysts and occasional cystic follicles but the ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  
B.   Sections show stratified squamous epithelium with underlying tissue.  There is mild hyperkeratosis and there is some increased pigmentation of basal cells, with pigment incontinence. The features are consistent with vulval melanosis.  There is no dysplasia.  There is no melanocyte proliferation.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  No significant abnormality.
B.   Biopsy left labia minora:  Melanosis.
