CLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma right ovary.  TAHBSO 24/5/2063 staging.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovary & pedicle" consists of a piece peritoneum and fat measuring 70 x 50 x 20mm.  On sectioning thick glistening areas are identified measuring up to 7mm.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left ovarian pedicle" consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue, unorientated measuring 30 x 15mm.  On sectioning the cut surface is fibrotic.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of two large lymph nodes 10 and 15mm and a piece of fatty tissue 15 x 10 x 10mm.  The lymph nodes are embedded.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of three lymph nodes 5, 7 and 10mm. 
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2- two lymph nodes.  AE.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of one lymph node 7 mm in maximum diameter EA 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right paracaval lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue containing two lymph nodes 7 and 15mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks:  1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - one lymph node.
.  Specimen labelled "Para-aortic lymph node" consistsof three lymph nodes 2, 2 and 15mm and a piece of fatty tissue.  
Blocks:  1- two lymph nodes and fatty tissue; 2- one bisected lymph node.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Suprapubic port site lymph node" consists of two irregular pieces of fibrous tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm and 15 x 20 x 10mm.  AE 3 blocks.  
I.  Specimen labelled "Vaginal wall small bowel biopsy" consists of two biopsies 5 and 7mm.  AE 1 block.
J.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel lesion" consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue 10 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
K.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omentum measuring 350 x 300 x 20mm.  No macroscopic lesions are identified.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (TO: PL: ST/mm 8.7.63) 


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Yasika):
A.  Sections show fibrofat and smooth muscle with suture material and an associated giant cell reaction from previous surgery.  Also present is an area of residual grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  This measures 10mm diameter in the section.  Tumour extends close to the peritoneal surface and to excision margins showing diathermy artefact.
B.  Sections show fibrofat and smooth muscle with patchy suture material from previous surgery.  No tumour is seen.  
C.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
D.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
E.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.  
F.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
G.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
H.  Sections show pieces of fibrofat, smooth muscle and skeletal muscle.  There is some fat necrosis and there is a patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells.  No lymph node is seen.  No tumour isseen. 
I.  Sections show pieces of fibrous and fibroblastic tissue with a moderate, patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells.  Suture material with a giant cell reaction, from previous surgery, is also noted.  No tumour is seen.  
J.  The sections show fibrofat and smooth muscle with suture material, and associated giant cell reaction, from previous surgery.  No tumour is seen.  
K.  Sections show unremarkable fat and two small lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right ovarian pedicle:  Residual grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  
B.  Leftovarian pedicle:  No tumour.  
C.  Right pelvic lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
D.  Left pelvic lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
E.  Right obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).  
F.  Rightparacaval lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
G.  Para-aortic lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
H.  Suprapubic port site tissue:   No tumour.  
I.  Vaginal wall small bowel biopsy:  No tumour. 
J.  Small bowel lesion:  No tumour.   
K.  Omentum:  No tumour (0/2).
