The cut surface of the uterus shows one small foci of whirling ( fibroid) measuring up to 6mm.   The cut surface of the adherent mass shows infiltration into the myometrium
The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with an outer diameter of 7mm.  Towards the fimbrial end is a nodular lesion measuring 10 x 8 x 6mm.  The cut surface of the nodule is uniformly tan.
The ovary measures 20 x 15 x 8mm. The cut surface of the ovary is in unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 4 &amp;#8211; anterior of uterus (block 1 anterior cervix; 2&amp;#8211; isthmus; 3 and 4 &amp;#8211; endometrium + myometrium); 5 to 8 &amp;#8211; posterior (block 5 &amp;#8211; posterior cervix plus adherent mass, 6 &amp;#8211; isthmus with adherent mass; 7 and 8 &amp;#8211; endometrium + myometrium); 9 and 10 &amp;#8211; further section shower adherent mass ectocervix; 11 &amp;#8211; two RS of fibroid; 12 &amp;#8211; fimbrial end with nodule; 13 and 14 &amp;#8211; reminder of fallopian tube; 15 and 16 &amp;#8211; ovary.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right pelvic wall nodule&amp;quot;, consists of a pale tan brown tissue measuring 30 x 15 x 10mm and sliced into six slices.  The cut surface is solid, pale and tan.  AE 3 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Rectal nodule&amp;quot;, consists of four piece of pearl tan brown tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 8mm.  AE 2 blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Small bowel nodule&amp;quot;, consists of a single pale tan brown tissue measuring 10 x 5 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Splenic flexure nodule 2&amp;quot;, consists of a tan brown tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 10mm.  It has been sliced into five slices.The cut surface shows a solid pale tan brown surface.  AE 2 blocks.
H.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Splenic flexure nodule&amp;quot;, consists of a tan brown tissue with surrounding fat measuring 80 x 50 x 30mm.  The cut surface shows solid pale tan brown areas with haemorrhagic areas.  Representative sections in blocks 1 to 8.
I.  Specimen labelled&amp;quot;Spleen&amp;quot;, consists of a spleen measuring 80 x 60 x 20mm.  The cut surface shows uniform red brown parenchyma.  No focal lesions seen.
RS in 3 blocks.
J.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of fat with three nodules measuring 160 x 80 x 20mm.  The nodules measures from 15 to 50mm in maximum dimension.  The cut surface of each nodule is solid soft pale tan.  The rest of the fat is uniformly fatty.  Representative sections from each nodule embeddedfrom 1 to 3; block 4 RS of fatty tissue.  (TO: LM;LM/vo 5.5.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Pevahouse):
A. Sections show a 55mm high grade serous carcinoma replacing the right ovary.  The lesion has a solid and papillary architecture, and is composed of tumour cells with enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Slit-likespaces and multinucleated tumour giant cells are seen.
Deposits of carcinoma are present on the right fallopian tube fimbria, and on the surface of the right ovary and right fallopian tube.
The right fallopian tube shows no evidence of in situ carcinoma.
B. Sections show omental fat with extensive involvement by high grade serous carcinoma.
C. Sections show high grade serous carcinoma attached to the posterior cervix andon the fimbria of the left fallopian tube.
The left ovary shows no evidence malignancy.
There is no evidence of carcinoma in situ in the left fallopian tube.
Benign leiomyomas are present. The endometrium is inactive.  The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN.
D to H, J. Sections show high grade serous carcinoma.
I.  Sections show spleen with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A to H, J. Right adnexal mass and fallopian tube, omental nodule, uterus with cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary, right pelvic wall nodule, rectal nodule, small bowel nodule, splenic flexure nodules 1 and 2:
- 55mm high grade serous carcinoma of the right ovary
- Metastatic carcinoma involving both fallopian tubes, omentum, posterior cervix,right pelvic wall, rectum, small bowel and splenic flexure
I. Spleen: no evidence of malignancy
AMENDED REPORT (14/5/65)
The case was discussed at the gynae-oncology MDT. The right ovary (of normal size) was noted to be separate to the adnexal mass at surgery. MSI immunohistochemistry also requested.
MACROSCOPIC
Specimen A (right adnexal mass, tube and ovary) wasre-examined. Separate from the adnexal mass is an ovary measuring 25 x 20 x 10mm. This has been entirely embedded in block A13 to 15.
MICROSCOPIC
Sections of the right ovary show a 15mm deposit of high grade serous carcinoma in the parenchyma of the right ovary.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
COMMENT
The right ovary, which was of normal size, contained a 15mm deposit of high grade serous carcinoma in the parenchyma. In view of the bulk of the tumour being outside the right ovary, the findings overall are of a high grade serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin.
Shown to Dr ROBERTO GATTAS.
AMENDED DIAGNOSIS:
A to H, J. Right adnexal mass and fallopian tube, omental nodule, uterus with cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary, right pelvic wall nodule, rectal nodule, small bowel nodule, splenic flexure nodules 1 and 2:
- High grade serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin, involving the right adnexa, right ovary,both fallopian tubes, omentum, posterior cervix, right pelvic wall, rectum, small bowel and splenic flexure
I. Spleen: no evidence of malignancy
