B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right anterior vulva stitch at 12&amp;#8221; consists of a U-shaped piece of tissue with stitch indicating 12 o&amp;#8217;clock.  Specimen measures 80 x 80 x 15mm.  Towards the 6 o&amp;#8217;clock end on the left and right are two tags of skin (labia), the right one measuring 25 x 15 x 5mm and the left one measuring 23 x 14 x 5mm.  On the side adjacent to the stitch is a ?punch biopsy site measuring 5 x 5mm.  The skin in the central part of the specimen and extending to the introital margins medially is pale and smooth.  both The deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is bisected along the bridge of tissue connecting the two sides.
Blocks:  1 &amp;#8211; 6 o&amp;#8217;clock TS slice, skin tag on stitch side of vulva; 2 &amp;#8211; TS mid section; 3 &amp;#8211; opposite edge of skin tag; 4 &amp;#8211; skin tag on side of tissue opposite the stitch, 9 o&amp;#8217;clock side, TS; 5 &amp;#8211; TS mid section of skin tag; 6 &amp;#8211; 3 o&amp;#8217;clock side of skin tag; 7 to 25 &amp;#8211; stitch side of vulva (9 &amp;amp; 10, 11 &amp;amp; 12, 13 &amp;amp; 14, 15 &amp;amp; 16, 17 &amp;amp; 18, 19 &amp;amp; 20, 21 &amp;amp; 22, 23 &amp;amp; 24 &amp;#8211; paired blocks); 26 to 52 &amp;#8211; side of vulva opposite stitch; 30, 31, 32, 33 &amp;#8211; paired blocks; 34, 35, 36, paired blocks; 37, 38, 39 &amp;#8211; paired blocks; 40, 41, 42 - paired blocks; 43, 44 - paired blocks, 45, 46 - paired blocks, 47, 48 - paired blocks, 49, 50 &amp;#8211; paired blocks.  Please refer to attached diagrams.  (TO: MS; MS/rt 5.5.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Pfahlert):
A.  Sections show a punch biopsy of skin and subcutis.  The epidermis is hyperplastic and shows prominent involvement by Paget&amp;#8217;s disease.  There is associated hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis.  There is a moderate lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis.  No invasion is seen.  Paget&amp;#8217;s disease extends into hair follicles.
B.  The whole specimen has been blocked.  Sections show extensive Paget&amp;#8217;s disease of the vulva.  Much of the involved epidermis is also hyperplastic and shows hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis.  There is a moderate, patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes in the superficial dermis.  Paget&amp;#8217;s disease involves both of the labial skin tags and extends down into skin appendage structures.
No invasion is seen.
Paget&amp;#8217;s disease extends very close to (1mm from) the 6 o&amp;#8217;clock (introital) margin on the right side (block 17, 19, 21), in the midline, and just to the left of the midline (block 27).
Paget&amp;#8217;s disease extends to the medial excision margin (clitoral margin) on the right side (blocks 23, 25) and the left side (blocks 28, 29).
Paget&amp;#8217;s diseases extends to part of the left lateral excision margin (block 50) and is focally very close to the 12 o&amp;#8217;clock excision margin in the midline (block 25).
Other margins are free of involvement.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Biopsy right anterior vulva:  Paget&amp;#8217;s disease.
B.  Right anterior vulva:  Extensive Paget&amp;#8217;s disease.
