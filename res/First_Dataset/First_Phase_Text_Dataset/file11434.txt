CLINICAL:
Obstructive jaundice secondary to pancreatic head mass.  Adenocarcinoma on previous duodenal biopsy.  Histology - Whipple&amp;apos;s specimen.  Silk suture on bile duct, 1x prolene suture on PV margin, 2x prolene suture on SMA margin, 3x prolene suture on uncinate.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Whipple&amp;apos;s + omentum + gallbladder&amp;#8220;, consists of a pancreaticoduodenectomy with attached omentum, separate gallbladder and several separate omental biopsies.  A separate 17mm lymph node is separate within the specimen container and there is another separate piece of omentum measuring 90 x 50 x 10mm and larger piece of omentum measuring 220 x 90 x 270mm. The pancreaticoduodenectomy has a length of bowel measuring 340mm in length with a maximal diameter of 35mm .  A piece of mesentery is attached to the anterior surface of the duodenum measuring 50 x 40 x 20mm.  An irregularly shaped, pale tan mass includes the pancreas, and measures  60 x 45 x 45mm. Sutures identifying bile duct, PV margin, SMA margin and uncinate process are identified. In the duodenum adjacent to the pancreas is a diffusely infiltrating tumour of pale white appearance in the region of the ampulla.  CBD margin red; PV margin green, SMA margin black, uncinate margin blue, neck of pancreas yellow, posterior pancreas red, anterior surface of pancreas yellow. Specimen sliced superior to inferior displaying a white, diffusely infiltrating tumour within the pancreas into the duodenum. The gallbladder measures 90 x 30 x 7mm and the serosal surface is smooth and shiny with a wall thickness 2mm.  The mucosal surface is green and velvety with no stones appreciated within the lumen. Three pieces of omentum are within the specimen container, measuring 270 x 220 x 90mm, 50 x 40 x 25mm, and 25 x 20 x 15mm. Within the largest piece of omentum are two foci of firm, white calcified tumour, the first measuring 25 x 10 x 3mm and the second measuring 60 x 45 x 25mm.  The distance between these two foci is 230mm.  On sectioning both of the foci of tumour have a white yellow calcified outer area with an inner fatty mucoid centre. The smallest piece contains a single lymph node measuring 17mm. All of pancreatic tissue embedded.
Block 1 - proximal margin; 2- distal margin; 3 - LS CBD margin; 4 - cystic duct; 5 &amp;amp; 6- neck of pancreas margin; 7-14 - pancreatic tumour from superior to inferior; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - lymph nodes from mesentery attached to anterior duodenum; 17, 18, 19 - gall bladder ; 20 - smaller focus of omental tumour; 21-25 - larger deposit of omental tumour, representative sections.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Pun:

SUMMARY PANCREATIC TUMOUR

Size of tumour:  31mm

Histological tumour type

Head of pancreas, with extension into uncinate process

Extent of tumour invasion
Duodenal wall
Peripancreatic soft tissues

Lymphovascular invasion
Present
Type of vessel: Small vessel

Perineural invasion
Present (within the pancreas, block 11)

Perineural invasion of the superior mesenteric artery (uncinate) margin neural plexus
Not identified

Preinvasive lesion
Low grade dysaplasia (PanIN 2), clear of margins

Margins:
Invasive tumour:
Pancreatic neck: &amp;gt; 10mm
Common bile duct:  &amp;gt; 10mm
Portal vein (superior mesenteric vein):  5mm (block 11)
Superior mesenteric artery:  &amp;gt; 10mm
Periuncinate soft tissue:  Positive over a 1.4mm front (inferior uncinate, block 14)
Proximal (stomach):  &amp;gt; 50mm
Distal (duodenal):  &amp;gt; 50mm

Carcinoma in situ/PanIN-3 at margin:  Not seen

Surfaces:
Anterior: 1.3mm (block 11)
Posterior: 0.1mm (block 9)

Lymph nodes:
Number found: 23
Number involved: 4

Other pathology:
- The pancreas shows patchy atrophy and chronic inflammation.
- The gallbladder shows chronic pancreatitis.
- Omentum shows patchy fat necrosis.

PATHOLOGICAL STAGING (AJCC 7th Ed.)
Primary tumour category (pT)
T3 Tumour extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery

Regional lymph node category (pN)
N1 Regional lymph node metastasis

Distant metastasis category (pM)
MX Not assessable by histology

ADDITIONAL REPORT (21/9/67)
MSI staining requested by Prof CARLTON BILINSKI.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining*
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining*
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining*
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining*

* Focal staining present, interpreted as positive

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
