MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sentinel node R&amp;quot; consists of a piece of fatty tissue 25 x 15 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 7 x 5 x 5mm and 5 x 5 x 5xmm.  Imprints from each lymph node done.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; one lymph node (marked as 7mm); 2 &amp;#8211; one lymph node (marked as 5mm).  AE.

(Please refer to attached diagram).
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Additional nodes right axilla&amp;quot; consists of two pieces of fatty tissue including lymph nodes 35 x 25 x 4mm and 12 x 6 x 5mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 12 and 11mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; one bisected lymph node; 2 &amp;#8211; one bisected lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left breast tissue, stitch lateral&amp;#8221; consists of a breast with a stitch marking lateral measuring 150mm (lateral to medial) x 120mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficialto deep).  Superficial margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  The overlying skin ellipse is 130 x 40mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  No lesions are identified on the skin.
The overlying skin ellipse measures 130 x 45mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  No lesions are seen on the skin.  There are patchy pale areas with rubbery consistency throughout the breast.  No discrete indurated lesions are identified.
Blocks:  1 to 3:  2 o&amp;apos;clock 20mm from nipple (deep margin in block 1); 4 to 6 - 25mm 2 o&amp;apos;clock from nipple (deep margin in block 4); 7 to 9 - 25mm 3 o&amp;apos;clock FN (deep margin block 7); 10 to 12 - 12 o&amp;apos;clock 15mm FN (deep margin block 10); 13 - section of nipple and tissue behind nipple; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - upper inner quadrant; 16 &amp;amp; 17 - lower inner quadrant; 18 &amp;amp; 19 - lower outer quadrant; 20 &amp;amp; 21 - upper outer quadrant.

Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined (including sentinel node(s)):  4.
Total number of involved lymph nodes (including sentinel node(s)):  3.
D.  Sections show a 4mm focus of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with solid architecture and luminal necrosis.  No calcification is noted.  This focus lies at the 3 o&amp;#8217;clock position and is well clear of all resection margins.  The remaining breast tissue shows extensive sclerosing adenosis and columnar cell change with associated luminal calcification.  Fibroadenomatoid change is also present.  No invasive malignancy is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Right breast and right sentinel and axillary lymph nodes:
- Invasive ductal carcinoma, margins clear (see above).
- Three positive lymph nodes.
D.  Left breast:   DCIS, margins clear.
