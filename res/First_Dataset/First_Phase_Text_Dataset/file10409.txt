CLINICAL:
Palpable left breast lump.  Left mastectomy and SLN in biopsy.  Pre-operative lymphocyntigrophy SLN localization.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sentinel node left breast&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm containing a lymph node 15mm  in maximum dimension.  The lymph node is AE 2 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sentinel node 2 left breast&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 10 x 10 x 5mm containing a lymph node 8mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph node is AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left breast&amp;quot;, consists of a breast measuring 195 x 175 x 40mm.  There is an ellipse of overlying skin measuring 170 x 115mm.  The nipple areola complex at the centre is unremarkable.  The superficial surface is inked blue and the deep surface is inked black.  The orientation is checked with Dr Brisley and the tumour is lateral.  On sectioning there are two separate lesions present.  The main tumour is located 2 to 3 o&amp;apos;clock approximately 25mm from the nipple.  The tumour measures 35 x 28 x 25mm and the margins are as follows; 100mm &amp;#8211; superior, 50mm &amp;#8211; inferior, 10mm &amp;#8211; deep, 40mm &amp;#8211; superficial, 60mm &amp;#8211; lateral and approximately 110mm &amp;#8211; medial.  The second lesion is located at 4 o&amp;apos;clock 30mm from the nipple and is approximately 15mm from the main tumour.  The second lesion measures 10 x 10 x 10mm and has a haemorrhagic cut surface.  The margins are as follows; 105mm &amp;#8211; superior, 60mm &amp;#8211; inferior, 50mm &amp;#8211; deep, 50mm &amp;#8211; to the skin and 55mm &amp;#8211; closest superficial margin, 60mm &amp;#8211; lateral, and approximately 120mm &amp;#8211; medial.  The rest of the tissue is fibrofatty.  No lymph nodes are found at the lateral end of specimen.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; nipple areola complex; 2 &amp;#8211; tissue deep to nipple; 3 &amp;#8211; main tumour; 4 &amp;#8211; main tumour and deep margin; 5 &amp;#8211; lateral to tumour; 6 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;#8211; medial to tumour; 8 &amp;#8211; second lesion; 9 &amp;amp; 10 &amp;#8211; second lesion and skin; 11 &amp;#8211; upper outer quadrant; 12 &amp;#8211; upper inner quadrant; 13 &amp;#8211; lower inner quadrant; 14 &amp;#8211; lower outer quadrant.
