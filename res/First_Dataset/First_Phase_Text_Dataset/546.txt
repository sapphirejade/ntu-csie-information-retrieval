MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Dudman)
A.  Sections show sun damaged skinextending to subcutis. There is a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 4.0mm thick, extending into mid dermis. The carcinoma is 2.2mm from the closest peripheral margin and 1.1mm from the deep margin. Local excision appears complete. There is no lymphovascular or perineural invasion.
B.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. There is infiltrative moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 8.0mm thick, extending into subcutis. The carcinoma arises on a background of extensive Bowen's disease (carcinoma in situ). The carcinoma is 7.0mm from the peripheral margin and 2.3mm from the deep margin. Bowen's disease is 5.5mm to the peripheral margin. No diagnostic lymph-vascular space or perineural invasion is identified. Local excision appears complete. The adjacent skin shows an actinic keratosis.
C.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. There is an ulcerated, exophytic and keratinising moderately differentiated cell carcinoma, 17.5mm thick, extending into subcutis. The carcinoma is 8.0mm from the closest peripheral margin (9 o'clock margin) and 1.5mm from the deep margin. No convincing lymph-vascular space or perineural invasion is identified. Local excisionappears complete. 
D.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. There is a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 5.5mm thick, extending into deep dermis. The carcinoma is 5.5mm from the closest peripheral margin and 1.1mm from the deep margin. Local excision appears complete. No convincing lymph-vascular space or perineural invasion is identified. The adjacent skin shows an actinic keratosis.
E.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. The skin shows changes of Bowen's disease. Bowen's disease is 3.3mm from the peripheral margin. There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma. 
F.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. The skin shows ulcerated hyperkeratotic hypertrophic Bowen's disease. The Bowen's disease is present very close to the deep margin (0.3mm) and is 3.3mm from the closest peripheral margin. No definite invasive carcinoma is seen. 
G.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. There is well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive Bowen's disease. The carcinoma is 4.0mm thick, and extending into deep subcutis. The carcinoma/Bowen's disease is 5mm from the closest peripheral margin and 1.1mm from the deep margin. No convincing lymph-vascular space or perineural invasion is identified. 
H.  Sections show sun damaged skin extending to subcutis. There is a Bowenoid actinic keratosis extending to the 6 o'clock margin. There is no convincing evidence of invasive carcinoma. 

I.  Sections show sun damaged skin, including underlying cartilage consistent with origin from ear. There is well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive Bowen's disease. The carcinoma is 2.5mm thick, and extending into subcutis, but does not involve the underlying cartilage. The carcinoma/Bowen's disease is 2.2mm from the closest peripheral (3 o'clock) margin and 1.1mm from the deep margin. No convincing lymph-vascular space or perineural invasion is identified. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Skin lesion, left forearm proximal no. 1: Squamous cell carcinoma, clear of margins.

B.  Skin lesion, left forearm distal no. 2: Infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive Bowen's disease, clear of margins. Actinic keratosis. 

C.  Skin lesion, chest wall no. 3: Squamous cell carcinoma, clear of margins.

D.  Skin lesion, dorsum left hand: Squamous cell carcinoma, clear of margins.

E.  Skin lesion, right arm: Bowen's disease, clear of margins. 

F.  Skin lesion, right proximal forearm (oriented): Bowen's disease, very close to deep margin (0.3mm). 

G.  Skin lesion right forearm (oriented): Squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive Bowen's disease, clear of margins.

H.  Skin lesion, dorsum nose (oriented): Bowenoid actinic keratosis, present at 6 o'clock margin.

I.  Skin lesion, left ear (oriented): Squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive Bowen's disease, clear of margins.
