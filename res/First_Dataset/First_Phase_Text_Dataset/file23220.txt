MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr M Tacconi)
A.  Two lymph nodes are identified and in one of these there are sheets and groups of cohesive highly pleomorphic cells including some with somewhat glandular/papillary configuration.  A deposit of carcinoma is also seen in the adjacent fat.
B.  The sections show fibrofatty tissue with a nodule composed of sheets and nests of cohesive cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei including mitotic figures and with multinucleation.  Poorly formed glandular formations are seen.  The appearances are those of high grade carcinoma including high grade serous carcinoma.
C.  The sections show omentum with nodules composed of sheets of pleomorphic cells with some areas showing glandular and papillary architecture and with tumour necrosis.
D.  The section shows fatty tissue with deposit of high grade serous carcinoma.
E.  The section shows to lymph nodes which are largely replaced by high grade serous carcinoma.
F.  The section shows peritoneum with underlying fibrofatty tissue with a deposit of high grade serous carcinoma.
G.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. The endometrium is inactive and there is an endometrial polyp.  Within the myometrium are several benign leiomyomas.  Deposits of high grade serous carcinoma are seen on the uterine serosa.
Both ovaries show deposits of high grade serous carcinoma including with glandular and papillary architecture and pleomorphic nuclei.
Sections of the right fimbrial end fallopian tube (block G8) show focal atypical epithelium on the surface and within stroma consistent with serous carcinoma.
The sections of left fallopian tube are unremarkable.
Carcinoma is also seen on the peritoneum near the round ligament.
H.  Two lymph nodes are identified and contain metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.  There is also a separate nodule consisting of cystic space with necrotic contents with surrounding macrophage and chronic inflammatory reaction.
J.  The section shows lymph node that is almost completely replaced by high grade serous carcinoma.
K.  Sections show two lymph nodes that are almost completely replaced by metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.
L.  The sections show fragments of necrotic tissue including fibrofatty tissue in which there is high grade serous carcinoma.  This may represent obliterated lymph node.  Another smaller lymph node with reactive changes is identified.
M.  The section shows peritoneum with underlying fibrofatty tissue with deposit of high grade serous carcinoma.
N.  The section shows peritoneum with underlying fibrofatty tissue with deposit of high grade serous carcinoma.
P.  The sections show lymph node that is largely replaced by high grade serous carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry (block G24): There is strong diffuse staining for WT-1, PAX-8, p-16, ER, p-53 and with prominent staining for Ki-67.
Comment : There is high grade serous carcinoma involving multiple sites including both ovaries, the uterine serosa, multiple intraperitoneal deposits of serous carcinoma including omental involvement and with multiple lymph node deposits including a right groin lymph node.  The right fallopian tube shows focal serous carcinoma. The left fallopian tube appears unremarkable.
