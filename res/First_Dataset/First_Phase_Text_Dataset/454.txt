CLINICAL:
ILC right breast 12 o'clock - wide local excision + sentinel node biopsy.  Short superior, long lateral, medium medial sutures.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast sentinel node biopsy" consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 8, 10 and 15mm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is AE 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - two smallest specimens; 2- largest lymph node bisected.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion, long lateral, short superior, medium medial" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with three sutures as designated measuring 60mm (medial to lateral), 60mm (superior to inferior) and 38mm (superficial to deep).  The specimen is inked asfollows: anterior blue, posterior black, superior green, inferior red and serially sectioned into 9 slices from medial to lateral.  There is a firm pale tan lesion in slices 3 to 5 measuring 12 x 10 x 8mm.  The tumour margins are as follows:  inferior 18mm, superior 12mm, anterior 10mm, posterior 15mm, medial 18mm and lateral 35mm.  Representative sections in 15 blocks.  Blocks:  1 - representative medial margin slice 1; 2 to 5 - slice 3; 6 to 9 - slice 4; 10 to 11 - slice 6; 12 & 13 - slice 7; 14 - slice 8; 15 - lateral margin slice 9.

ADDITIONAL REPORT (18/7/63)

HER-2 IN-SITU HYBRIDISATION 

Signal Detection has been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche). 

HER2 Dual ISH result: NEGATIVE (nonamplified, diploid) 

Mean HER2 copy number per cell: 1.9 
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 1.7
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.12 

SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations): 
Negative: HER2/CEP17 < 1.8 
Equivocal: HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2 
Positive: HER2/CEP17 >2.2
