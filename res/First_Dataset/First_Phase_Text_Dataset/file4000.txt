HISTORY:
33SCC vulva. Suture 12 o&amp;#8217;clock.
1. Left groin nodes.
2. Right groin nodes.
3. Posterior vulva suture 12 o&amp;#8217;clock
(fresh specimens A-C).
MACROSCOPIC:
lang3081A.  &amp;#8220;RIGHT GROIN NODES&amp;#8221;.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue 50x30x20mm. Three possible lymph nodes are identified, largest measuring 13mm with tan and white cut surface.
(1 lar gest lymph node trisected; 2 second largest lymph node trisected; 3 third lymph node).  RS (9-3)
B.  &amp;#8220;LEFT GROIN NODE&amp;#8221;.  Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue of a total measurement of 50x40x20mm.  Three possible lymph nod es are identified, largest measuring 16mm in maximum diameter.
(1 two lymph nodes; 2&amp;amp;3 largest lymph node in two block [each two TS]).  RS (8-3)
C.  &amp;#8220;VULVA SUTURE AT 12&amp;#8221;.  An orientated piece of skin includi ng part of the posterior vulva with a suture at 12 o&amp;#8217;clock. Skin measures 40mm medial to lateral x 35mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 10mm.  The 12 o&amp;#8217;clock is inked blue, the 6 o&amp;#8217;clock black. There is a white h ard lesion central specimen measuring 16x16mm, appears to be 6mm of the nearest 12 o&amp;#8217;clock margin.  It has a central area of ulceration.  The cut surface reveals an ulcerating firm white lesion 4mm of the nearest deep margin macros copically.
(1-3 LSs 3 o&amp;#8217;clock margin; 4-12 each one TS of lesion and surrounding tissue from 3 to 9 o&amp;#8217;clock margin [all lesional tissue embedded]; 13-15 each two LS 9 o&amp;#8217;clock margin).  RS (M-15/ZH/ank)r
MICROSCOPIC:1   (Dr R Bierschbach)
A.  Three lymph nodes are identified an d these show reactive changes.
B.  Three lymph nodes are identified and these show reactive changes.
C.  The sections show skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue and some deep muscle fibres. There is a broad area  of VIN3 (high grade squamous dysplasia) and with patchy areas of VIN1  (low grade squamous dysplasia).
Arising within the zone of VIN 3 is squamous cell carcinoma that shows two areas with distinctly different morphologies and these may represent two separate adjacent foc i of invasion. They span an area of approximately 15-20mm (present in  5 adjacent tissue blocks) and are described separately  below. d12601908
The first area of  tumour (blocks C5lch-7rsid12601908 ) has the morphology ofs0  moderately differentiated predominantly ngnp3081non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma.  Th ese shows cords and nests of cells with some cells showing vacuolated  cytoplasm although there is focal keratinisation present. There is a  myxoid and reactive stroma and with accompanying lymphocytic infiltrate. 69 This tumour focus infiltrates to a depth of s22  1.9mm and measures nsrsid9123169 approximately 7mm in diameter in the sections.
The second angnp3081area of tumour (blocks C8-9) af1has the23169  morphology of moderately differentiated large cell keratinising  squamous cell carcinoma. There is a desmoplastic reaction and moderate lymphocytic reaction in the surrounding stroma and has a depth of invasion of 2.5mm.  It measures approximately 0337mm in diameter.
cs1  Both foci of hsquamous cell carcinomas are well clear of the deep margin (at least 5mm).  No vascular space invasive or perineural invasion is seen.
Squamous cell carcinoma is at least 8mm from the 12 o&amp;#8217;clock margin (C9) and is 1 1mm from the 6 o&amp;#8217;clock margin (C9).
VIN 3 is 5mm from  the 12 o&amp;#8217;clock margin (C8, C9, C11) and is 8mm from the 6 ouote clock margin (C8).  VIN 3 is not seen in sections from the 3 and 9 o&amp;#8217;clock margins.  In several areas low grade squamous dysplasia (VIN1)tlch is seen closer to margins ( 3mm from 3 o&amp;#8217;clock margin &amp;#8211; block C1).
