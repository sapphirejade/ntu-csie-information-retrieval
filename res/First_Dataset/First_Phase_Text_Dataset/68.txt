CLINICAL:
Left ovarian cyst.  Ca stomach.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left ovary and left fallopian tube" consists of a cystic ovary 180 x 160 x 80mm with attached fallopian tube 40mm in length and up to 10mm in diameter.  The serosal surface of the ovary is smooth.  Slicing reveals a multilocular cyst filled with clear fluid.  There are no papillary excrescences.
Blocks:  1 - representative fallopian tube; 2 to 19 - representative sections.
(MK/rt 13.2.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Chalender):
Sections of the ovary show a benign unilocular cyst lined by columnar to attenuated epithelium with occasional foci of old haemorrhage within the wall.  No definite endometrial stroma is identified.  The features favour a benign serous cystadenoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
Left ovary and fallopian tube:  Favour benign serous cystadenoma of the ovary.
