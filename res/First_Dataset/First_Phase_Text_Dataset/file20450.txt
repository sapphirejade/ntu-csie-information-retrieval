HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Previous appendiceal cancer (previous appendicectomy) with peritoneal disease.
1. Right colon and terminal ileum.
2. Omentum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT COLON + OMENTUM&amp;quot;.  A right hemicolectomy specimen including terminal ileum measuring 235mm in length and up to 25mm in circumference, caecum, ascending and part of transverse colon measures 230x70mm.  Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 65mm.  The mesentery of the terminal ileum shows up to 10 tumour deposits 5-18mm. The largest is invading into the underlying tissue through the terminal ileum wall to ulcerate the overlying serosa over an area of 10x10mm.  This deposit is located 170mm of the proximal margin macroscopically and 280mm of the distal margin.  There is a nodule at the caecal wall at the anatomical position of the appendiceal stump measures 17x17x10mm.  It involves the caecal wall and the overlying serosa with no definite mucosal involvement.  No other definite peritoneal deposits are identified.  The mucosal surface shows no polyps or tumours.

(1 promximal margin; 2 distal margin; 3 RS terminal ileum serosal nodule; 4&amp;amp;5 RS tumour nodule terminal ileum ulcerating the mucosa [tumour tissue banking block is block 5]; 6&amp;amp;7 tumour nodule at caecal wall; 8 RS caecal mucosa; 9 apical lymph node; 10&amp;amp;11 each five lymph nodes)

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 550x160x20mm.  No definite nodules are identified. The cut surface is fatty along the specimen.  Representatives of these firm areas are taken.

(12-15 omentum)

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue 80x60x35mm with glistening surface peritoneal covering. The cut surface reveals a firm white tubular structure.  No definite tumour nodules are identified.

(16 RS omentum and firm structure).  RS (M-16/ZH 8/4/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. X. Vlasak)
Sections show deposits of moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with transmural involvement of terminal ileum including involvement of mucosa and involvement of mesentery, muscularis propria and submucosa of caecum. The free mesothelial surface is invovled by carcinoma in caecum and terminal ileum.

Lymphovascular invasion is noted in terminal ileum adjacent to the tumour deposits.

The rest of the small bowel mucosa and colonic mucosa show no focal abnormality.

9 local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes.

Sections through the omentum show no evidence of tumour.

The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion.


DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT COLON AND OMENTUM:
- DEPOSITS OF MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA IN TERMINAL ILEUM AND CAECUM.
- NO INVOLVEMENT OF OMENTUM IDENTIFIED.
