MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix + tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries measuring 150 x 100 x 100mm with a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm and appears unremarkable.  On opening there are two nodules within the myometrium;  Nodule 1:  left side of the uterus measures 50 x 50 x 45mm and shows areas of haemorrhage and calcification.  Nodule 2: right side  of the uterus measures 15 x 15 x 10mm and appears to have a solid cut surface.  Numerous other smaller fibroids are identified from 5 to 15mm.  All have a whorled and unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of7mm.  The right ovary measures 28 x 17 x 15mm and has a unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary measures 25 x 18 x 13mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 - frozen section nodule one; 2 - frozen section nodule two; 3 - frozen section of endometrium; 4 to 8 - full LS of right side of uterus; 9 to 14 - full LS of left endometrium and underlying myometrium; 15 - representative nodule two; 16 - representative other fibroid identified; 17 to 20 - representative nodule one; 21 - right tube; 22 - right ovary; 23 - left tube; 24 - left ovary.
