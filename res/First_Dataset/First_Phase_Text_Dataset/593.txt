CLINICAL:
Micro Ca and invasive Ca (small) in UOQ of (R) breast.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right sentinel node 1" consists of one nodewith fatty tissue measuring 22 x 12 x 7mm.  TAE 1 block.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast marking stitch at 12 o'clock" consists of a right mastectomy measuring 225 x 162 x 31mm with overlying ellipse of skin including nipple measuring 210 x 118mm and weighing 589.8g (received in formalin).  The skin surface shows some Campbell de Morgan spots but is otherwise unremarkable.  There is a marking suture taken as 12 o'clock.  The deep margin is inked black, the remaining margin is inked blue.  At the 9 o'clock position 35mm from the nipple there is a cystic/haemorrhagic area with fibrosis measuring approximately 20 x 30 x 25mm.  The remainder of sections show fibrofatty breast tissue.  It is located 15mm from the skin, at least 20mm from the deep margin, 25mm from the inferior-superficial margin and it is well clear of the superior-superficial margin.  The remaining tissue is fibrofatty.
Blocks:  1 - representative nipple; 2- tissue deep to nipple; 3 - deep margin surrounding lesion; 4 - deep margin to lesion; 5 - lesion including skin; 6 -lesion superficial not including skin; 7 & 8 - deep margin to lesion; 9 & 10 - deep margin to lesion; 11 & 12 - lesion with skin; 13 & 14 - representative upper outer quadrant; 15 & 16 - representative lower outer quadrant; 17 & 18 - representative lower inner quadrant; 19 & 20 - representative upper inner quadrant.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary node" consists of a node with fatty tissue measuring 17 x 14 x 6mm.  TAE 1 block.  (TO: MY YP/mm 18.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr L Stefl):
A. Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy on AE1/3 staining and levels.
B. Sections show 30 mm of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid and cribriform types, adjacent to a haematoma.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
The adjacent breast tissue shows benign microcalcifications and intraduct lobular neoplasia (LCIS, classical variant).
The nipple appears unremarkable.


DCIS proforma
Maximum extent of DCIS: 30mm
Nuclear grade:   high
Architecture: solid, cribriform
Necrosis:   absent
Calcification:   absent
Excision Margins:  > 10mm all margins
C. Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy on AE1/3 staining and levels.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Right Sentinel lymph node 1: one lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
B. Right mastectomy:
- 30mm high grade DCIS adjacent to a haematoma, > 10mm all margins
- No evidence of invasive malignancy
C. Right axillary lymph node: one lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
