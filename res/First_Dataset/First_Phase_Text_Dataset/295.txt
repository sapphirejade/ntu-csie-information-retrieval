***ADDITIONAL REPORT (26/2/59): MICROSATELLITE MARKERS (12.11.63)

CLINICAL:
Sigmoid tumour lap high ant resection.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of a segment of large bowel 165mm in length with attached mesenteric fatty tissue (120 x 50 x 12mm).  The entire specimen is above the peritoneal reflection.  There is a circumferential polypoid tumour 52 x 45 x 15mm.  The tumour is 37mm from the closer resection margin and 105mm from the other resection margin.  There is possible extension of the tumour into the muscularis propria (block 8).
Blocks:  1 - two LS at the closer resection margin; 2 - shave margin, the other margin; 3 to 5 - representative TS of tumour; 6 & 7 - representative LS of tumour; 8 - representative TS of tumour; 9 - the apical lymph node bisected; 10 - lymph nodes are seen; 11 - one bisected lymph node; 12 - one bisected lymph node; 13 - likely lymph nodes; 14 to 16 - each one bisected lymph node.  (TO: SS; WT/rt 12.6.63)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr X Cortina)
The sigmoid colon tumour is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for colorectal carcinoma follows:
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA
Macroscopic Description
Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon. 	
Maximum tumour diameter: 52mm.
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 37mm.
Tumour perforation: No.

Microscopic Description
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved.
Lymphovascular invasion
Not identified.
Perineural invasion
Present.
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: Fourteen.	
Number of lymph nodes involved: None.
There is a 5.5mm extramural nodule of tumour (block 16) which shows no definitive cuff of residual lymph node or surrounding fibroelastic tissue. This is best considered an extramural tumour nodule (satellite nodule)(N1c). 	
pN1c	Tumour deposit(s) in the subserosa, mesentery, or nonperitonealised 	pericolic or perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
There is a tumour associated pericolic abscess which extends throughout the subserosal fibroadipose tissue and is associated with an active serositis. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
Pending.
Tumour Stage (TNM 7th Edition): 3A (pT2N1cMx)	


DIAGNOSIS:
Anterior resection: 
52mm pTNM Stage 3A moderately differentiated sigmoid colon adeno-carcinoma. 
Focal perineural invasion and associated pericolic abscess.
5.5mm extramural tumour nodule (satellite nodule).
No evidence of malignancy in fourteen lymph nodes (0/14).

Markers of microsatellite instability are being performed and a supplementary report will be issued.
