DR WENDELL ESTEBAN RON-FROMETA
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
IDC left breast.  L axilla sentinel node biopsy.  IDC left breast 1 o'clock mastectomy + axilla tail tissue.  Sutures short superior long lateral.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary sentinel lymph node", consists of a lymph node 8 x 5 x 3mm.  Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - remaining tissue.  AE.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative.
Phone results to Dr VIRGIL-FRITCHER by Dr H Hilding at 7:00pm on 18.2.63
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast sutures long lateralshort superior", consists of a mastectomy specimen with two marking stitches 290mm (lateral to medial) x 170mm (superior to inferior) x 48mm (superficial to deep).  The overlying skin measures 170 x 70mm.  No lesions are seen on the skin.  Thenipple is prominent and 15mm in maximum dimension.  The nipple is off centre close to the periphery of the skin ellipse.  Superficial margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  At 1 o'clock 40mm from the nipple there is an indurated pale solid tumour 25 x 23 x 20mm.  The tumour is 3mm from deep, 65mm from inferior, 85mm from superior 60mm from lateral and 200mm from medial margins.  The tumour is 15mm from the overlying skin.  No other discreet lesionsare identified.
Blocks: 1 - section of tumour with no margins; 2 and 3 - paired sections tumour in relation to deep margin (margin in block 3); 4 - tumour and deep margin; (reserved block); 5 - tumour and skin; 6 - section of nipple; 7 - tissue behind nipple; 8 and 9 - random sections upper inner quadrant; 10 and 11 - random sections lower inner quadrant; 12 and 13 - random sections lower outer quadrant; 14 and 15 - random sections upper outer quadrants.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla tail", consistsof two pieces of fatty tissue 45 x 25 x 15 and 25 x 15 x 7mm.  Both pieces are sliced and examined for lymph nodes.  AE 6 blocks.  (ZD/vo 19.2.63)
