HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Please check Ki67 if neuroendocrine tumour. Peritoneal surface tumour for frozen section. Omentectomy, Rt colon, rt ovary, rt iliac lymph node. Appendix cancer with peritoneal mets - debulk.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;PERITONEAL SURFACE TUMOUR&amp;quot;. Multiple pieces of friable pale pink/red tissue 5x5mm up to 25x3x3mm. Sample for frozen section.

F/S: &amp;quot;Multicystic lesion with mesothelial  appearing proliferation ?peritoneal inclusion cyst?&amp;quot;. Reported by Dr Q Capracotta to Prof Manza at 11.56 on 24.11.16.

(1 frozen section A; 2 frozen section A residual tissue). AE (M-2)

B. &amp;quot;RIGHT COLON, OVARY, OMENTUM&amp;quot;. Multiple organs. A gallbladder 48x20x10mm. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny. The mucosal surface is green and velvety. The average wall thickness is 3mm. However at the fundus there is an area of thickening, ?adenomyomatous hyperplasia and at this the wall is up to 5mm in size.

(1 shaved cystic duct margin ?section adjacent showing gallbladder neck and TS of gallbladder body; 2 LS of gallbladder fundus showing thickened area).

The right ovary and section of fallopian tube. The right ovary is present and measures 37x26x23mm. It appears to be cystically dilated with one main simple cyst 30mm in maximum diameter. The right ovary and fallopian tube is 20g. The fallopian tube is present 42mm in length and up to 14mm in diameter. Attached to the fallopian tube is a piece of fibroadipose tissue with overlying serosa 135x75x8mm. The cystic cavity in the ovary contains clear straw coloured fluid. The lining of the cystic cavity and the ovary is thin walled and smooth.

(3 LS fimbrial end of tube; 4-6 RS TS of fallopian tube and adjacent ovary).

The serosa attached to the fallopian tube and ovary appears macroscopically unremarkable.

(7 two RS from serosa attached to ovary and fallopian tube).

There is a right hemicolectomy, total length 195mm with right colon 135mm in length and 76mm in open circumference. The ileum is 75mm in length and 45mm in opened circumference. There is up to 58mm of attached mesentery. The appendix is present and markedly dilated. It is 35mm in length and dilated at 12mm in diameter. There appears to be adherent serosa overlying the appendix. The distal staple margin of right hemicolectomy is inked blue and proximal stapled margin of the right hemicolectomy is inked green.

(8 LS proximal and distal resection margins from right hemicolectomy).

The roughened retroperitoneal area of the adipose tissue overlying the caecum and part of appendix is inked in blue. There is a pale, cream coloured tumour within the appendix lumen and extending out to the serosal surface, 20x12x32mm. The tumour appears to abut the serosa as well as the blue inked soft tissue retroperitoneal margin.

(9&amp;amp;10 TS through the appendix; 11&amp;amp;12 each contain LS bisected ends of the appendix; 13 section between tumour and caecum). Please note that block 9 has been designated the tumour block for tumour banking.

A diverticulum  is present in the colon, containing a solid faecolith 10mm in diameter.

(14 one bisected node; 15 five nodes; 16 possibly involved node showing relationship to serosa and blue inked soft tissue margin; 17 one bisected node; 18 one bisected node; 19 five nodes).

There are numerous pieces of peritoneum present, separate and unorientated within the specimen jar 50-105mm in size and 110x110x15mm in aggregate. A possible obliterated blood vessel is present 3mm in diameter possibly the remnant umbilical vessel.

(20 sections of piece of serosal tissue and possible umbilical vessel. A piece of presumed greater omentum is present 350x150x10mm. The greater omentum appears macroscopically normal on section.

(21 RS of greater omentum). RS (M-21)	Further tissue (22 Rs diverticulum, 23-35 additional lymph nodes- 23-1 lymph node bisected, 24-1 lymph node bisected, 25- 5 small lymph nodes)

C. &amp;quot;RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 32x18x10mm and 48x16x6mm.

(1 one bisected node; 2 one bisected node; 3 one trisected node; 4 one quadresected node; 5 one bisected node; 6&amp;amp;7 one enlarged node serially sectioned). RS (M-7/LK/ht).

MICROSCOPIC:     (Dr. Q. Wissing)
A.  Sections show peritoneal fragments with mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate including mild surface mesothelial hypeprplasia and focal foreign body granulomatous reaction. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Sections through the appendix show a 32mm well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid tumour) replacing the appendiceal lumen and wall and extending into the mesentery of the appendix including involvement of the free mesothelial  surface. The tumour shows an insular and trabecular pattern of growth and has a mitotic rate of 1/10hpf.  No necrosis or lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The tumour extends directly into the caecum at the base of the appendix with involvement of caecal wall and submucosa.  Extranodal deposits of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour are also seen in appendiceal mesentery as well as on the caecal serosa adjacent to the appendiceal base.

The rest of the colon shows an uncomplicated diverticulum and melanosis coli.  The small bowel shows no significant abnormality.

1 out of 20 lymph nodes examined from the right hemicolectomy specimen show metastatic neuroendocrine tumour.  In addition there are two extranodal deposits of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour in the mesentery of the right hemicolectomy specimen.

Sections through the omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments show no significant abnormality.

Sections through the ovary show a follicular cyst. The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality. Sections through soft tissues attached to the serosa of the ovary show a deposit of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour.

Sections through the gallbladder show no significant abnormality.

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive staining with Cam5.2, chromogranin, synaptophysin and CD56.  Ki-67 shows a variable proliferative index ranging from 1% with occasional &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; up to 7%.

COMMENT: In view of the hot spots of proliferative index up to 7% the tumour is best classified as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour WHO grade 2.

C.  Sections show six reactive lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
PERITONEAL SURFACE TUMOUR :
-BENIGN MESOTHELIAL  HYPERPLASIA AND INFLAMMATORY INFILTRATE.  NO TUMOUR SEEN.

RIGHT COLON, OVARY, OMENTUM :
-WELL DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOUR WHO GRADE 2  (CARCINOID TUMOUR) OF THE APPENDIX WITH EXTRANODAL DEPOSITS IN APPENDICEAL MESENTERY AND MESENTERY OF RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY SPECIMEN AND DEPOSIT ON CAECAL SEROSA.

-METASTATIC CARCINOID TUMOUR TO 1 OUT OF 14 LOCAL LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

-DEPOSIT OF WELL DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOUR IN SOFT TISSUE ATTACHED TO SEROSA OF OVARY.

-NO EVIDENCE OF TUMOUR IN SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS, OMENTUM OR GALLBLADDER.

RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODE :
-NO TUMOUR SEEN IN 6 LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.
