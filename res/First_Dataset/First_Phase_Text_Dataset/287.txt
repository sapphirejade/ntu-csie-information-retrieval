Adenocarcinoma of the prostate Gleason 3 + 4 on biopsy.  Bilateral pelvic nodes and prostate and seminal vesicles.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 55 x 45 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 25 x 5mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1 - lymph node; 2 - remaining tissue.  AE.
C.  Specimen labelled "Prostate" consists of a prostate measuring 38 x 55 x 35mm and weighing 50.7g.  The right vas deferens measures 15mm in length and the left vas deferens measures 20mm in length.  The right seminal vesicle measures 33 x 18 x 15mm and the left vas deferens measures 30 x 23 x 18mm.  The left half is inked blue and theright black with anterior was inked red.
