MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right fallopian tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of a fallopian tube, 45 x 10 x 9mm, with attached ovary, 37 x 27 x 19mm.  The distal tube is adherent to the ovary.  No discrete lesions are seen in the ovary.
Block 1 &amp;amp;  2- TS fallopian tube; 3-9 - ovary with adherent distal fallopian tube (3/4 and 5/6 - paired blocks).  Fallopian tube and ovary AE.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left fallopian tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of a fallopian tube, 53 x 10 x 9mm,  with attached ovary, 28 x 25 x 15mm.  There are several simple cysts within the ovary.
Blocks 1 to 3 - fallopian tube; 4-5 - ovary.  Fallopian tube and ovary AE.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Endometrial curettings&amp;#8220;, consists of pale grey and tan tissue, 15 x 16 x 5mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omental biopsy&amp;#8220;, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue, 15 x 10 x 8mm.  BAE 1 block.   (TO:  JB/ec  1.2.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Sherraden):
A &amp;amp; B.  Both specimens show similar histological features.  The fallopian tubes show a mild patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the plicae, more prominent in the right compared to the left tube.  These features are consistent with a mild chronic salpingitis.  No acute inflammation or granulomas are seen.  A cystic corpus luteum and cystic follicles are seen in the ovaries.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.  The uterine curettings contain late secretory endometrium.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.
D.  The omental biopsy shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A &amp;amp; B.  Right and left fallopian tubes and ovaries:  Chronic salpingitis.  No evidence of malignancy.

C.  Endometrial curettings:  Late secretory endometrium.

D.  Omental biopsy:  No significant abnormality.
