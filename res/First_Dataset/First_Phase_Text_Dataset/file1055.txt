i0HISTORY:
srsid10435149 Appendix Ca peritonectomy. Right hemicolectomy. Omentum. Splenectomy. Anterior resection. Small bowel. Gastric (antral resection).
MACROSCOPI C:
&amp;quot;SPLEEN, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, RECTUM, PARTIAL STOMACH&amp;quot;. Consists of an extended right hemicolectomy, measuring 300mm in total . The colon measures 250mm and the terminal ileum measures 50mm in length. Terminal ileum is 20mm in diameter and the caecum measures up to 60mm in diameter. There is attached pericolic fat up to 300mm and  omentum up to 350mm, which is  adhered to the pericolic fat. The appendix is identified, measuring 15mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter. The tip of the appendix is adhered to the pericolic fat, and is surrounded by mucin. The re are three small polyps in the ascending colon ranging from 2-3mm, the most distal polyp is more than 15mm from the distal resection margin. The mucosal surface of the terminal ileum and caecum is unremarkable. On sectioning, the append ix wall is thickened up to 4mm thick. No faecolith is identified. On sectioning, the appendix tip is adhered to the mesoappendix. 15 lymph nodes were identified within the pericolic fat, ranging from 2 up to 9mm, also multiple mucinous tu mour nodules are identified, ranging from 5 up to 15mm. The omentum contains multiple mucinous nodules ranging from 2mm and in areas forming an omental cake, up to 150mm.
Also separately in the specimen jar is a segment of small bo wel, measuring 55mm in length and up to 20mm in diameter. There is attached mesentery 60x15x15mm. The external surface is unremarkable. The mucosal surface is also unremarkable. There is a separate segment of stomach within specimen jar , measuring 65x45x35mm. The serosal surface is unremarkable and the mucosal surface is unremarkable. There is a segment of rectosigmoid, measuring 200mm in length and up to 35mm in diameter, with pericolic fat measuring up to 200mm. The ser osal surface of colon and rectum is slightly ragged. No definite tumour nodules are identified. The mucosal surface is unremarkable. Also within the specimen jar is a spleen, measuring 125x80x40mm and weighing 130g. The external surface  shows haemorrhage and white plaques ranging from 3 up to 15mm. Cut surface of the spleen is unremarkable. There are multiple separate pieces of peritoneum and omentum in aggregate 260x170x50mm. Multiple mucinous tumour deposits are pre sent throughout this tissue, ranging from 5 up to 90mm. Cut sectioning of omentum reveals a firm, white nodule which appears to be ovarian tissue, which is embedded in mucinous tumour. The presumed ovary measures 20x15x8mm. On further s ectioning, possible fallopian tube is identified, also embedded within fatty tissue, measuring 50mm in length and up to 5mm in diameter.

7177 MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. J. Plienis)
Sections show involvement of the distal appendix by  a low-grade mucinous neoplasm. The normal appendiceal mucosa is replaced by mucinous secreting epithelium with a villiform and serrated profile and low nuclear grade. In most areas, this atypical mucosa is limited by the  muscularis propria. At the tip of the appendix, a site of probable perforation is identified and there is extensive extra appendiceal mucin whi ch includes strips of atypical mucinous epithelium with low grade nuclear features. There is also extensive extracellular mucin incorporating strips of low-grade mucinous epithelium involving the seros al surface of the right and left colon segment, the distal stomach, spleen and ovary, as there is also extensive involvement of  the omentum and peritoneum. The appearances are those of low-grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix (WHO, A JCC) with pseudomyxoma peritonei.
Three sessile serrated adenomas are identified in the right hemicolectomy segment. Sections of the mucosa of segments of small and large bowel ared10435149  otherwise within normal limits. Seventeen benign reactive pericolic lymph nodes are sampled. Sections of the parenchyma of the spleen and ovary are within normal limits and the sections of t he gastric mucosa are unremarkable.
