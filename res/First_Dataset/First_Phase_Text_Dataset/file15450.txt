Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Excision of sacral chordoma with ellipse of skin and caudal sacrum.  Sacrum transected S3/4. Marking sutures: short superior/long left lateral/double deep.  Capsule breached on left side of pelvis (deep aspect).  Further left lateral margins resected and sent as separate margins.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Sacral chordoma, stitch short - superior, long - left lateral, double - deep&amp;#8220;, consists of an ellipse of orientated skin with attached underlying soft tissue and bone which weighs 440g.  The ellipse of skin measures 150mm from superior to inferior, 60mm from left lateral to right.  The underlying soft tissue measures 150mm from superior to inferior, 70mm from left lateral to right and 120mm from skin surface to deep.  The specimen is orientated with short suture marking superior, long suture marking left lateral and double suture marking deep.

The skin surface appears slightly soft at the middle, measuring 70 x 60mm but is otherwise unremarkable.  The skin surface shows no scar.

At the deep inferior aspect of the specimen a nodular polypoid tan/green lesion is noted measuring approximately 90 x 80 x 50mm and occupying the inferior half.  The superior half deep margin is not connected to the tumour.  The nodular lesion appears to be capsulated with a breach in the capsule present at it s left lateral aspect, in area measuring approximately 60 x 50mm.

A segment of sacral bone is noted at the middle of deep aspect of the specimen, 50x40x30mm.  A defect is noted at the at the centre of the superior aspect of the specimen adjacent to the sacral bone.  A separate  piece of the lesion is found within  this defect.  Dr DOMINIQUE WERGIN has kindly examined the specimen and confirms that the defect is not a true margin.

The left lateral of the specimen is inked blue, right lateral is inked black, sacral margin is inked green and the area of the capsular breach at left lateral of the lesion is inked red.

The specimen is serially sliced from superior to inferior into twenty-seven slices.   A vaguely lobulated fairly well-defined lesion is noted extending from slice 8-27, measuring 89 x 80 x 60mm. The lesion has approximately 98% solid and 2% cystic appearance.  Approximately 60% of the lesion has fleshy tan brown appearance which is mostly located underlying the skin and is associated with haemorrhage as well as an area of calcification, 10 x 8 x 8mm.  Approximately 40% of the lesion has a fleshy pale and more solid appearance.  Probable necrotic areas are noted.   The lesion is abutting right lateral, left lateral, deep and inferior margins.  It is 35mm from superior margin.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;New left lateral margin (1)&amp;#8220;, consists of a very irregular piece of tan haemorrhagic fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 35 x 5mm.

The specimen is serially sliced from one end to the other into eleven slices and serially embedded in 7 blocks.  AE 7 blocks.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Second new left lateral margin (2)&amp;#8220;, consists of an irregular piece of unorientated tan tissue measuring 30 x 18 x 4mm.  Specimen is unorientated and one side is arbitrarily inked blue and the opposite is inked black.  On sectioning no gross lesion is identified.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Starliper):
A.  Sections show skin, subcutis with underlying deep soft tissue including adipose tissue, fascia, striated muscle, cartilage and sacral bone.  The deeper structures are located in the  inferior two thirds of the the specimen which is expanded by a  90mm  sacral chordoma.  The tumour is predominantly circumscribed with a  lobular growth pattern.  The tumour focally encases pre-existing sacral trabecular (eg. A71), however it transgresses cortex with the bulk of the tumour located in deep soft tissues and subcutis reaching the mid dermis (eg. A41  &amp;amp; A7).  Whilst mostly circumscribed with a peripheral thin fibrous pseudocapsule there are areas in which tumour directly interfaces with adjacent  tissue (eg. A11 &amp;amp; A23) as well as outlying nodules separated by intervening uninvolved soft tissue up to 3mm of (eg. A28 &amp;amp; A46).  The tumour cells are predominantly arranged in chords as well as some nest within an myxoid matrix within which there are fibrous septa.  The tumour cells vary from relatively monomorphic with round to oval nuclei, vesicular chromatin  small nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm to larger cells with highly vacuolated cytoplasm compatible with with physaliferous  cells.   The majority of the tumour appears conventional however very focally there are foci of chondroid differentiation (A33 &amp;amp; A28). 	There are areas with only scattered pleomorphic cells (eg. A31)whilst elsewhere, including toward the inferior end of the specimen, nuclear unrest becomes more confluent in some areas (eg. A45 &amp;amp; A56). Focally the tumour show features compatible with a cellular mitotically active spindle cell sarcoma with admixed osteoclast like giant cells compatible with focal dedifferentiation (A59).  The dedIfferentiated component is located in the inferior aspect of the specimen.  No perineural or lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Elsewhere there are rare rare foci of necrosis (A57 &amp;amp; A58) and rare mitoses. There are patchy admixed chronic inflammatory cells.  No overlying dermal scar is identified.

Immunohistochemistry:
In the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows
Positive:  EMA, AE1/AE3, S100
Negative:  PAX8 and SOX10

The  immuNoprofile is compatible with cHordoma.

Margins.
The margins of clearance are as follows:

Conventional chordoma.
Superior:  		Well clear &amp;gt; 20mm.
Right lateral:  	0.6mm (at the level of subcutis with intervening fat) Block A25.
Right lateral: 	0.1   (at the level of deep soft tissues (A52 &amp;amp; A54)
Left lateral: 	Positive (A45 &amp;amp; A48) or &amp;lt;0.1mm (A42 &amp;amp; A52) (at the level of deep soft tissues)
Inferior: 		&amp;lt;0.1mm (A58) at the level of deep soft tissues
Deep:  		&amp;lt;0.1mm (A55)
Sacral bone:  	Where well defined this margin is well defined it appears about 2.5mm clear, however in several sections  the true margin is ill defined or there is specimen disruption with free floating lobules of tumour, including some bearing ink (eg. A33 &amp;amp; A68).  As such completeness of excision here cannot be guaranteed.
COMMENT:
Due to the presence of outlying nodules in the main specimen,  true clearance at the close margins may not be present.  Further correlation with the intraoperative assessment of clearance is necessary.
Dedifferentiated chordoma:
Inferior:	About 7.5mm clear (A59) with intervening conventional
chordoma and fibroadipose tissue.
B.   Sections show fibroadipose tissue and striated muscle.  There are lobules of conventional chordoma including at inked and diathermied periphery of the specimen (B2 and B3).  The tumour is present in four slices.
C.  Sections show adipose tissue containg medium to large nerve bundles and vessels.  No tumour is identified.
D.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue and striated muscle.   There is a focus of acute haemorrhage within fibrous tissue containing a small foci of conventional chordoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
A-D.  Sacral chordoma, new left lateral margin 1, new left lateral margin 2 and new left lateral margin 3:
-  90mm sacral chordoma, predominantly conventional type, focal chondroid component, focal dedifferentiation, positive left lateral margin in main and additional specimens, see text and comment for other margins.
