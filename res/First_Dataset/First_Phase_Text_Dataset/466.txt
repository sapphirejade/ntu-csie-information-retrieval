CLINICAL:
Low anterior resection.  DVT, CRC, HTN.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Low anterior resection" consists of a segment of bowel which measures 175mm in length and lies entirely above the peritoneal reflection.  There is attached pericolic fat which measures 170 x 110mm and contains multiple lymph nodes.  On opening the bowel there is a polypoid tumour which measures 45 x 30mm which is located 20mm from the distal margin.  Several small polyps are identified adjacent to the tumour which range from 1 to 3mm.  The closest of these is located 10mm from the distal margin.  On sectioning the tumour appears to invade into the muscularis propria.  No definite serosal invasion is seen.  Proximal margin inked red, distal margin inked green, mesenteric margin inked black.
Blocks:  1- tumour with distal margin; 2- proximal margin; 3 - polyp closest to distal margin; 4 - remainingpolyps; 5 - tumour level of deepest invasion; 6 to 8 - representative tumour (Block 8 reserve block); 9 - further representative tumour; 10 - representative normal mucosa away from tumour; 11 - apical lymph node; 12 to 15 - lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a donut of bowel which measures 20 x 15 x 10mm.  Staple marginis inked black.  BAE 1 block.  (WT/mm 14.8.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Hedgepeth & Dr H TERRELL-Kerper):
A & B.  Sections show adenocarcinoma.  The features are as follows:

Relation oftumour to anterior peritoneal reflection:	  Above.

Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS.
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate.
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria.
Tumour involvement of margins

Number of lymph nodes involved:  1.	
pN1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Hyperplastic polyp x2 plus one possible tubular adenoma. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining 
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining 
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining 
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining 
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
