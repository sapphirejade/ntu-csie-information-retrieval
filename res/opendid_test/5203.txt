HISTORY:  
Debulking PMP. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
"SMALL BOWEL". Received four segments of small bowel all of which appear to be with ragged outer surface and extensively involved with mucinous deposits on its outer wall. The smaller piece appears to be with a possible stoma opening measuring 30x25mm with underlying segment of bowel up to 40mm. The otherfragments measure: 65x35mm with disrupted lumen, 125x45mm with multiple bowel segment adherent to each other and in-between firm white deposits and 200x50mm.The mucosal surface of all fragments is oedematous but no polyps are identified.Received also multiple fragments of firm tan nodule mixed with mucus material and blood clots measuring 130x70x25mm in aggregate. 
(1&2 ?stoma (first fragment) ; 3 representative second fragments one TS; 4&5 area of adherent bowel lumens in third fragment with serosal deposits; 6 fourth segment one TS with serosal deposit; 7&8 representative of separate nodules). RS(M-8/OS/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Q Cima)show multiple segments of small bowel. Along the serosa extending into muscularis propria, there are large mucin pools within which strips of mucin secreting epitheliumshowing moderate to high-grade dysplasia are identified. There is desmoplastic stroma reaction in keeping with mucinous adenocarcinoma. Adhesion between small bowel segments is noted. Focally, the small bowel mucosa show ischemic infarction. The separate fragment received show changes of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma, probably within peritoneum.
DIAGNOSIS:  
SMALL BOWEL
- MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING SMALL BOWEL SEROSA AND PERITONEUM.
