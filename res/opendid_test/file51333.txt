NIPPLE:  No
MUSCLE:  No
MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral, 15 slices
FINDINGS/LESION:  There is a well demarcated tumour in slices 7-12, measuring 20 mm medial to lateral x 16mm anterior posterior x 11mm superior inferior.
