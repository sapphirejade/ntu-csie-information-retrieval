HISTORY:
Serous endometrialca. Frozen section. Uterus, tubes and ovaries, omental biopsy, right pelvic nodes, left pelvic nodes. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "RIGHT ROUND LIGAMENT". A piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20x15xc15mm. No focal lesions seen. Three TS for frozen section. 
F/S: "No evidence of malignancy". Reported by Dr H Burdex on 20.2.65.
block and piece of irregular tissue measuring 20x20x10mm. AE (M-2).
B. "UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES AND TUBES". A uterus, bilateral ovaries and tubes. The uterus measures 80x80x45mm. The right ovary measures 20x15x5mm. The right fallopian tube measures 60x6mm. The left ovary measures 20x15x5mm. The left fallopian tube measures 50x5mm. The tissue inked anterior blue, posterior black. There is a fibroid tissue attached to the left side of the uterus measuring 40x35x30mm. There is another fibrous tissue measuring 30x20x40mm. 
(1 left fimbria; 2&3 left fallopian tube; 4&5 left ovary; 6 right fimbria; 7&8 right fallopian tube; 9&10 right ovary; 11 anterior ectocervix; 12 posterior ectocervix; 13-18 uterus [please refer to diagram]; 19-21 fundus; 22 fibroid tissue; 23 anterior parametrial tissue; 24 posterior parametrial tissue). RS (M-24).
C. "RIGHT SIDE LYMPH NODE". Multiple pieces of irregular fatty tissue measuring 30x30x15mm. AE (M-3).
D. "LEFT SIDE LYMPH NODE". Multiple pieces of irregular fibrofatty tissue measuring 30x20x10mm. AE (M-3).
E. "OMENTUM BIOPSY". A piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 55x40x5mm. AE (M-5/YP/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Dubas)
A. Sections show fibroadipose tissue and smooth muscle, containing several tiny mesothelial inclusion cysts. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
B. Sections of uterus show an area of high-grade serous carcinoma involving the endometrium of the mid and posterior fundus. The architecture of the fundus is distorted by a large, extensively infarcted leiomyoma within the anterior body and fundus, which distorts the endometrial cavity and compresses the myometrium posteriorly in the area ofthe fundus. Serous carcinoma shows focal invasion in the fundus of 3mm, through a myometrium which is 7mm in thickness. A small endometrial polyp is noted within the body of uterus. Surface serous carcinoma in the fundus shows extension down into underlying endometrial glands. Focal adenomyosis is also noted within the fundus. Cystic atrophy is noted within the endometrium of the body and the lower uterine segment. 
Sections of the left and right fallopian tubes show no significant atypia of the tubal epithelium. Sections of the left ovary show a small focus of endosalpingiosis on the surface. Sections of the right ovary are unremarkable. Sections of cervix show no significant atypia of either the ectocervical squamous epithelium or the endocervical columnar epithelium. 
Sections of the anterior and posterior parametrial tissue show no evidence of malignancy. 
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA:
Type: High-grade serous carcinoma
Myometrial invasion:  Invasion limited to inner half of myometrium.
Depth of myometrial invasion: maximum 3mm throughout myometrium thickness of7mm. 
Focality:  Unifocal
Tumour involves: fundus  
Vascular/lymphatic invasion:  Not seen
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Involvement of uterine serosa:  Not involved
Non-tumour uterus:  
Adjacent endometrium:  endometrial polyp and focal adenomyosis.   
Adnexae:
Left fallopian tube:  Not involved
Right fallopian tube:  Not involved
Left ovary:  Not involved
Right ovary:  Not involved
Pathologic Staging (AJCC/UICC TNM 7, FIGO 2008):

TNM stage: Primary Tumour, pT1a, Tumour limited to endometrium or invades less than 1/2 of the myometrium. 
Regional lymph nodes: pN0. No regional lymph nodes metastases (Specimen C&D). 
FIGO stage: 1. Tumour confined to the corpus uteri 1A (no or less than half myometrium invasion). 
Immunohistochemistry including MSI has been performed on the biopsy 29Z55497. Please refer to this report (29Z55497) for results.
C. The single lymph nodes show reactive changes only. No tumour involvement is seen. 
D. Multiple fragments of lymphoid tissue are present, and all show reactive changes only. 
E. Sections show lobulated mature adipose tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT ROUND LIGAMENT:
- SMALL BENIGN PERITONEAL MESOTHELIAL INCLUSION CYST. 
B. UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES AND TUBES:
- SEROUS CARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM, pT1a, pN0 (SPECIMENS C&D). FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE TEXT.
C. RIGHT SIDE LYMPH NODE:
- REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
D. LEFT SIDE LYMPH NODE
- REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
E. OMENTUM BIOPSY:
- NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
