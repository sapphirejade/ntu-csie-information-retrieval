CLINICAL NOTES:
GII endometrial adenoca.
Uterus, tubes + ovaries.  Right sentinel node.  Left sentinel node.  Omentum.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES&amp;quot;.  A total hysterectomy specimen 165g, consisting of a coronally opened uterus 90x65x60mm.  The cervix measures 40x30x30mm.  Attached is a right fallopian tube 70x6mm, right ovary 24x10x10mm, left fallopian tube 60x7mm and a cystic left ovary 37x25x20mm.  Anterior cervical margin inked blue, posterior inked black.  The opening is completed and there is an intrauterine contraceptive device IUCD in situ.  There is tumour in the anterior and posterior fundus and body. It measures 40x30mm.  It involves the left cornu macroscopically but clear of the parametrial resection margin 13mm and cervical resection margin 35mm.  There is no extension to the cervix or serosal surfaces. The tumour has a tan, partially exophytic and partially endophytic cut surface and 13 out of 22mm thick.  Three white whorled nodules are identified within the myometrium, the largest measures 33x25x20mm the remainder two are 7mm and 8mm in maximum diameter.  The cut surface of both tubes is unremarkable.  The cut surface of the right ovary is unremarkable.  The left ovary has  cyst with a smooth haemorrhagic inner lining.

(1 right fallopian tube; 2 right ovary; 3 right parametrium; 4 left fallopian tube; 5&amp;amp;6 ovarian cyst left; 7 left parametrium; 8-11 LS anterior uterus from cervix to fundus; 12&amp;amp;13 maximum invasion of tumour anterior body [13 is tumour block for tissue banking]; 14 tumour into left cornu; 15-18 LS posterior uterus from cervix to fundus; 19 largest fibroid left posterior body).  RS (M-19)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  A lymph node 24x13x4mm serially sliced.  AE (M-1)

C.   &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Four lymph nodes 10mm, 15mm, 13mm and 11mm.

(1-4 each one lymph node).  AE (M-4).

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM&amp;quot;.  A piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum 30x10x2mm in aggregate.  The cut surface is unremarkable, serially sliced.  AE (M-1/ZH 22/10/2070 nh)

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 28/10/67
Immunostains for MSI proteins (BRIGHAM & WOMEN'S HOSPITAL WALCHA MULTIPURPOSE SERVICE; block: A12 )
MLH1: Absent (lost)
PMS2: Absent (lost)
MSH2: Present (intact)
MSH6: Present (intact)
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
