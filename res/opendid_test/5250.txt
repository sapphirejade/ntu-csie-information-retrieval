CLINICAL:
?Thymoma.  ?Germ cell tumour.  Anterior mediastinal mass.
Small portion for Bio Banking.  Defect on the specimen with blue inked.  Created when sampling by EC 24.4.66.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Thymic tumour" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue.  The larger piece has a circumscribed tan mass adjacent to fibroadipose tissue.  This piece measures 90 x 55 x 35mm.  One aspect is inked blue and the opposite black.  Thetumour bulges into the surrounding fibrofatty tissue and has a smooth capsular outer surface.  The mass measures approximately 40 x 38 x 35mm. The cut surface of the tumour shows a cystic lesion lined by soft cream tumour and filled with necrotic material.  There are bony fragments within the wall of the cyst, as well as areas of haemorrhage.  The tumour appears to bulge into the surrounding unremarkable fibrofatty tissue.  No other mass or lesions identified.
The other piece of fibrofatty tissue measures 60 x 50 x 10mm and has a smooth, thinly capsulated surface.  The external surface is inked black.  On sectioning, the cut surface is composed of fibrofatty tissue only.  No mass or lesions are identified.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative separate piece of fibrofatty tissue; 3, 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14, 15 & 16 - thymic mass.  AE; 17 - fat adjacent to thymic mass; 18 to 20 - representative adjacent fibrofatty tissue; 21 - tumour for Bio Bank.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Openshaw):
The 40mm tumour is a thymoma.  The tumour is encapsulated and contains thin fibrous septae dividing the mass into angulated lobules. The tumour  is composed of individually dispersed as well as occasionally aggregated neoplastic AE/AE3 and P63 immunopositive epithelial cells within a rich lymphoid stroma composed of small bland, predominantly immature, T lymphocytes which express CD3 and TDT and which coexpress CD4 and CD8. There are interspersed tinngible body macrophages.  The thymic epithelial cells display oval to elongate nuclei with crisp nuclear membrane, conspicuous small nucleoli, open chromatin and minimal cytoplasm.  The tumour shows organotypical differentiation with TDT negative palemedullary islands containing CD20 positive B cells and very occasional Hassall's corpuscles amongst the predominant cortical type areas described above.  Mitoses are rare, and there is no necrosis. Perivascular serum lakes are not conspicuous.
The morphology is compatible with a  mixed thymoma WHO type B1/B2 (B1 90%, B2 10%)   equivalent to a well  differentiated thymoma according to the Suster  Moran classification scheme.
Although there is a well defined capsule and there is some artefactual capsular disruption,  there are multiple areas where tumour penetrates the capsule and infiltrates into surrounding atrophic thymic tissue or adipose tissue, including some foci  which directly interface withthe inked resection margin (Block 3, 4,6, 10, 12, 16, 17).  (Masaoka-Koga staging system IIa) The tumour focally reaches the inked peripheral margins here. 
The separate fibrofatty specimen is mature adipose tissue only.
There is no evidence of thymic carcinoma or germ cell tumour.
DIAGNOSIS:
Anterior mediastinal mass:
- Thymoma mixed type B1/B2 (WHO grading system), invades capsule (Masaoka-Koga stage  IIa,), focal positive margins.
