SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 6/5/66

Appendix tumour PMP.  Peritonectomy.  Total colon (right with primary appendix tumour).  Distal pancreas.  Spleen.  Part of the stomach.  Omental cake with right colon.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, SMALL BOWEL, STOMACH AND COLON, ADRENAL".  Comprises of small bowel, right colon, transverse colon with attached omentum and appendix received en masse. Received separately is a segment of large bowel with attached peritoneum consistent with sigmoid colon, a separate segment of large bowel, partial gastrectomy specimen, spleen, one adrenal, pancreas, gallbladder and three separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue consisting ofperitoneum.  All the pieces are covered extensively by mucinous deposits of tumour.
Small Bowel - It measures 808mm in length x 30mm in maximum diameter. The attached mesentery is up to 50mm. The serosa is covered by mucinous deposits of tumour. On opening the lumen there are normal mucosal folds.  No discrete mass lesions are identified.

Caecum is up to 55mm in depth, ascending colon measures 220mm in length with a diameter of 50mm.  On the serosal surface extensive areas covered by mucinous deposits of tumour.  On opening the lumen there is a polyp with a velvety appearance at the level of the ileocaecal valve.  It measures 20mm.
(26 polyp; 27 section of ascending colon)
Transverse colon measures 340mm in length with maximum diameter of 40mm.  The serosa is covered by extensive mucinous deposit.  On opening the lumen there are normal mucosal folds.  No discrete lesions.  Attached mesocolon is up to 70mm wide and attached omentum measures 440x180x40mm.  It is covered extensively by mucinous deposits of tumour.
(28-31 omentum; 32 omentum including transverse colon)
Segment of large bowel consistent with sigmoid colon with attached anterior peritoneal reflection.  It measures 330mm in length with proximal diameter of 50mm and distal diameter of 30mm. The attached peritoneal reflection measures 300x160x30mm and attached mesocolon is up to 80mm.  The serosa and peritoneal reflection is covered by mucinous deposits of tumour.  On opening the lumen the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds.  No discrete lesions are identified. 
(33&34 section of sigmoid colon [33 mid sigmoid colon, 34 distal margin]; 35&36 attached anterior peritoneal reflection)
Attached to theanterior peritoneal reflection is umbilicus measuring 40x20x20mm. The skin surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning the underlying skin shows mucinous deposits of tumour.
(37&38 umbilicus)
The second segment of separate large bowel measures 150mm in length x 35mm maximum diameter. Mesocolic fat is up to 130mm. The serosa is covered by mucinous deposits of tumour.  Attached mesocolic fat is covered by mucinous deposit of tumour.  
(39 large bowel showing serosal deposits of tumour; 40 mesocolic fat showing deposits of tumour)
Spleen - It weighs 519g and measures 130x50mm. The capsule is covered extensively by mucinous deposits of tumour which pushes the splenicparenchyma. The parenchyma is otherwise red and spongy.  Noted adherent to the capsule, is ? adrenal gland.  It measures 40x30x22mm. 
(41&42 spleen; 43&44 spleen with ? adrenal gland)
Adrenal Gland weighing 34gand it measures 65x30x30mm.  The capsule is interrupted and is ragged in appearance.  On sectioning the cut surface is haemorrhagic.  
(45&46 adrenal gland)
? pancreas - It weighs 13g and measures 50x40x50mm.  On sectioning the cut surface is pale yellow.  
(47&48 ? pancreas)

Partial Gastrectomy - It measures 160mm in length and ranges from 35-70mm in diameter. The serosal surface is covered with extensive mucinous deposits of tumour.  On opening the mucosa shows normal rugal folds.  
(49&50 sections of stomach showing mucosa and mucinous deposits of serosa)
The separate pieces of omentum altogether measures 300x150x20mm.  There are extensive mucinous deposits.
(51&52 sections of peritoneum including mucinous deposits)
Gallbladder - It measures 75mm in length x 20mm in maximum diameter. The serosa appears smooth.  On opening the lumen the mucosais granular green in appearance.  The wall is up to 2mm thick.
(53 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 54 body and fundus)
Found separately is a piece of oval cuff like tissue.  It measures 20x20x6mm.  On sectioning the cut surface reveals areas of coarse calcification.  
(55 sections of calcified tissue).  RS (M-55/HE/ank)
BLOCK 16 re-allocated to tumour reserve block.
11/5/66 Residual portion of necrotic lymph node sampled in block 55 removed from specimen and referred to microbiology for TB PCR testing at the request of the infectious diseases team.
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. C. Paleaae)
The appendix has been extensively sampled.There is a low grade mucinous neoplasm of the distal appendix. The distal luminal mucosa is replaced by atypical mucinous epithelium with flat and patchy villiform architecture and low to intermediate grade cytology. This mucinous neoplasminfiltrates through the full thickness of the appendiceal wall with pushing expansile invasion to form an extensive mucinous tumour on the serosal aspect of the appendix. There is no infiltrative invasion, or high grade cytology, and overall the features are those of a low grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix (LAMN).  
There is extensive involvement of peritoneal aspect of a number of organs by similar appearing mucinous tumour with features in keeping with low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (DPAM). As in the appendix, there is no apparent infiltrative invasion, desmoplasia or high grade cytology. The low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei involves the serosal aspect of all of the large bowel segments, the small bowel, the stomach and the spleen. There is also extensive involvement of the omentum and peritoneum together with involvement of the subcutaneous tissue deep to the umbilicus. The splenic involvement is characterised by capsular and parenchymal involvement. Sections  of the adrenal gland show haemorrhage and congestion of the medulla. The adrenal cortex shows otherwise normal morphology. Sections of the uninvolved splenic parenchyma are withinnormal limits and sections of  the pancreas are unremarkable. The gallbladder mucosa shows mild chronic inflammation. 
A tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia is sampled at the level of the ileocaecal valve.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
Sections of the last described "oval cuff of tissue" show a portion of alymph node with prominent foamy macrophages together with a number of sclerotic nodules showing central necrosis. Scanty bacilli are present on an Auramine immunofluorescence stain. No organisms are seen on Ziehl Neelson stain and no fungal elements are seen on PAS or Grocott stains.
The organisms on the Auramine stain show morphology suggestive of acid fast bacilli. While the Auramine stain is more sensitive than the Ziehl Neelson stain for detection of acid fast bacilli, it would have been helpful to have seen bacilli on both stains.
Suggest clinical correlation.
