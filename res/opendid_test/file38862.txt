CLINICAL NOTES:

1. Histo.
2. H pylori.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;GASTRIC BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Two pieces of tissue, measuring 4 and 5mm. AE (2-1/JK 8/10/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. F Maciag)
Both biopsies show non acid secreting gastric mucosa.  Within the lamina propria in both biopsies, there is a patchy infiltrate of cells, singly and in small groups, which have hyperchromatic finely granular nuclei and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Also present within this infiltrate are small numbers of signet ring cells with abundant, finely granular pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and peripherally located hyperchromatic nuclei.  Many of these cells within the lamina propria shows cytoplasmic positivity on the ABPAS and mucicarmine stains, with strong cytoplasmic positivity seen within the signet ring cells.  These cells are positive on a Keratin CAM5.2 immunohistochemical stain, and are negative on a CD68 stain, although scattered histiocytes are also present.  The features are those of  adenocarcinoma of signet ring cell type  (Lauren&amp;apos;s diffuse type).  Correlation with clinical, imaging and endoscopic findings is recommended.  No intestinal metaplasia is seen, and no Helicobacter-like organisms are detected.
