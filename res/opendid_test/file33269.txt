Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Right breast 12 o&amp;apos;clock 10mm IDC.  HWL wide local excision plus sentinel node biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right axilla sentinel node&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 20 x 12 x 7mm containing two possible lymph nodes measuring 5 and 8mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node per block bisected; 3 - remaining fat.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right breast lesion stitch long lateral short superior medium medial&amp;quot;, consists of an oriented piece of fibrofatty tissue weighing 16.2g and measuring 45mm medial to lateral, 38mm superior to inferior and 20mm superficial to deep.  There is a hookwire inserting through the anteromedial aspect with the tip embedded within the tissue.  The tissue is inked superior red, inferior green, superficial blue and deep black.  The specimen is sliced from medial to lateral into eight slices.  The hookwire is seen to insert between slices four and five.  Within slice three and four there is a firm spiculated mass measuring 10 x 7 x 7mm located 1mm from the nearest deep margin.  The mass lies within 8mm of the superior margin.  All other margins are greater than 10mm clear.  The tissue adjacent to the lesion appears diffusely fibrofatty in appearance and no other lesions are identified.  Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - LS through medial margin slice one; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - slice two; 5 &amp;amp; 6 - slice three; 7 &amp;amp; 8 - slice four; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - slice five; 11 &amp;amp; 12 - slice six; 13 - slice seven; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - LS lateral margin slice eight.  AE.  Please see diagram for block description.  (TO:AP/rs 9/1/69)
