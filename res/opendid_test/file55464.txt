CLINICAL NOTES:
Ovarian Ca with abdominal nodule
Abdominal wall nodule

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;ABDOMINAL WALL&amp;quot;.  An ellipse of skin measuring 30x13mm with underlying fatty tissue to a depth of 30mm.  At the deep margin a possible serosal surface is identified over 10x15mm. The resection margins are inked blue.  The cut surface reveals a yellow to tan nodule deep to the skin measuring 20x15x12mm abutting the deep resection margin.

(1 LS of each peripheral margin including edge of skin; 2-4 each one TS mid).  RS (M-4/ZH 9/8/2071 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr Z Motto)
The sections show skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue.  The epidermis and dermis appear unremarkable.  Within the subcutaneous tissue there are sheets of tumour with high nuclear grade cytology and with poorly-formed glandular spaces.  Numerous mitotic figures and apoptotic figures are seen.  The appearances are consistent with high grade serous carcinoma.  There is also dense fibrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with previous surgery effect.  Carcinoma is present at the diathermied/inked lateral and deep edges of the specimen.
Comment:  The appearances are consistent with high grade serous carcinoma.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
