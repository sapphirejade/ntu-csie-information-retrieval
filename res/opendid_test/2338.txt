Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Complex ovarian cyst, Ca125 - 43.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an enlargedovarian mass measuring 200 x 160 x 120mm.  The external surface is smooth and intact.  The cut surface is multiloculated with a smooth inner lining and no solid areas found.  There is a fallopian tube on the external surface measuring 100x 10 x 10mm.  Two representative sections for frozen section.
On further examination there are three tiny solid nodules on the inner surface of the cysts from 5mm to 10mm maximally.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section deblocked; 3 to 15 - ovary; 16 - fallopian tube; 17 to 21 - further sections of tiny nodules.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Mucinous cystadenoma with no atypical features.
Result to Anaesthetist by Dr F Mcabee at 9:35am on 13.04.2065.
(TO: UC; ZF/rt 14.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Carlow):
Sections show a mucinous tumour of the ovary with a spectrum of change within the mucinous epithelium from benign, to borderline, to intraepithelial carcinoma.
In addition, there are several foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma measuring up to 15mm in greatest dimension.  Some of these foci appear to be mergingwith the mucinous epithelium, and some are invading into the wall of the cysts producing 'mural nodules'.  The foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma show focal DPAS positivity suggestive of mucinous differentiation, show focal areas reminiscent of squamous cell carcinoma and show focal areas reminiscent of clear cell carcinoma; however overall it is best classified as anaplastic carcinoma.
The borderline and intraepithelial carcinoma areas are positive for CK7 and CK20, and only very focally weakly positive for CDX2.  The features are consistent with an ovarian primary.
Thefallopian tube is unremarkable.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
This report was discussed with Dr F. Jakubek at 14:00 on 15/04/65.
DIAGNOSIS:
Borderline mucinous tumour of the right ovary with intraepithelial carcinoma and foci of anaplastic carcinoma.
