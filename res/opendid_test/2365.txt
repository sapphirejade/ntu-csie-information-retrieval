CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass.  CA125 54.  20cm ovarian mass - frozen section benign.  Present with abdo mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right fallopian tube and ovary", consists of an ovary measuring 245 x 180 x 120mm with a smooth serosal surface. There is an adherent distal segment of fallopian tube measuring 40 x 10mm.  Sectioning of the ovary reveals a multiloculated cyst filled with yellow fluid. Two areas with papillary excrescences roughly 30mm in size are seen.  No solid areas are present. Two pieces for FS.  Remainder for paraffin section.  
Block 1- FS 1; 2 - FS 2; 3 to 13 - representative cyst wall with papillary excrescences; 14 - LS complete fimbrial end fallopian tube; 15 - TS remainder of fallopian tube .
FROZEN SECTION;  Benign serous cystadenoma. 
Reported by Drs S Tyminski/S Walzer to anaesthetist #26853 14:30hrs on 26/05/65.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary, cervix and uterus", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, and left tube and ovary weighing 160g in total.  There is also a segment of proximal right fallopian tube measuring 47mm in length with a diameter of 7mm.  The uterus measures 94 x 55 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and has an unremarkable appearance.  The posterior uterus and cervix are inked blue.The endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 25mm in maximum thickness.  The left fallopian tube measures 49mm in length with a diameter of 6mm; there is a small cluster of paratubal cysts (1-2mm diameter) at the fimbrial end. The left ovary measures 63 x 60 x 40mm.  The left ovary has a multiloculated cystic appearance and a smooth grey outer surface.  The inner cyst wall is smooth apart from a single pale yellow nodular area (8 x 8 x 10mm).  RS 16 blocks.
Blocks 1-5 - midline LS posterior uterus and cervix; 6-9 - midline LS anterior uterus and cervix; 10 - representative TS right fallopian tube segment; 11 - LS complete fimbrial end left fallopian tube; 12 -mid TS left fallopian tube; 14-16 - representative left cystic ovary (13 - solid area). 
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omental tissue measuring 320 x 110 x 14mm.  No lymph nodes or tumours are identified in the omental tissue.  RS 3 blocks.  (TO: JF/ec 27.5.65) 
 

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Quilling) 
A.  Sections of the right ovarian mass confirm the diagnosis if a benign serous cystadenofibroma.  The multi-locular cysts are lined by a single layer of columnar ciliated cells with simple papillary processes and no evidence of architectural complexity.  The stroma is mainly dense and fibrotic composed of proliferating fibroblasts with focal oedematous change.  There are no atypicalfeatures present.  No stromal invasion is identified.  Occasional ovarian parenchymal elements can be seen.  The right fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.
B.  Sections of the uterus show cystic inactive endometrium, scattered areas of adenomyosis, and benign small transmural leiomyomata.  The cervix appears unremarkable.  The left ovary also shows a benign serous cystadenofibroma of similar appearances.  The focal solid nodule described macroscopically is an acellular calcified nodule.  The left fallopian tube containssimple paratubal cysts and otherwise appears unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections of omentum appear unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right fallopian tube and ovary:  
-  Benign ovarian serous cystadenofibroma.
-  Unremarkable fallopian tube.
B.  Left fallopian tube and ovary, cervix and uterus:
-  Inactive endometrium, adenomyosis, and leiomyoma.
-  Unremarkable cervix.
-  Benign ovarian serous cystadenofibroma.
-  Paratubal cysts.
C.  Omentum:  Unremarkable
