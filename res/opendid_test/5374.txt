SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.7.66):


CLINICAL:
G1EAC uterus, solid left ovary, raised TMs.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received in formalin, unopened and consists of uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 145g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 65 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The soft tissue margin is inked green anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 23 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrial cavity is expanded by an ill defined and largely necrotic tumour 78 x 45 x 30mm.  On sectioning the myometrium surrounding the tumour appears attenuated.  The tumour appears to have a sharp border with the surrounding myometrium.   The right ovary measures 20 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm long and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 35 x 25 x 15mm and has homogeneously pale solid cut surfaces.  The left fallopian tube is 65mm long and 7mm in diameter.   
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6 to 10 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 11 to 15 - sections of tumour including full thickness of myometrium (block 11 - reserve block); 16 - right fallopian tube and right ovary; 17 to 19 - RS left ovary; 20 - RS left fallopian tube.  The MSI stains have not been requested.  (TO: BC; EB/ta 22/6/66)  


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Aquero)
The endometrial tumour is a FIGO grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is partially exophytic and infiltrates up to 8mm into a uterine wall 11mm thick. There are foci of lymphovascular space invasion. There is no evidence of uterine serosal, cervical, ovarian or tubal involvement by carcinoma. A benign uterine leiomyoma is seen. The cervix shows no significant abnormality. The right ovarian lesion is a focally calcified benign fibroma. The bilateral fallopian tubes and left ovary show no significant abnormality. 


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes: 
*	FIGO Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma; invades 8mm into uterine wall 11mm thick; lymphovascular space invasion.
