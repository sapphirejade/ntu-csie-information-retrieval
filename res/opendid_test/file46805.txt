Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrial carcinoma with mixed clear cell/papillary morphology.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;L external iliac lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue with ? lymph nodes approximately 17mm in total.  Fat trimmed.  Remainder for FS (in five pieces).  AE 1 block.
FROZEN SECTION:  One negative lymph node (0/1)
Result to Dr Kohlmeyer by Dr O Belliston 18:40pm on 23.05.66.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Cervix, uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes + ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 96g in total. The uterus measures 85 x 65 x 32mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 37 x 33mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains a fibroid measuring 15mm in diameter.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 24 x 11 x 11mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 25mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 33 x 12 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 &amp;amp; 5 - slice 7 of anterior body (myometrium fibroid); 6-8 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - RS of slice 6 and 7 of posterior body (myometrium fibroid); 11 - right fallopian tube; 12 - RS of right ovary; 13 - left fallopian tube; 14 - left ovary RS.  RS 14 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right external iliac sentinel lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of unoriented irregularly shaped fibrofatty tissue measuring 28 x 15 x 5mm.  Two possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5mm to 18mm.  AE 2 blocks (1 - one possible lymph node serially sliced,
2 - one lymph node).
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of unoriented irregularly shaped fibrofatty tissue measuring 100 x 54 x 13mm.  The specimen is serially sliced.  No lymph nodes, nodules or lesions are identified.  RS 3 blocks.  (TO:JM/ec 27/7/69)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Solares):
A.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 6mm through a wall 16mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix is ulcerated.  The endocervix is uninvolved and unremarkable.
Both tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.   The omentum is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 6mm through a wall 16mm thick.  Cervix uninvolved.  Three lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 9/7/66:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.
MLH1  Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2  Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2  Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6   Equivocal nuclear staining.

Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes above is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI) and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
