CLINICAL NOTES:
Large ovarian mass. Ca125 normal.
1. Uterus with cervix right ovary and tube.
2. Left ovary and tube.
3. Omental biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS WITH CERVIX, RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE&amp;quot;. A hysterectomy specimen, 235g already opened coronally by the surgeon consists of a uterus measuring 115x70x50mm.  Attached is a right fallopian tube 75x10mm and a cystic right ovary 40x30x25mm.  The attached cervix measures 40x40x35mm.

There is a posterior pedunculated cervical polyp measuring 25x15x10mm, appears to be confined to the mucosa.  A second polyp is located in the anterior endocervical canal measuring 15x10x5mm also confined to the mucosa.  The endometrium is up to 4mm thick. The myometrium is trabeculated and up to 35mm.  It becomes bulky posteriorly and replaced by two white whorled intramural fibroids measuring 30x25x20mm and 10x10x7mm.  Multiple ( up to 10 ) smaller fibroids are identified 5-8 mm in maximum diameter.  The outer surface of the tube has multiple paratubal cysts 2-15mm in maximum diameter.  They are with a smooth outer surface and filled with a clear serous fluid. The tube cut surface is unremarkable.  The right ovary cut surface reveals a multilocular cyst with a smooth inner lining measuring 35mm in maximum diameter.  It has no papillary excrescences or solid areas.

(1-4 LS anterior uterus from cervix to fundus with block 1 including anterior endocervical polyp; 5 remainder detached part of the endocervical polyp anteriorly; 6-11 LS posterior uterus from cervix to fundus; 12-14 posterior uterus cervical polyp; 15 left cornu fibroid; 16 fimbrial end serially sliced ; 17 two TS tube; 18-20 RS right ovary). RS (M-20).  [Please see block diagram]

B.  &amp;quot;LEFT OVARY AND TUBE&amp;quot;. An opened and partially collapsed cystic ovary, 375g, measuring 140x125x55mm  with attached unremarkable fallopian tube 50x6mm.   The collapsed opened cyst is multiloculated and has multiple papillary excrescences covering about 10% of its surface area and measuring 5mm to 23mm in maximum diameter.  There is an intact cyst 100x80x60mm filled with mucinous material with multiloculated and firm mucinous areas measuring 45 x35 mm.

(1 fimbrial anteriorly slice;d 2 three TS mid tube; 3-7 areas of papillary excrescences; 8-12 firm cystic areas within the mucinous cyst). RS (M-12)

C.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue 50x40x10mm with unremarkable outer and cut surface.  Serially sliced.  AE (M-3/ZH 18/2/2071 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. H. Billing)
A.  The ectocervix is unremarkable. The endocervix shows benign endocervical polyps and Nabothian cysts. The endometrium is in proliferative phase. The myometrium shows multiple benign leiomyomas.  The fallopian tube shows a benign paratubal cyst and focal endometriosis.  The ovary is atrophic and contains follicular cysts and a largesimple cyst lined by bland cuboidal to spindled cells and fibrous stroma.  There is no malignancy.

B.  The fallopian tube shows a benign paratubal cyst.  The ovarian cyst is lined complex papillary and cribriforming structures which are lined by mucinous epithelium and randomly scattered goblet cells.  There are some grossly oedematous rounded papillae as well as very thin firbous papillae.  The lining epithelium mostly shows mucinous morphology with basal nuclei and apical mucin, however in some areas the epithelium shows elongated pencillate nuclei filling the cell with minimal cytoplasm and rare mitoses.  In other areas there are oncocytic epithelial cells with some signet-ring features.  There are no high grade nuclear features and no invasive malignancy.

Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse strong positive staining for PAX8 and CK7.  There is patchy focal staining for CDX2 and CK20.

Overall, the features are of a borderline mucinous tumour.  The immunohistochemistry pattern supports a primary ovarian neoplasm.  However clinical and radiological correlation is recommended.

C.  Sections show lobulated omental fat with mature adipose tissue, with some vessels and fibrous septa.  The surface shows patchy mesothelial hyperplasia.  There is no malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  UTERUS WITH CERVIX, RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE:
- BENIGN LEIOMYOMAS
- BENIGN ENDOCERVICAL POLYP
- OVARIAN SIMPLE CYSTS AND FOLLICULAR CYSTS
- ENDOMETRIOSIS OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBE
B.  LEFT OVARY AND TUBE:
- MUCINOUS BORDERLINE TUMOUR, INTESTINAL TYPE
C.  OMENTAL BIOPSY:
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
