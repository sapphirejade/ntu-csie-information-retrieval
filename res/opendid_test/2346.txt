CLINICAL:
Ovarian cancer debulking post neo-adjuvant chemo.  Previously well.  Nil regular meds.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 52g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 40 x 25mm and has a smooth shinyserosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures approximately 40mm in length x8 x 8mm in maximum dimension.  There is a white plastic clip amongst the adnexal structures ?previous tubal ligation procedure.  The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 10mm and hasan unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures approximately 45mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum diameter.  There is a white plastic clip in the adnexal structures ?previous tubal ligation surgery.  The left ovary measures 15 x 7 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:  1- anterior cervix and lower uterine body; 2 to 4 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix with anterior body endometrium attached; 5 & 6 - right fallopian tube (fimbria all embedded); 7 & 8 - right ovary plus adnexa; 9 & 10 - left fallopian tube (fimbria end all embedded); 11 & 12 - left ovary plus adnexa.  AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix measuring 42mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The serosal surface is minimally haemorrhagic and covered with patchy areas of fibrinous exudate.  The wall thickness is 2mm and the mucosa appears unremarkable.  AE.
Blocks:  1- proximal surgical margin two LS proximal; 2 - two TS mid; 3 - two LS distal.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 360 x 120 x 40mm.  The omentum appears smooth lined on one surface with small areas of haemorrhage.  On sectioning no discrete masses are identified.  Representative in three blocks.  (TO:QM:  UX/mm 29.3.65)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr H Dechamplain) 
A.  Tiny foci of chemotherapyaffected adenocarcinoma are present in the wall of the right fallopian tube, within and on the surface of the left ovary, and within the left paradenexal soft tissues.  The appearances are consistent with a high grade serous carcinoma.
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The uterine serosa shows scattered adhesions with calcifications.
B & C.  The appendix and the omentum show scattered adhesions with calcifications but no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma involving the right fallopian tube, left ovary and left paradnexal soft tissues (minimal tumourpresent ?left ovary primary ?peritoneal primary).
