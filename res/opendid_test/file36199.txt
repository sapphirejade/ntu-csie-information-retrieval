HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
MUNDUBBERA MULTIPURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE AND SUTHERLAND HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
Appendix tumour (PMP).
Peritonectomy specimen for Histopathology (omentum, right colon, rectosigmoid, uterus, ovaries, spleen, tail of pancreas, and diaphragm stripping).

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, RECTOSIGMOID, UTERUS, OVARIES, TAIL OF PANCREAS, DIAPHRAGM STRIPPING&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple pieces of organ in the same jar including:

Hemicolectomy - The portion of terminal ileum, 50mm in length, 30mm in circumference, and portion of colon, 140mm, 50mm circumference. There is an enlarge and distorted appendix with mucinous appearance, measuring 40x30x30mm. Cut sectioning shows dilated appendix filled with mucin and with a possible involvement of appendiceal wall and mucinous extravasation.
There is a block of uterus, ovaries and tubes and rectosigmoid with attached perirectal fat. Uterus and cervix measures 80x60x40mm. No obvious cancer involvement present. However, multiple adhesions, especially attached to the posterior aspect of the uterus. Right fallopian tube measures 30mm and 7mm in diameter. Multiple paratubal cysts present. Possible mucin identified around the tube and also in the cervix. Left ovary measures 30x20mm. Left ovary measures 30mm in length and 10mm in diameter.
Portion of pancreas with attached fatty tissue, 45g, and it measures 45x40x40mm. There is adhesion over the surface.
Spleen weighing 131g and measures 110x70x50mm. There is a mucinous cover in the middle of the spleen. Sectioning shows possible capsule involvement. No obvious infiltration to the parenchyma.
Multiple pieces of peritoneal fat, measuring 130x80x60mm, and multiple pieces of omentum, 180x130x70mm.
Multiple pieces of diaphragm, 80x40x30mm in aggregate are also identified. Diaphragm is covered by mucin.

(1 proximal and distal surgical margin and right hemi; 2 base of appendix to the caecum; 3&amp;amp;4 apex of appendix; 5&amp;amp;6 one section of appendix; 7-9 one section of appendix; 10-13 one section of appendix; 14-16 one section of appendix; 17-19 one section of appendix; 20&amp;amp;21 appendix; 22&amp;amp;23 lymph nodes; 24&amp;amp;25 cervix; 26 lower segment; 27,28 endometrium; 29&amp;amp;30 right tube; 31 right ovary; 32,33 left tube; 34 left ovary; 35 rectal surgical margin; 36 RS from rectum; 37 tail of pancreas; 38&amp;amp;39 spleen; 40&amp;amp;41 diaphragm; 42,43 representative section of peritoneum; 44 representative section of omentum).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. D Asfour)
Sections of appendix show large mucin pools within which strips of low-grade mucin-secreting epithelium are identified. The epithelium shows basely located nuclei with  vacuolation of the cytoplasm and numerous goblet cells. Dystrophic calcification is identified. The wall of the appendix is disrupted and extracellular mucin is present on the serosal surface and within the fatty mesentery associated with chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Strips of epithelium are identified within the mucin outside the appendix. The serosal surface also shows focal reactive mesothelial proliferation.
Acellular mucin is identified on the serosal surface of the small bowel and large bowel at the resection margin.
No evidence of malignancy is seen in 7 lymph nodes identified.
Sections of the cervix show large Nabothian cysts. The endometrium shows disordered proliferative change. On the serosal surface of the right fallopian tube, extracellular acellular mucin is present. The right ovary also shows deposition of acellular mucin on the serosal surface associated with fibrous adhesion. Similar changes are identified on the serosal surface of the left tube and ovary. The left ovary also shows a follicular cyst.
The rectal serosal surface shows focal deposition of acellular mucin admixed with chronic inflammatory cells. Sections of pancreas show focal necrosis. The capsular surface of the spleen shows extensive deposition of acellular mucin.
The peritoneal tissue adjacent to the diaphragm shows extensive deposition of acellular mucin associated with congestion and reactive mesothelial proliferation. Mucin is also present within the representative sections of the omentum.
DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, RECTOSIGMOID, UTERUS, OVARIES, TAIL OF PANCREAS, DIAPHRAGM STRIPPING
- LOW-GRADE APPENDICEAL MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (LAMN).
- ACELLULAR MUCIN INVOLVING OMENTUM, PERITONEUM, SPLENIC CAPSULE, BOTH FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIAN SEROSA.
