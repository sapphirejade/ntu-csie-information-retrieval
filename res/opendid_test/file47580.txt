CLINICAL:
Papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to left lateral neck nodes.  Total thyroidectomy, central neck dissection and left neck dissection.  Stitch in sternocleidomastoid muscle.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left hemithyroid&amp;quot;, consists of a hemithyroid weighing 4.6g and measuring 40 x 20 x 13mm.  The outer surface is smooth in contour and coated in a thin fibrous capsule. The tracheal surface is inked black, the remainder inked blue.  On sectioning a circumscribed pale nodule is identified in the superior pole measuring 12mm in maximal dimension abutting the peripheral resection margin.  The remaining thyroid has a diffuse tan appearance and no other lesions are identified.  Block 1 - superior pole; 2-4 - remainder of lobe. AE.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right hemithyroid&amp;quot;, consists of a hemithyroid weighing 5.8g and measuring 48 x 27 x 15mm.  The outer surface has a regular contour and is coated in a thin fibrous capsule. The tracheal surface is inked black, the remainder inked blue.  On sectioning a circumscribed partially haemorrhagic and solid cream nodule is identified is identified measuring 11mm in maximal dimension.  The nodule abuts the peripheral resection margin.  Lobe serially sliced and AE 6 blocks (2 &amp;amp; 3 - include pale nodule).

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Central neck&amp;quot;, consists of an unoriented piece of fatty tissue measuring 45 x 25 x 10mm.  Multiple small lymph nodes are identified measuring up to 5mm in maximal dimension and possible glandular tissue measuring 20mm in maximal dimension are identified.
Block 1- possible glandular tissue; 2 - lymph nodes; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - remaining fat. AE.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left neck dissection level II&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 15 x 10mm.  Six possible lymph nodes are identified measuring 4 to 18mm in maximal dimension.  Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node per block bisected; 3 - four smaller nodes.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left neck dissection level III&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 23 x 20mm.  Four possible lymph nodes are identified measuring 5 to 13mm in maximal dimension.  Blocks 1 &amp;amp; 2- one lymph node per block bisected; 3 - remaining nodes.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left neck dissection level IV&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 35 x 15mm.  Two possible lymph nodes are identified measuring 3 to 5mm in maximal dimension. The remaining tissue appears vascular in appearance and no other lymph nodes are identified.  Block 1- lymph nodes as seen; 2 &amp;amp; 3- RS fibrovascular tissue.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left neck dissection level V&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 85 x 45 x 20mm with a suture at one end.  At the sutured end there is a firm nodule measuring 35 x 25 x 15mm.  On sectioning through the nodule underlying the sternocleidomastoid suture is a multiloculate cyst with a wall measuring up to 2mm thick and containing haemoserous fluid and chalky debris.  Further lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat.
Blocks 1-6 - majority of cyst wall embedded from suture to away from suture; 7 &amp;amp; 8 - nodes as seen.  RS.   (TO:AP/ec 3/8/68)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Albany):
A. The thyroid lobe is entirely embedded and examined. The 12mm nodule in the superior third of the lobe is a papillary carcinoma. The carcinoma in unencapsulated with a infiltrative profile and displays classic papillary, follicular as well tall cell architecture. The tall cell areas comprise approximately 40% of the tumour warranting designation as a tall cell variant (ie &amp;gt;30%). Mitoses number 2/10hpf and there is no necrosis.  There is focal focal associated psammomatous calcification. Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen. Perineural invasion is  not seen. The tumour is 0.1mm from both the anterolateral and posterior/tracheal margin with intervening fibrous tissue. Within the remainder of the lobe there are three separate small foci of papillary carcinoma ranging in size from 0.3mm to 1.3mm. These foci are well clear of the margins. Extrathyroidal extension is not seen. Lymph nodes and parathyroid glands are not identified. The background thyroid is multinodular with patchy Hurthle cell metaplasia.

B.  The 11mm nodule  is a papillary carcinoma with predominantly classic type with papillary and follicular architecture. Approximately 5% of the tumour shows tall cell features. The tumour is circumscribed but encapsulated and is less than 0.1 mm from the posterior/tracheal margin with intervening fibrous tissue and well clear of the anterolateral margin. Mitoses number 2 per 10hpf. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are not identified. Extrathyroidal extension is not seen. There is a second 0.3 mm focus of papillary carcinoma in the inferior pole which is  well clear of margins. Lymph nodes and parathyroid glands are not identified.  The background thyroid is predominantly non-nodular.

C. Two of three  lymph nodes contain metastatic papillary carcinoma (2/3). The deposits measure up to 2.5mm in each node and show classic features with cystic papillary architecture.  Extranodal extension is not seen. The specimen includes thymic remnants and three profiles of parathyroid tissue measuring 1.8mm and 4mm and 6.5mm. As the foci were not recognised grossly and are in different slices, it is difficult to determine if these are from one gland or separate glands.  A count of at least two glands is favoured.

D. Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/6).

E. One of four lymph nodes contain metastatic papillary carcinoma (1/4). The deposit  has  papillary cystic architecture, measures 10mm in maximum dimenstion and is associated with cholesterol clefts. Extrathyroidal extension is not seen.

F. One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).

G. The 35mm nodule described grossly is a deposit of classic type papillary carcinoma with predominantly cystic and focal papillary architecture. The deposit comprises a cyst which is predominantly lined by single layer of atypical cells subtended by a fibrous wall containing sparse residual portions of a lymph node parenchyma. The majority of the lymph node is replaced. The specimen includes an additional ten negative lymph nodes. The specimen includes medium sized nerves, striated muscle and perineural adipose tissue which is uninvolved.


DIAGNOSIS:
A - G. Left lobe of thyroid, right lobe of thyroid,  central neck, left level II - V neck dissection.
-  Left lobe, multifocal papillary carcinoma, largest  nodule 12mm in superior pole, tall cell variant, lymphovascular invasion present, perineural invasion not seen, extrathyroid extension not seen, margins clear (0.1mm), multinodular goitre.
-  Right lobe,  multifocal papillary carcinoima, largest nodule 11mm, classic type, focal tall cell features, lymphovascular invasion not identified, extrathyroid extension not seen, margins clear (less than  0.1mm)
-  Four of twenty five lymph nodes containing metastatic papillary carcinoma (4/25) (central neck, left level III and left level V involved), extranodal extension not seen.
-  Stage pT1b N1b (AJCC 8th Ed 2017).
-  Parathyroid glands in central neck, at least two glands favoured (see text)
