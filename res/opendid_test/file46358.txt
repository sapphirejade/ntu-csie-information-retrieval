CLINICAL:
Right colon cancer.  No family history.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right hemicolectomy&amp;quot;, consists of a right hemicolectomy received open.  The terminal ileum is 35mm x circumference 55mm.  The caecum is 22mm long.  The ascending colon is 90 x circumference 73mm.  The appendix is 70 x diameter 8mm.  The serosa shows a large multinodulated mass protruding through the bowel wall opposite the tumour on the postero-medial aspect of the bowel.  The protruding area measures 60 x 40 x 36mm.  It appears variegated with tan brown and cream coloured areas and appears to be covered in a thin layer of serosa.  Tumour perforation is uncertain.  The mesocolon is 80 x 55 x 13mm.  Inking proximal margin blue, distal margin black and the posterior non peritonealised surface of the bowel green.  Within the mucosa there is a circumferential tumour with an endophytic centre and a raised serpiginous border.  It is 40mm from the proximal margin and 25mm from the distal margin.  The dimensions of the mucosal tumour are 60 x 105mm circumferentially.  On sectioning the tumour appears to abut the circumferential margin.  Blocks: 1 - proximal and distal margins; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - appendix; 4 - two LS showing interface of normal mucosa to tumour; 5 &amp;amp; 6 - tumour at circumferential margin; 7 to 12 - tumour at serosa; 13 - apical tissue and apical node; 14 - six lymph nodes; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - four lymph nodes each; 17 - one lymph node quadrisected; 18 - one lymph node trisected; 19 - one lymph node quadrisected; 20 - one lymph node bisected; 21 &amp;amp; 22 - one lymph node quadrisected two pieces each block.  MMR ordered.  (TO:EX/eh 16/4/69)

ADDITIONAL REPORT (22/5/66)

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
