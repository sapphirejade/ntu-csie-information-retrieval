CLINICAL:
PreviousCRC.  Solitary right lobe liver met seg VI/VII.  Rectosigmoid tumour and appendix. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Liver", consists of a segment of unoriented liver measuring 130 x 50 x 90mm.  The serosal surface is shiny and smooth.  Surgical margin is inked blue. On sectioning there is a firm solid nodule measuring 15 x 15 x 7mm. Tumour is subcapsular and is located 20mm from the closest surgical margin. The rest of the parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.  Blocks 1 & 2- composite of tumour with closest surgical margin; 3 & 4- rest of tumour AE; 5 - 1 representative section of normal appearing liver.  (TO: DD: UE/ec   25.8.64) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Insco) 
The 15mm nodule in the liver is a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The circumscribed carcinoma is composed of tubular and cystically dilated cribriform glands garlanding necrosis, the latter comprising approximately 50% of the tumour volume.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen. The morphological features are consistent with a metastasis from a colorectal primary.  The tumour morphology and grade are similar to those seen in the previous excision specimen (rectosigmoid primary 96X38676).  The excision margin is about 20mm clear.  Away from the tumour the liver shows preserved lobular architecture and no significant abnormality.

DIAGNOSIS:
Liver:  
-  15mm deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with metastasis from a colorectal primary; margins clear.
