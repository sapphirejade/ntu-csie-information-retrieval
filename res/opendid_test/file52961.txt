FINDINGS / LESION:  A firm lesion is identified on the cut surface of slice 2 and 3 (lesion 1).  It measures 10mm superior to inferior x 10mm medial to lateral x 5mm anterior to posterior. The nodule is situated 5mm from anterior, 6mm from posterior, 20mm lateral and 25mm from medial.
A second lesion is identified extending from slice 5 to 10 which measures 30mm superior-inferior x 25mm medial-lateral x 7mm anterior-posterior. This lesion focally abut the posterior margin (slice 10) is 16mm from anterior, 7mm from posterior, 10mm from medial and 12mm from lateral.  The nodule is situated approximately 10mm from lesion 1.  Majority of the specimen is embedded as follows.
