CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma uterus.  Post menopausal bleeding.Aortic stenosis.  AF.  Breast cancer.  CAD.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 180g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 70 x 35mm and has a smoothshiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, uninvolved endometrium is 1mm thick and the myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  
The endometrial cavity is filled with a solid firm yellowish white tumour measuring 80 x 35 x 30mm.  The tumour is mainly located at the anterior endometrial wall extending inferiorly to the lower uterine segment. On sectioning, the tumour appears to be largely necrotic and it appears to invade into the inner half of the myometrium and is 5mm from the non-peritonealised anterior parametrial margin at the lower uterine segment and 10mm from the anterior serosa at the body.  The maximum depth of invasion appears to be 2mm where the myometrium thickness is 10mm. Within the lower uterine segment the tumour appears to invade into the inner half of the myometrium with the thickness of 3mm where the myometrium thickness is 15mm. Within the right anterior myometrium and subserosa is a pale white nodule, 6 x 3 x 6mm (?a satellite nodule or ?a fibroid), 2mm from the serosa.   
The right fallopian tube measures 45mm longand 5mm in diameter and the right ovary measures 15 x 11 x 5mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 30mm long and 3mm in diameter and the left ovary measures 15 x 11 x 5mm.  Sectioning of both ovaries appears to be unremarkable apart fromsome small cysts. The anterior soft tissue margin is inked blue and posterior soft tissue margin inked black.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 14 - left anterior wall (block 6, 9, 11, 14 - lower uterine segment); 15 & 16 - right anterior wall; 17 to 20 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 21 & 22 - right posterior wall (22 - lower uterine segment); 23 & 24 - left posterior wall (24 - lower uterine segment); 25 - left lower uterine segment posterior wall; 26 - left fimbria and tube; 27 - left ovary; 28 - right fimbria and tube; 29 - right ovary; 30 - tumour.  (TO: BRICE; THUKERI/ta 29/10/65); 
31 to 35 - left anterior cervix from midline to the periphery; 36 & 37 - right anterior cervix; 38 & 39 - right posterior cervix, serially embedded from midlineto periphery; 40 to 43 - left posterior cervix, serially embedded from midline to periphery; 44 & 45 - leftovary; 46 - left tube; 47 - right ovary; 48 - right tube.  (TO: SCOTT; Neville/rt 30.10.65)
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vaginal margin" consists of an elongated mucosa fragment, 9 x 3 x 2mm.  The deep surface is inked blue.  TAE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of an omental fat, 220 x 100 x 5mm.  There is no obvious tumour deposit.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Chioma):
A.  Sections show a carcinosarcoma / malignant mixed Mullerian tumour of the endometrium.  The tumour is composed of approximately 60% sarcoma (with heterologous elements including cartilage and bizarre multinucleated giant cells) and 40% carcinoma (mostly grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, with small foci of clear cell and serous carcinoma).  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 8mm through a wall 22mm thick.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved.  
No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
Both ovaries and tubes have been examined in their entirety.  Theleft ovary shows a small mixed serous and mucinous cystadenofibroma.  Both ovaries and tubes show no other significant abnormality.
The entire cervix has been examined. It is markedly ulcerated and inflamed.  The ectocervix shows atypia which is favoured as reactive and atrophic.  A p16 stain is negative.
B.  The vaginal biopsy is markedly ulcerated and inflamed. The remaining squamous epithelium shows atypia which is favoured as reactive and atrophic.  A p16 stain is negative.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The omentum shows noevidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Carcinosarcoma / MMMT of the endometrium, depth 8mm through a wall 22mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.  Omentum negative.
