Distribution:  
CLINICAL:
Ovarian cyst.  Right tube and ovary (sent for frozen section).  Left tube and ovary.  Cervix and uterus.  Omental biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an intact cyst 120 x 100 x 100mm with attached tube90 x 8mm.  The inner lining is smooth and filled with clear fluid.  Two representative sections for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section deblocked; 3 to 7 - representative cyst; 8 - fallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign serous cystadenoma.
Result to Anaesthetic fellow by Dr W Trimmer/RO at 11:59am on 05.11.2066
B.  Specimen labelled "Cervix and uterus" consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 51g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 40 x 20mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 2mm in thickness and the myometrium is up to 13mm in maximum thickness.
Blocks:   1 to 3 - full LS ofanterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a ovarian mass and attached fallopian tube measuring 130 x 100 x 90mm.  The ovarian mass has a smooth external surface and on sectioning the cyst is multiloculated with a smooth, internal lining.  The wall of the cyst is dark brown and haemorrhagic.  The fallopian tube measures 100 x 8mm in diameter.  There is a haemorrhagic nodule adjacent to the cyst appearing to rise from the adnexa.
Blocks:  1 to 9 - cyst wall; 10 - solid area; 11- fallopian tube.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 80 x 53 x 13mm.  A solid mass, lesion is not identified on sectioning.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (TO: FC; BU/rt 5.12.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Cavendish):
A.  Sections show a benign serouscystadenoma of the ovary.  The tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is atrophic and contains a benign sessile polyp.  The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show a torted ovarian cyst with extensive haemorrhage and infarction.  No viable epithelial lining is present for typing.  The tube is also torted.  There is no evidence of malignancy in this infarcted specimen.  
D.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Serous cystadenoma of the right ovary.  Torted left ovarian cyst and tube (see above).
