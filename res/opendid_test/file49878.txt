HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
MITCHELL HOSPITAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
R breast.
R axillary dissection.
(note: confirmed with Dr. Troy, patient has neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MC, AP Reg. 15/5/67).

MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;RIGHT BREAST TISSUE&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE:  Right
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Mastectomy with suture but no designation on request form or specimen container, taken as 12 o&amp;apos;clock.
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  No
HOOKWIRE:  No
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  190mm
Superior to inferior:  180mm
Anterior to posterior:  35mm
WEIGHT:  675g
SKIN:  Yes - 115x40mm
NIPPLE:  Yes - 16mm
MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES: N/A
MARGIN INKED: Non-standard: Anterior superior - blue; Anterior inferior - green; Posterior - black.
DISSECTION: Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION: The breast tissue is fibrofatty in appearance. There are areas with ectatic ducts extruding cream coloured material noted in the upper outer quadrant. No obvious tumour is noted macroscopically. Entire upper outer quadrant embedded.
(1 lateral half of nipple; 2-39 upper outer quadrant of anterior half, entirely embedded from lateral towards medial [please see diagram]; 40-77 upper outer quadrant, posterior half, embedded from lateral towards medial [please see diagram]). RS (M-77)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT AXILLARY CLEARANCE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 100x90x18mm. Fourteen possible lymph nodes are identified.
(1 three lymph nodes; 2 three nodes; 3 one node, bisected; 4 one node, bisected; 5 three nodes; 6 and 7 one node, bisected; 8 one node, bisected; 9 one node, bisected). RS (M-9/MC 15/4/2067 cy)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. Z. Tuzzo)
A-B. The entire outer upper quadrant has been examined.  There is a large zone of stromal changes including reactive fibroblasts, mild chronic inflammmation, dilated ducts containing foamy macrophages, stromal calcification, pigmented histiocytes and lobular atrophy (eg. blocks A16, A23, A55).  This zone probably represents the tumour bed and is estimated to be 25mm across.

Within this there zone there are 3 small clustered vessels which show intravascular carcinoma (block A60), with high nuclear grade.  Each cluster contains 15 to 20 cohesive tumour cells with focal suggestive of gland formation.

There is no residual intraductal or stromal invasive malignancy.

INVASIVE BREAST CANCER SYNOPTIC REPORT (Based on CAP 2017)
&amp;#160;
NUMBER OF INVASIVE FOCI:  No residual stromal invasive carcinoma found.
&amp;#160;
MAXIMUM INVASIVE TUMOUR SIZE: N/A
&amp;#160;
