Mean HER2 copy number per cell:  1.3
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell:  1.2
HER2/CEP17 Ratio:  1.1

SCORING CRITERIA (Update in line with ASCO/CAP recommendations 2013):
Negative: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;lt; 4.0
Equivocal:&amp;#160; HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;gt; or equal to 4.0 and &amp;lt; 6.0
