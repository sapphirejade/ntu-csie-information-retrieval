MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS WITH BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Specimen was received partially opened through the cervix. A uterus with attached cervix, tubes and ovaries measuring overall 120x80x50mm. The uterus is 80mm longitudinally, 50mm between the cornua and 33mm anteroposteriorly. The cervix is approximately 35x35mm in transverse section and 30mm in length. The anterior side is inked blue, the posterior side is inked black. There is a Mirena in-situ. The endometrium is approximately 2mm in thickness. There are no cysts or polyps in the cervix; There are two posterior cysts in the lower segment 1mm across. The anterior myometrium is up to 14mm in thickness and the posterior myometrium is up to 15mm in thickness. The right tube is 55mm in length, 5mm in diameter, and 20mm across the fimbria. There is one paratubal cyst 3mm in maximum dimension. The right ovary is 30x10x70mm. The left tube is 70mm in length, 5mm in diameter, and 20mm across the fimbria. There are two paratubal cysts measuring 6-7mm in maximum dimension each. The left ovary is 35x30x20mm including a cyst measuring 30x20x20mm, and containing haemorrhagic fluid. In the body of the uterus the endometrium appears slightly thickened up to 3mm in thickness which is less than 50% of the myometrium. There is one subserosal myoma anteriorly 7mm across.
(1 and 2 right tube and ovary [1 ovary, mid-tube and paratubal cyst; 2 distal tube, fimbria]; 3-7 left tube and ovary [3 mid-tube and paratubal cyst; 4 distal tube, fimbria; 5 and 6 representative ovary and cyst; 7 para-ovarian margin, soft tissue]; 8 right parametrial tissue; 9 left parametrial tissue; 10 and 11 right cornua, one section; 12 left cornua and myoma; 13-19 composite section [13 anterior cervix; 14 posterior cervix; 15 anterior lower segment; 16 posterior lower segment; 17 anterior myometrium; 18 posterior myometrium; 19 fundus]; 20 anterior cervix; 21 anterior lower segment; 22 posterior cervix; 23 posterior lower segment). Representative sections (M-23)
Further blocks: 24-31 remainder of the endometrium all embedded (M-31)
B. &amp;quot;PELVIC RIGHT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Fatty tissue 27x14x14mm, containing four grey nodules, ranging in maximal size from 5-10mm. One of the 5mm nodule is tinged blue. Nodules all embedded in one block. Representative sections (M-1)
C. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Fatty tissue 19x11x8mm, containing a grey nodule 10x8x4mm, in Block 1, a blue tinged grey nodule 5mm across, in Block 2. Remainder fatty tissue all embedded in Block 3. All embedded. (M-3)
D. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Fatty tissue 27x14x7mm. All embedded. (1-1 FR 7/7/2070 cy)

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT  (15/7/2068)

Immunostains for MMR proteins:
MLH1:  Positive
PMS2:  Positive
MSH2:  Positive
MSH6:  Positive

Comment:
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
