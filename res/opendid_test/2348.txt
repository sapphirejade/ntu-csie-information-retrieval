CLINICAL:
Multiple lipomas - (L) elbow, back, (R) perianal.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Lipoma left antecubital fossa" consists of a lobulated encapsulated piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 40 x 24 x 15mm.  The cut surface shows a homogenous pale yellow surface.  Representative in 2 blocks.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Lipoma from back" consists of a lobulated thinly encapsulated piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 13mm.  The cut surface shows a homogenous pale yellow cut surface.  Representative in 2 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Lipoma right buttock" consists of a lobulated piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 42 x 25 x 20mm.  There is an unoriented ellipse of skin on the surface measuring 17 x 5mm.  The cut surface shows a homogenous pale yellow cut surface.  Representative in 2 blocks.  (TO: XK:  DI/mm 21.7.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr J Milinazzo)
A - C.  Specimens A - C show similar histopathological features. Sections show lobules of mature adipose tissue. There is mild variation in adipocyte size. There is no significant cytologic atypia and no lipoblasts are seen. In the appropriate clinical context, the features would be consistent with lipoma(s). There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Lesions left antecubital fossa, back and right buttock: Consistent with lipomas.
