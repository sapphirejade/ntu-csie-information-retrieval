CLINICAL:
Prev R nephrectomy for RCC.  Now solitary ?met in L adrenal gland.  Ladrenalectomy.  CRF.  RCC.  Gout.  HTN
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left adrenal gland", consists of an adrenal gland with surrounding adipose tissue, 110 x 70 x 30mm, weighing 69g in total.  The adrenal gland is 40 x 14 x 30mm.  Within the adrenal gland is a circumscribed tan tumour, 21 x 15 x 25mm.  The tumour abuts the overlying peritonealised surface.  The peritonealised surface is inked blue and the opposite surface black.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - cross section through tumour with overlying peritoneum; 3 and 4 - paired sections through tumour; 5 - uninvolved adrenal; 6 - further section of tumour.
(TO: RO;DN/vo 20.11.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Roundy):
The adrenal gland contains a circumscribed 25mm deposit of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with similar morphology to the previously resected right kidney tumour (97U40563).  The tumour is composed of large epithelioid cells with abundant clear cytoplasm arranged in nests surrounded by fine fibrovascular septae.  The nuclei are rounded with occasional small nucleoli.  No rhabdoid or sarcomatoid features are seen.  No necrosis or lymphovascularinvasion is identified.  The tumour cells show diffuse positive staining for CD10 and negative staining with inhibin.  The carcinoma is 1mm clear of the closest inked surface.  The uninvolved adrenal gland shows no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left adrenal gland:  Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
