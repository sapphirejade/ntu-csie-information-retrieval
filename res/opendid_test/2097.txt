CLINICAL:
Left breast DCIS 2 o'clock 7cm from nipple.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Lesion left breast, sutureslong lateral, short superior, double deep" consists of an irregularly shaped fibrofatty tissue oriented with sutures measuring 50mm (superficial to deep) x 30mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (medial to lateral) and weighing 16.3g.  There are three sutures in place.  There is a hookwire entering from the superficial surface.  X-ray shows a clip in-situ the surface tissue of which is marked with green ink.  The superior surface is inked red with a small focal area of green, lateral surface is inked blue, medial surface is inked black.  The medial and lateral ink converged in the inferior part of the specimen.  It has been sliced into nine slices from deep to superficial.  The cut surface shows uniform fibrofatty tissue.  No focal lesion is seen.  The hookwire terminates in slice number three.  The clip is not identified grossly but X rays of the blocks show the clip is present in block 4..  AE.
Blocks:  1 - slice one; 2 - slice two; 3 - slice three; 4 - slice four; 5 - slice five; 6 - slice six; 7 - slice seven; 8 - slice eight; 9 to 10 - slice nine.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Sitsler):
The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show a 4.5mm focus of intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with cribriform and solid architecture associated with both necrosis and microcalcification. A preserved investing myoepithelial layer is demonstrated with P63 and CK6/5 immunostains. There are stromal changes consistent with previous core biopsy sampling.  The margins of excision of DCIS are as follows:  
Margins:
Medial:  3mm (block 7)
Lateral:  5mm (block 7)
Inferior:  6mm (block 7)
Superior, superficial and deep:  Wellclear (>10mm)
Elsewhere there are multiple foci of benign glandular calcifications, foci of columnar cell change and focal columnar cell hyperplasia, florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type and benign papillary apocrine metaplasia.   Fibroadenomatoid change of lobules is also seen.  No evidence of invasive malignancy is seen.  


DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast 2 o'clock 7cm from nipple (hookwire excision):
- 4.5mm focus of intermediate grade DCIS associated with calcifications and necrosis.
- Multiple foci of calcifications associated with benign glands with DCIS, margins clear.
