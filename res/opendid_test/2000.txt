Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Recurrence in the right upper quadrant.  Ovarian cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right diaphragmatic mass", consists of a well demarcated grey coloured nodule with attached fat measuring 110 x 85 x 85mm.  The outer surface is inked blue.  Serially TS.  The cut surface reveals an extensively necrotic mass surrounded by fat measuring 60mm in maximum dimension.  Viable tumour is 20mm in maximum dimension.  The surgical margins appear clear of the tumour. Block 1-11 - representative section of the tumour. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Transverse colonpseudocapsule", consists of a piece of fibrous tissue 12 x 7 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Umbilical hernia", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 20 x 15 x 10mm.  TAE 1 block. (TO: Carranco/ec  25.12.64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Cirillo) 
A.  Sections showa poorly differentiated Mullerian adenocarcinoma.  The tumour is extensively necrotic.  Most of the tumour has serous carcinoma features.  Probable focal clear cell carcinoma features are also noted.  The tumour is surrounded by fibrofattytissue.  The main tumour mass appears clear of the margins by 0.5mm.  There is one positive lymph node, and several foci of lymphvascular invasion.  A small portion of adherent liver is noted.  The carcinoma does not invade the hepatic tissue.
B.  Sections show reactive changes.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Recurrent poorly differentiated Mullerian adenocarcinoma involving the right upper quadrant.
ADDITIONAL REPORT:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins wereperformed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
