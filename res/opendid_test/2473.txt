CLINICAL:
Caecal cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of a specimen of terminal ileum (55mm in length), caecum and ascending colon (260mmin length) and pericolonic fatty tissue (up to 50mm across).  The vermiform appendix is not identified.  Within the caecum there is a raised polypoid tumour 42 x 25 x 10mm.  The tumour has solid pale cut surfaces.  The caecum appears to be peritonealised.  The serosa overlying the tumour is puckered.  The tumour is 95mm from proximal and well clear of the distal resection margins.  The tumour is well clear ofthe ileal mesenteric and pericolonic fat resection margins.  The puckered serosa over along the tumour is inked blue.  Distal and proximal resection margins are inked black.  There are several lymph nodes ranging from 3 to 15mm in maximum dimension. 
The specimen is re-examined for lymph nodes.  One likely lymph node is identified.  
Blocks: 1 - shave proximal margin; 2  - shave distal margin; 3 and 4 - paired sections TS of tumour and puckered serosa; 5 - TS of tumour and puckered serosa; 6 - TS tumour and puckered serosa including adjacent normal looking mucosa; 7 - the apical lymph node trisected; 8 - one trisected lymph node; 9 - lymph nodes as seen; 10 - one trisected lymph node; 11 - one bisected lymph node; 12 - lymph nodes as seen; 13 - ?lymph node bisected; 14 to 17 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Grawburg):
Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  The features are as follows:  

Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Caecum	
Maximum tumour diameter:  42mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  95mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria
 
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved 
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  12	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumourstatus
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Preserved nuclearstaining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
