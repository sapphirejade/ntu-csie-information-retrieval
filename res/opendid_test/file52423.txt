SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  110mm
Superior to inferior:  65mm
Anterior to posterior:  60mm
WEIGHT:  115.5g
SKIN:  Ellipse of skin anteriorly 110x50mm
NIPPLE:  13mm across
MUSCLE:  No
MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior (skin) blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from lateral to medial
Number of slices: 15
FINDINGS / LESION:  Within slice 2-8 there is a cavity surrounding with granulation tissue, fat, fibrosis measuring 25mm medial to lateral, 35mm superior to inferior and 30mm anterior to posterior.  No definite tumour present.  The cavity abuts the skin and is about 5mm from superior, 5mm from inferior, 7mm from posterior and more than 10mm from medial and lateral margins.

(1 two LS from slice 1; 2&amp;amp;3 slice 2; 4&amp;amp;5 slice 4; 6&amp;amp;7 slice 6; 8&amp;amp;9 slice 8; 10&amp;amp;11 slice 10; 12 LS from slice 11).  RS (M-12/SM 5/4/2071 ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr L Spade)
A.  The sections show skin including nipple with underlying breast tissue, with breast ducts and lobules showing epithelial hyperplasia and columnar cell change.  There is also a biopsy cavity with fat necrosis and fibroblastic reaction.  Focally, there is residual intermediate nuclear grade ductal carcinoma in-situ in ducts adjacent to the biopsy cavity (block A5).  Ductal carcinoma in-situ measures 5mm in extent and is 11mm from the posterior margin and is 16mm from the inferior margin.
Sections of the nipple appear unremarkable.
B.  The sections show breast tissue with patchy duct dilatation and periductal chronic inflammation.  Negative for ductal carcinoma in-situ and negative for invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  LEFT CENTRAL MASTECTOMY:
-   FOCAL RESIDUAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU -  SEE TEXT FOR DETAILS
B.  FURTHER SUPERIOR MARGIN:
-  BENIGN BREAST TISSUE
