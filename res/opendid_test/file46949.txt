MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus tubes plus ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of an opened distorted uterus with bilateral fallopian tube and ovaries 49g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 40 x 27mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 38 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm and maximum thickness in the myometrium is 70mm in maximum thickness.  They myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 15 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 55mm in length by 10 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 - five TS of right ovary; 8 - three TS of right ovary and two TS of right tube; 9 - six TS of right tube; 10 - two LS of fimbriae and four TS of right tube; 11 - five TS of left ovary; 12 - two TS of left ovary and three TS of left tube; 13 - six TS of left tube; 14 - two TS of left tubes and two LS of fimbriae; 15 - remaining periadnexal structures.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Peritoneum biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of pale sheet-like tissues measuring 20 x 15 x 3mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block.  (TO:ZG/rs 18/9/69)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Koc):
A. The ovaries and fallopian tubes have been all embedded. There is no evidence of malignancy.

The endometrium is in the proliferative phase. Superficial adenomyosis is present in the myometrium. The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN.

B. Sections show a multiloculated cyst lined by a single-layer of benign mesothelium, in keeping with a mesothelial cyst. There is no evidence of malignancy.
