CLINICAL:
Vulval cancer.  SCC vulva.  Hypertension.  Appendicectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node" and consists of fatty tissue 35 x 27 x 10mm.  A lymph node, 25 x 12 x 8mm is identified.  Bisected.  Half for frozen section in 2 blocks. 
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 - other half of the lymph node; 4 & 5 - residual fat composite sections; 6 & 7 - residual fat.  AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Reactive lymph node.  
Result to Dr DYLAN Durney by Dr T Henrichsen at 3:23 on 10/05/65.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulval stitch at 12 o'clock" and consists of a partial vulvectomy, 36 x 56mm to a depth of 27mm.  At one endthere is a suture denoting 12 o'clock.  Centrally there is a polypoid tumour with central previous biopsy site, 36 x 28mm.  The tumour appears to extend to the deep/underlying fatty tissue.  The closest deep margin is 10mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 13 - 12 o'clock margin, serially embedded from 3 to 9 o'clock; 14 to 16 -TS (block 14 - 2 o'clock; 15 - tumour, 16 - 10 o'clock); 17 to 24 - two TS (block 17 & 21 - from 3 o'clock; 18& 19, 22 & 23 - composite sections nick at the midline; 20 & 24 -  9 o'clock margin); 25 to 39 - three TS (block 25 & 26, 31 & 30, 36 & 35 are composite sections of the 3 to 4 o'clock margin, superficial half embedded first followed by the deep half, 28 & 27, 32 & 33, 37 & 38 - composite sections of the tumour, superficial half embedded first followed by the deep half); 40 to 56 - 6 o'clock margin, serially embedded from 4 to 8 o'clock.  AE.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral groin node" and consists of fatty tissue measuring 79 x 25 x 6mm.  Three nodes identified, measuring 10 to 28mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one node bisected; 2 - one node bisected; 3 & 4 - one node half in each block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Large femoral lymph node" and consists of fatty tissue with blood vessel, 15 x 10 x 2mm.  Definitive lymph node cannot be identified.  
Blocks: 1 AE.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left medial groin" and consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 36 x 30 x 17mm.  Two possible nodes are identified, 8mm and 6mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one node bisected; 2 - one node bisected; 3 - ?lymph node.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral groin node" and consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 25 x 6mm.  Three possible nodes are identified, 2 to 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one node bisected each block.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right medial groin node" and consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40 x 36 x 17mm.  Eight possible nodes identified measuring 2 to 35 x 15 x 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one node bisected; 2 - one node bisected; 3 - four nodes; 4 - one node bisected; 5 to10 - largest node sectioned (block 6 & 7, 9 & 10 - composite sections).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Cam):
A.  Sections show a lymph node.  The node is focally involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  This consists of cords of cells between follicles and the deposit measures 7mm in maximum diameter.  There is no extranodal spread.  In retrospect there is tumour focally present in the frozen section slides but it is much more evident and extensive in the subsequent paraffin sections.
B.  Sections show a welldifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma of vulva arising in lichen sclerosus.  The tumour has an infiltrative appearance.  There is multifocal perineural invasion within the tumour and at the advancing tumour edge.  There is also very focal lymphovascular invasion (block B24).  Maximum depth of tumour invasion is 15mm.  There is focal differentiated VIN identified adjacent to the tumour (block B34).
All excision margins are free of tumour.  The tumour is >10mm fromthe 12 o'clock margin and is around 10mm from the right and left lateral margins.  It is 4mm from the deep margin and from the 6 o'clock margin.  No definite VIN is identified at excision margin.
C.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No lymph node is seen.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
F.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
G.  Sections show eight lymph nodes.  There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma extensively involving the largest node.  The nodal deposit measures up to 20mm in main dimension.  There is focal extranodal spread.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.Left medial inguinal lymph node:  Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (1/1).
B.  Anterior vulva:  Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

C.  Right lateral groin nodes:  No tumour (0/3).

D.  Femorallymph node:  No lymph node, no tumour.
E.  Left medial groin nodes:  No tumour (0/2).

F.  Left lateral groin nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
G.  Right medial groin nodes:  Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma inone node (1/8), with focal extranodal spread.
