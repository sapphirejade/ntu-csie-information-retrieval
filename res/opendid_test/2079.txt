CLINICAL:
Re-excision right breast Ca + axillary lymph node clearance.  Prior excision of multifocal lobular carcinoma - positive margin at deep/inferior junction.  SLNBx positive.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled " Right breast tissue. stitch long lateral medium medial short deep", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with overlying skin and orientating sutures.  Thespecimen is 120mm (medial to lateral) x 95mm (superficial to deep) x 34mm (superior to inferior).  The ellipse of skin is 120 x 26mm and has a linear longitudinal scar.  The superior margin is inked blue and inferior black.  At the deeplateral aspect of the specimen is a disrupted unilocular cavity 32 x 25 x 15mm.  The cavity is present in slices 12 to 19.  Within the superficial half of slices 3 to 16 are areas of yellow discolouration consistent with fat necrosis.Also received is an axillary dissection 175 x 125 x 30mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 25mm across.  There is an area of fat necrosis at one end of the axillary dissection. 
Blocks: 1 and 2 - sliceone medial margin; 3 and 4 - slice three; 5 to 7 - slice five; 8 to 11 - slice seven; 12 to 16 - slice nine; 17 to 21 - slice eleven; 22 to 25 - slice twelve; 26 to 31 - slice thirteen; 32and 33 - cavity slice fourteen; 34 to 40 - slice fifteen; 41 to 43 - cavity slice sixteen; 44 to 47 - cavity slice seventeen; 48 and 49 - cavity slice eighteen 50 to 54 - slice nineteen lateral margin; 55 and 56 - one lymph node; 57 and 58 - one lymph node; 59 and 60 - one lymph node in each block; 61 to 69 - multiple lymph nodes.  Breast cavity AE.  Please see block diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof F Rumbaugh):
The breast cavity has been embedded in its entirety. The sections show organising fat necrosis and fibrosis consistent with previous surgery.
Extensive, multiple foci of residual lobular neoplasia (lobular carcinoma in situ) are present within slices 9 through to 19 (lateral most slice).
LCIS extends to the blue inked, superior margin and the black inked,inferior margin in multiple blocks. LCIS also extends to the lateral margin. 
A subtle, 1.1mm focus of residual invasive lobular carcinoma is present in slice 13 (block 29) and is situated 1.5mm from the inferior (black) margin. Other microscopic foci of invasive lobular carcinoma are seen in association with a focus of LCIS over an area of approximately 4mm. This area is 5mm from the superior margin (Slice 15, block 36).
Slice 17 (block 45) contains further foci of invasive tumour, including a 7mm area associated with LCIS. Other microscopic invasive foci are present within this section, including a 2.5mm focus which extends to the diathermied inferior margin. Invasive carcinoma extends to within 0.1mm of the inferior/lateral margin in slice 19 (block 52).

Multiple foci of columnar cell hyperplasia and adenosis are present in the surrounding breast tissue.
The axillary lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy in the H&E stained sections (0/34). However, given the very subtle, histiocyte-like appearance of the tumour cells within the breast tissue, keratin stains are in progress on all nodes for confirmation of the nodalstatus.
Two additional lymph nodes are present in the breast tissue and both are negative (0/2).
DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY: 
RIGHT BREAST: 
	ORGANISING EXCISION CAVITY
	EXTENSIVE RESIDUALLOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU WITH NUMEROUS AREAS OF MARGIN INVOLVEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT OF LATERAL MOST SLICE
	MULTIPLE FOCI OF RESIDUAL INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA WITH FOCAL INVOLVEMENT OF INFERIOR MARGIN AND VERY CLOSE CLEARANCE AT LATERAL MARGIN.

LYMPH NODES: 
	NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN A TOTAL OF 36 LYMPH NODES
	KERATIN STAINS IN PROGRESS.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: 
Keratin stains were performed on all lymph nodes and these additional studies are negative and show no evidence of malignancy.
