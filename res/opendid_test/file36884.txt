MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RECTAL WALL&amp;quot;. Two pieces of tissue 2 and 8mm. Embedded as whole for frozen.

F/S : &amp;quot; Adenocarcinoma&amp;quot;. Reported to Fellow by Dr. B. Nagano at 1.10pm on 25.06.69.

(1 FS). AE (2-1)

B.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, SPLEEN, PERITONEAL DISEASE, UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, DIAPHRAGM, RECTOSIGMOID COLON, RECTUM&amp;quot;.  Multiple pieces of tissue with
variable involvement by multiple firm white tumour deposits and extensive thick yellow exudates including;

A spleen 178g, measuring 145x95x40mm.  The outer surface has multiple minute white nodules 2-3mm.  The cut surface is red and unremarkable.

(1&amp;amp;2 spleen with overlying capsule; 3 spleen at hilum)

A hysterectomy specimen with adnexal structures and peritoneal strips, 364g in total and 172g without strips, consists of a uterus 95x70x45mm with attached right fallopian tube 65x15mm, right ovary adherent to the tube 25x25x20mm, left fallopian tube 45x20mm and adherent left ovary 30x25x20mm.  Attached anteriorly and posteriorly peritoneal strips 145x110x10mm and 110x60x20mm respectively. The anterior margin is inked blue posterior black. The serosal surfaces are ragged and covered by thick yellow exudates and have scattered firm white tumor deposits. The endometrium is up to 3mm thick. The myometrium is trabeculated and up to 20mm thick. One intramural fibroid is identified at the left body 18mm in maximum diameter with white whorled cut surface.  The outer and cut surface of both right adnexal structures are unremarkable. The cut surface of the left tube is unremarkable. The cut surface of the left ovary reveals firm white areas, cystic spaces filled with yellow gelatinous material and possible bony strurctures .

(4 anterior and posterior cervix; 5-7 anterior body isthmus to fundus; 8-10 posterior body isthmus to fundus; 11 fibroid; 12&amp;amp;13 right tube fimbrial end; 14 TS right ovary and tube; 15 left fallopian tube fimbrial end; 16-18 RS left ovary; 19 peritoneal involvement with Pouch of Douglas; 20&amp;amp;21 RS peritoneal involvement)

Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue, the largest fragment is omentum 290x150x70mm with extensive involvement by firm white tumour (omental cake) involving up to 60% of the submitted specimen. The other fibrofatty pieces of tissue include peritoneal strips measuring 225x230x85mm in aggregate with variable involvement by tumour deposits 5-10mm.

(23&amp;amp;24 omental cake [24 tumour block for tissue banking]; 25-27 RS other peritoneal strip involvement; 28 tubular structure with adjacent tumour deposit)

Three segments of bowel, short segment 65x35mm with mesentery up to 25mm.  A section of large bowel 230x45mm with mesocolon up to 65mm and possible rectum 50x30mm with mesorectum up to 35mm.  The former two segments have extensive overlying adhesions, thick white exudates and multiple overlying tumour deposits but no intraluminal tumours are identified.

(29&amp;amp;30 TS across the smaller segment; 31 proximal and distal margins; 32&amp;amp;33 serosal involvement; 34 mesocolon; 35 RS rectal ; 36&amp;amp;37 each five lymph nodes left colon)

A right hemicolectomy specimen consists of terminal ileum 75x35mm, caecum and ascending colon 110x75mm, mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 90mm.  Multiple peritoneal strips are identified 130x70x15mm.  At the anatomical site of the appendix there is a ragged haemorrhagic cavity adjacent to a mass measuring 50x35x30mm with extensive thick white exudates on the overlying serosa and within the cavity lining.  Serial slicing reveals a tumour arising from the appendix involving the full length of appendix 50mm and extending into the overlying serosa and the mesoappendix. It is invading the fatty tissue to approach the mucosal surface of the caecum. No other tumors or polyps are identified.

(38 proximal and distal margins; 39 vessel adjacent to appendix; 40&amp;amp;41 continuous [40  LS appendiceal orifice with caecal mucosa; 41 LS base] ; 42&amp;amp;43 continuous slices TS mid appendix; 44 LS tip; 45 caecal mucosa; 46 three lymph nodes; 47 four lymph nodes; 48 four lymph nodes; 49 four lymph nodes).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr B Lundblad)
A.  Paraffin sections confirm the frozen diagnosis of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue.

B.  Sections show widely metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the appendix.  The adenocarcinoma arises in the proximal appendix just beyond the appendiceal orifice of the caecum.  The carcinoma extends through the full thickness of the wall of the appendix including mesoappendix with subserosal and meso-appendageal deposits of carcinoma throughout the length of the appendix, beyond the mucosal lesion. These deposits are admixed with pockets of suppuration and there is extensive peritonitis in keeping with perforation, although the site of perforation is not apparent in the sections. The carcinoma also infiltrates extensively deep to the mucosa of the caecum and focally replaces the caecal mucosa. Four of fourteen pericolic lymph nodes show involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma (right hemicolectomy) segment. Lymphovascular space invasion is not seen.

There is widespread serosal and subserosal involvement of all of the additional segments of small and large bowel by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  There is no evidence of mucosal involvement of these segments.  Numerous deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma are also identified in excised peritoneal strips and omentum.  There are deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the posterior and anterior aspects of the uterus and the capsule of the spleen.  The left ovary shows extensive involvement by metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Sections of the splenic parenchyma are unremarkable.

Sections of the cervix show transformation zone.  There is no evidence of squamous or glandular atypia.  The sampled endometrium is inactive and a benign leiomyoma is confirmed.  The right ovary shows morphology consistent with age.  Sections of bilateral fallopian tubes show oedema and peritonitis, but no evidence of malignancy.

ANCILLARY STUDIES;
Immunostains Block B41
CK7, CK20: Negative
CDX2: Positive
The CK20 negative status is unusual (but possible)  for colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Immunostains for MSI proteins
MLH1:  Positive (intact)
PMS2:  Positive (intact)
MSH2:  Positive (intact)
MSH6:  Positive (intact)
Comment:
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
