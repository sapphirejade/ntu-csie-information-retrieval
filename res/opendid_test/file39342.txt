CLINICAL NOTES:
Rectal Ca 2016 peritonectomy.  Hartmann&amp;apos;s.  Stoma site recurrence.
Old stoma site

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OLD STOMA SITE&amp;quot;.  A stomal opening site comprising of a segment of small bowel with attached rim of skin and mesentery.  It measures 65mm in length.  The rim of skin is up to 12mm wide.  The attached mesentery is up to 80mm wide.  The margin opposite the stomal opening site is stapled.  This is trimmed off and margin inked blue.  The radial resection margin is inked green.  There is a firm area adjacent to the rim of skin within the fatty tissue, there are multiple deposits of mucinous tumour coming up to the inked margin.  The largest dimension is 25mm.  It is 25mm from the blue inked margin.  The mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.

(1&amp;amp;2 composite slice of one tumour; 3&amp;amp;4 composite slice of second tumour; 5 blue inked margin; 6 possible lymph nodes within mesentery).  RS (M-6/MC 20/11/2067 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr L Pantaleo)
Sections show a mucinous adenocarcinoma in the fibroadipose tissue deep to the stomal squamomucosal junction. It has a similar morphology to the previously resected colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma in specimen 48M33168. The tumour extends to the radial resection margin of the adipose tissue focally. It is well clear (&amp;gt;10mm) of the enteric margin.

One lymph node with no evidence of malignancy is identified. There is an extranodal deposit of adenocarcinoma measuring 10mm in the mesenteric fat. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified in the sections examined. Clinical correlation is recommended.

DIAGNOSIS:
OLD STOMA SITE -
- MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA
