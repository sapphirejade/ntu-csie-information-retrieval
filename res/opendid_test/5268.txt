CLINICAL:
Distal pancreatectomy with spleen.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Distal pancreas plus splenectomy", consists of a distal pancreas with attached spleen and omentum.  The pancreas measures 70mm x 40mm x 30mm.  The spleen measures 90mm x 70mm x 40mm.  The omentum measures 200mm x 190 x 60mm.  The anterior surface is inked blue and the posterior surface is inked black and superior surface is inked red.  On sectioning there is a circumscribed nodule with haemorrhage and cystic areas measuring 24 x 12 x 10mm.  The lesion abuts the anterior surface, lies 10mm from the posterior surface, 18mm from the superior margin and 9mm from the inferior surface.  The pancreatic resection margin is well clear.  The rest of the pancreas is unremarkable.  Sections of the spleen are unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 10 - longitudinal sections of resection margin; 11 to 14 - longitudinal section of the pancreas at the pancreatic splenic junction; 15 and 16 - representative sections of spleen; 17 to 23 - all of the pancreasincluding the lesion from the resection margin to the opposite end; 24 - one lymph node.  (BU/vo 10.5.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Perrin & registrar Dr E Zimbelman):
Sections show a 15mm grade 1 neuroendocrine tumour.  The tumour has a thick capsule and consists of tumour cells arranged in cords and nests with granular cytoplasm and uniform nuclei.  The tumour cells show strong positive staining with CD56 and chromogranin.  Thereis patchy staining with synaptophysin.  Mitoses are difficult to identify and the Ki67 index is less than 2%.  Scattered tumour cells are present within vascular spaces within the capsule of the tumour.  The tumour abuts the anterior surface of the pancreas however, appears completely excised.  The posterior surface is 13mm clear, the inferior surface 8mm clear, the superior surface 13mm clear and the pancreatic resection margin is well clear. 
The remainder of thepancreas shows foci of chronic pancreatitis and an occasional foci of mucinous metaplasia consistent with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1A (PanIN1A).
The ten (10) peripancreatic and splenic hilar lymph nodes show no significant abnormality and the spleen appears unremarkable. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Distal pancreas and splenectomy:
-   Grade 1 neuroendocrine tumour, excision appears complete. 
-   10 negative lymph nodes.
