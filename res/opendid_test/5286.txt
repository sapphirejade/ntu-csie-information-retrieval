CLINICAL:
Right leg low grade sarcoma.  Diagnosed with deep cellular dermatofibroma by expert opinion.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Tumour right lower leg long 12 o'clock short 3 o'clock", consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 133mm x 53mm to a depth up to 16mm.  Orienting sutures are insitu.  On the skin surface, is an ellipsoid scar, with each long edge measuring 93mm in length.  The scar has a width of 3 to 4mm.  The scar is clear of all surgical margins by at least 9mm.  The skin surface is otherwise unremarkable.  The 12 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 6 o'clock margin is inked black.  The cut surface has a fibrofatty appearance; no tumour is identified macroscopically.  RS.
Blocks: 1 - LS 9 o'clock; 2 3 o'clock; 3 to 22 - Representative slices from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock (blocks 3 and 4 composite slice one, 5 and 6 composite slice four, 7 and 8 - composite slice six; 9 and 10 - composite slice nine; 11 and 12 - composite slice 10; 13 and 14 - composite slice eleven; 15 and 16 - composite slice fourteen; 17 and 18 - composite slice seventeen; 19 and 20 - composite slice twenty; 21 and 22 - composite slice twenty two); 23 & 24 - slice twelve; 25 & 26 & 27 - composite slice thirteen.   Please refer to block diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Gendron):
Sections show an area of scar tissue involving deep dermis and subcutis, in keeping with previous surgery.  There is marked fibrosis with focal areas of foreign body reaction and fat necrosis.  In slice 11 (block 14), there is a focus of residual spindle cell tumour at the deep aspect of scar tissue measuring 6mm in diameter.  The tumour shows short spindle cells with mild cytological atypia.  The appearances are consistent with the previous diagnosis of atypical (deep) cellular dermatofibroma/low grade myofibroblastic sarcoma.The tumour is incompletely excised.  The tumour focally extends to the diathermied deep margin over a 1mm linear area (block 14).  The lateral margins are well clear.
Comment:
Please see the previous report (82M47502) for detailed discussion and examination of the tumour.
DIAGNOSIS:
Tumour right lower leg - Residual spindle cell tumour (see text for margins).
