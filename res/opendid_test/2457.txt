CLINICAL:
Left breast wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy axilla.  Stitch short superior, medium medial, long lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node" consists of two pieces of lymph node and attached fatty tissue measuring 40 x 25 x 10mm and 10 x 7 x 6mm.  There is apale area in the larger lymph node 2mm in maximum dimension (?metastasis).  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 to 4 - one lymph node.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast lesion" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches measuring 55mm (lateral to medial) x 30mm (superior to inferior) x 55mm (superficial todeep).  There is a 50 x 7mm skin ellipse on the superficial aspect.  There are no lesions on the skin surface.  The margins are inked in three colours, superior - blue, inferior - red, and deep - black.  Specimen is serially sectioned into eight slices from lateral to medial.  Extending from slice three to slicefive there is an ill defined pale solid tumour measuring 15 x 12 x 12mm.  The tumour is 22mm from superficial, 10mm from superior, 6mm from inferior, 17mm from deep, 12mm from lateral and 18mm from medial margins.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - slice one (lateral); 4 to 6 - slice two; 7 to 9 - slice three (8 - reserve block); 10 to 12 - slice four; 13 to 15 - slice five; 16 to 18 - slice six; 19 & 20 - slice seven; 21 to 23 - slice eight (medial).  AE.  Please see diagram.
