CLINICAL:
Pregnant.  Biopsy proven left breast cancer + sentinel nodes.  Vertical wedge.  Loop superior.  Single lateral.  Double deep.  Margins in mm.  TOP.  Products of conception.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Sentinel 1" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35mm.  One lymph node is identified measuring 13mm in maximum dimension.  Serially sectioned.  AE 1 block.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel 2" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35mm in maximum dimension.  Five lymph nodes are identified from 3 to 25mm.  Each piece serially sectioned AE 5blocks, (one node per block).
C.  Specimen labelled "Left breast tissue" consists of an orientate wide local excision measuring 45mm (medial to lateral) x 70mm (inferior to superior) x 75mm (superficial to deep).  There is an overlying irregular triangle of skin measuring 22mm (medial to lateral) x 65mm(inferior to superior).  Three sutures are in situ as designated.  The lateral margin is inked black, medial margin blue and the deep aspect red.  Specimen is serially sectioned in the transverse plane into eleven slices, from slice one superior to slice eleven inferior.  A firm cream relatively well circumscribed lesion is identified in slices one to seven.  The tumour measures 26mm (medial to lateral) x 35mm (inferior to superior) x 26mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is as follows:  medial margin - 5mm, lateral margin - 7mm, deep margin - 22mm, superior margin - 10mm and well clear of the inferior margin well clear of the inferior margin.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - slice one; 5 & 6 - slice two; 7 & 8 - slice three; 9 to12 - slice four; 13 to 16 - slice five; 17 & 18 - slice six; 19 & 20 - slice seven; 21 - slice eight; 22 - slice ten; 23 & 24 - slice eleven.  Please refer to attached diagram.  
    
D.  Specimen labelled "Products of conception" consists of haemorrhagic and tan tissue measuring 60 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  No vesicles are identified.  Placental type tissue is seen.  Representative sections 1 block.   (TO: DT/ta 6/8/64)

- 30mm intermediate grade DCIS
- Isolated tumour cells in 1 out of 5 sentinel lymph nodes, no extranodal spread
D. Products of conception.
