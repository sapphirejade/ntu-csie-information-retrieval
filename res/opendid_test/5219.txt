CLINICAL:
Ovarian mass.  Frozen only for bilateral ovaries and left tube.  Endometrial cancer CLL.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries", The  left ovary measures 30 x 25 x 10mm and the right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 12mm.  Both ovaries are macroscopically normal.  The left fallopian tube is 85mm in length and up to 35mm in diameter.  The mid portion is dilated with a smooth inner surface.  The right fallopian tube is 75mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  One frozen section block taken take from each ovary. 
Blocks: 1 - left ovary; 2 - right ovary.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy.
Phone results to Dr Anaesthetic Registrar by Dr L Becena at 1635pm on 21.03.66
Further macroscopic description: specimen consists of a uterus (received previously opened) with attached cervix bilateralfallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 103g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The non peritonealised surface of the uterus are inked black posteriorly and green anteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There isa detached polypoid tan piece of tissue within the endometrial cavity 20 x 13 x 6mm.  This mass has a focally crunchy cut surface, possibly calcified.  Within the endometrial cavity and mostly on the anterior side  there is an ill-defined solid tumour with pale cut surfaces 45 x 40mm in surface dimensions.  The tumour has a maximum depth of 12mm in an area where the myometrium is 17mm thick.  There is a polypoid area in the posterior endometrium 5mm in maximum dimension (block 18).  The right fallopian tube measures 75mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 85mm length.  The left fallopian tube is focally dilated up to 30mm over a length of 35mm.  The cystically dilated area has  smooth inner and outer surface.  The left ovary is 30 x 25 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 - left ovary, FS; 2 - right ovary, FS; 3 and 4 - all of the detached polypoid mass in the endometrial cavity; 5 to 8 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 9 to 12 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 13 and 14 - paired sections longitudinal slice of posterior body of uterus (13inferior, 14 superior); 15 - anterior body of uterus, reserved block; 16 - anterior body of uterus; 17 - posterior body of uterus ?tumour; 18 - posterior body of uterus ?endometrial polyp; 19 - RS rightfallopian tube; 20 to 22 - remainder of the right ovary (the right ovary is AE); 23 - RS left fallopian tube; 24 to 26 - RS the cystically dilated part of the left fallopian tube; 27 to 29 - the remainder of the left ovary (the left ovary is AE) 30 and 31 - remainder of the dilated area in the left fallopian tube
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of omental fatty tissue 80 x 45 x 20mm.  No focal lesions are identified. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - random sections.  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Procaccini):
A.  Sections of uterus show endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, grade 1. The carcinoma infiltrates the lower segment of uterus  but stops short of endocervix. The carcinoma infiltrates the outer half of myometrium to a depth of 11mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 16mm. Definite  lymphovascular invasion is not seen. 
Sections of cervix include the transformation zone and show no significantabnormality. The ovaries have been blocked in toto and show no significant abnormality. Sections of the dilated area in the left fallopian tube show features consistent with hydrosalpinx. Sections of the right fallopian tube show no significant abnormality.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block A7)	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype
Representative slides were shown to Dr L Linberg.

B. Sections show mature adipose tissue with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uteruscervix bilateral tubes and ovaries: 
- Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium,grade 1
- 45mm in maximum dimension (macroscopic)
- The carcinoma infiltrates outer half of myometrium
B. Omental biopsy: No evidence of malignancy
