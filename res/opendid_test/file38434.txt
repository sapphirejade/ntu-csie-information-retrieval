CLINICAL NOTES:
Appendix Ca, fresh frozen, gelatinous nodule, peritoneum, harder small bowel nodule, liver surface mucinous nodule, appendiceal Ca, peritonectomy, gallbladder, right diaphragm strip, omentum, peritoneal disease, falciform ligament.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;GELATINOUS NODULE&amp;quot;.  Consist of a piece of gelatinous tissue 5mm.  Bisected and half embedded for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Acellular mucin&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned to Prof. Newton at 10:50am on 16/10/2070 by Dr. C. Lym.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder tissue).  AE (2-2).

B.  &amp;quot;HARDER NODULE SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Consists of two pieces of tissue 5mm and 3mm.  Half of the larger and smaller piece were embedded for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Fibrous tissue, no evidence of malignancy&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned to Prof. Cristopher at 10:50am on 20/10/2069 by Dr. C. Sampsel.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder tissue).  AE (M-2).

C.  &amp;quot;LIVER SURFACE MUCINOUS NODULE&amp;quot;.  Consists of a piece of tissue 30x1x1mm.  Representative samples embedded for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Favour benign mesothelial  hyperplasia/reactive changes&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned to Prof. Juan at 10:50am on 20/09/2070 by Dr. C. Skarupa.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder tissue).  AE (M-2).

D.  &amp;quot;FALCIFORM LIGAMENT&amp;quot;.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue with glistening surface 95x50mm and underlying tissue to a depth of 20mm.  The serosal surface is focally haemorrhagic.  No firm nodules are identified.  The possible margins are inked blue.

(1&amp;amp;2  representative).  RS (M-2).

E.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIP, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received in one specimen jar, multiple tissue fragments including,

A gallbladder 65x35mm.  The outer surface is smooth with no definite deposits.  The wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surface is green and granular.  No calculi are identified.  One pericystic lymph node 4mm is seen.

(1  cystic duct, TS neck and pericystic lymph node; 2  TS body and LS fundus).

A segment of bowel including a small bowel 115x40mm with attached mesentery up to 30mm with anastomosis lined to a segment of large bowel 80x55mm with attached mesocolon up to 40mm and adherent omental tissue 100x45x30mm.  The outer surface is extensively ragged and haemorrhagic over an area of adhesion, 15x10mm located 20mm of the distal resection margin.  Adherent segment of omentum is identified at this site.  The mucosal surfaces reveal unremarkable mucosa with no polyps or tumours.  Scattered minute foci of  haemorrhage are identified on the serosal surfaces of bowel wall, mesentery and omentum.

(3  proximal and distal resection margins; 4  anastomosis; 5  small bowel; 6  large bowel; 7  omentum).

A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum 270x115x35mm.  Scattered haemorrhagic ragged areas are identified on the outer surface.  No definite nodules are seen.

(8  representative ragged areas).

Received fibrofatty pieces of tissue consistent with peritoneal strips 140x100x40mm in aggregate.  The serosal surface has multiple ragged haemorrhagic areas.

(9&amp;amp;10  representative ragged areas with blocks and tumour block for tissue banking).  RS (M-10/ZH 17/10/2069 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr C Colagiovanni)
A.  Paraffin sections show mucin admixed with inflammatory cells and small fragments of stroma with occasional dystrophic calcification.  No neoplastic epithelium is identified.

B.  Paraffin sections show dense fibrous tissue with a foreign body granuloma to suture material. There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.  Paraffin sections show fibrous connective tissue with benign mesothelial proliferation.  The tissue fragments are admixed with a small amount of mucin and inflammatory cells.  No neoplastic epithelium is identified.

D.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue with no evidence of malignancy.

E.  Sections of gallbladder are within normal limits.  There is no evidence of epithelial dysplasia or malignancy.  One cystic duct lymph node is identified and shows reactive changes.

Sections of large and small bowel mucosa show no significant pathological change.  There are scattered foreign body giant cells in association with suture material.  One omental lymph node with no evidence of malignancy is identified.

Further representative sections show fibroadipose tissue with reactive mesothelium and occasional dystrophic calcification.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  GELATINOUS NODULE -
-ACELLULAR MUCIN.
B.  HARDER NODULE SMALL BOWEL -
-FIBROUS TISSUE, FOREIGN BODY REACTION.
C.  LIVER SURFACE MUCINOUS NODULE -
- ACELLULAR MUCIN.
D.  FALCIFORM LIGAMENT -
-FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.
E.  GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIP, PERITONEAL DISEASE- -FOREIGN BODY REACTION, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
