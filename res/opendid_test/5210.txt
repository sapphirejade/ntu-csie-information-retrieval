HISTORY:  
Frozen section small bowel mesentery.  Ca bowel (CRC).  Chemotherapy, pancreatectomy, omentectomy.  Redo peritonectomy CRC with lover mets.  Small bowel surface frozen section.Live segment 3, mesenteric LN.  Small bowel.  Falciform ligament.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY".  4mm ovoid nodule with attached soft red tissue.  One TS for frozen section.
F/S : "Foreign body response, no tumour seen".  Report to Ferdinand (anaesthetics) by Dr. V. Perretta on 20.7.65.
(1 FS; 2 remainder of tissue).  AE (M-2)
B.  "SMALL BOWEL SURFACE".  Piece of soft tissue measuring 20x12mm containing a firm pale 6mm nodule.  One TS through nodule for frozen section.
F/S : "Adenocarcinoma". Report to Dr. Wesley (anaesthetist) by Dr. V. Dudek at 1035Hrs on 20.07.65.
(1 FS; 2 remainder of the tissue).  AE (M-2)
C.  "LIVER SEGMENT 3".  Liver resection measuring 88x50x48mm. The specimen weighs 66g.  The specimen was sectioned transversely and there is one pale white nodular lesion identified measuring 22x20x about 15mm. The lesion is located subcapsular. The distance from the lesion to the resection margin is 10mm.  Representative sections are taken and embedded.  
(1 resection surgical margin; 2&3 full face section of the specimen of the lesion; 4 another RS of the lesion; 5 RS of the unaffected liver).  RS (M-5)
D.  "TERMINAL SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY".  Piece of fatty tissue measuring 75x45x30mm. The specimen weighs 40g. The surface of the specimen is ragged.  Specimen was sectioned transversely. There is pale white nodular lesion identified measuring 28x about 15x15mm.  Representative sections of the specimen are taken and embedded in four blocks. RS (4-4)
E.  "SMALL BOWEL".  Loop of small bowel with anastomosis with no loop of small bowel. The specimen measures 460mm in length. There are no obviouslesions identified within the lumen of the bowel. The circumference of the bowel is up to 60mm.  The serosal surface of the bowel is very ragged.  However there are no obvious depositions of tumour identified.  Margin is close to side toside anastomosis and located at 10mm from the anastomosis.  Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(1 margin one; 2 margin two; 3 possible mesenteric lymph node; 4-7 RS of the bowel).  RS (M-7)
F.  "MESORECTUM".Piece of loose fatty tissue measuring 50x30x10mm. There are no obvious lesions identified and the specimen was sectioned transversely and all embedded in three blocks.  AE (M-3)
G.  "FALCIFORM LIGAMENT".  Piece of fatty tissue measuring 35x20x12mm.  Specimen was sectioned transversely. There is pale white nodular lesion identified within the specimen measuring 13x10x about 20mm.  Representative sections are taken and embedded in two blocks.  RS (M-2/UX/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (V. Hillsgrove)
A.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with fat necrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of necrosis in keeping with origin from a colorectal primary involving fibrofatty tissue and smooth muscle.  Lymphovascular invasion by the carcinoma is seen.
C.  Sections show liver tissue with metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma including extensive areas of necrosis in keeping with origin from colorectal primary.  The carcinoma is seen to extend into the liver capsule and to involve the diathermied edge of attached fibroadipose tissue.  The liver parenchyma resection margin appears clear of tumour.  The liver parenchyma away from tumour shows mild fatty change and otherwise no intrinsic abnormality.
D.  Sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary involving 5 out of 8 lymph nodes examined.  Extranodal deposits of adenocarcinoma in fibroadipose tissue and involvement of a large artery by carcinoma is also seen.  
E.  Sections through the small bowel show haemorrhagic serosal adhesions associated with an early neutrophilic infiltrate.  One local lymph node examined shows reactive changes.  No tumour is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show adipose tissue with areas of dense fibrosis associated with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate.  Focal foreign body granulomas are also present.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with metastatic deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in keeping withorigin from colorectal primary.  Lymphovascular invasion by the carcinoma is seen.
