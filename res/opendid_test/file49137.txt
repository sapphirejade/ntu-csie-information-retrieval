CLINICAL:
73 y/o female.  Persistent HFIL on cervical screening test.  Previous CIN2 2065.  Cervical stenosis.  Uterus, both ovaries, and tubes.  HIP.

MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of an opened uterus (right to left) with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 66g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 30 x 25mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 30 x 30mm, and appears to have an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness, and the myometrium is  14mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, and 5mm in diameter, with parafimbrial cysts in the right fallopian tube. The right ovary measures 20 x 10 x 10mm, and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, and 5mm in diameter. The left ovary measures 30 x 10 x 10mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  Blocks:  1, 2 and 3 - full longitudinal sections of anterior body and cervix; 4, 5 and 6 - full longitudinal sections of posterior body and cervix; 7 - right fallopian tube; 8 - right ovary; 9 - left fallopian tube; 10 - left ovary; 11 to 15 - anterior lower uterine segment; 16 to 23 - entire posterior lower uterine segment.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Chukri):
The distal portion of the specimen is entirely embedded and examined.  Pending deeper levels sections from here show endocervix and or fibromuscular stroma unassociated with surface epithelium.  No ectocervical squamous lined mucosa is present.  No endocervical glandular dysplasia is seen.

The endometrium is essentially inactive.  The myometrium shows multiple focal adenomyosis.

The  right and left ovaries show senescent changes only.

The right and left fallopian tube are unremarkable

There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus tubes and ovaries:
-  Adenomyosis.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr I Monzo)
Deeper levels show no significant additional features.
