HISTORY:  
Clear cell carcinoma. Uterus, tubes and ovaries. Left pelvic nodes,right pelvic nodes, omental biopsy. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES". A uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, and cervix. The specimen weighs in total 90g. The uterus measures up to 50mm from medial to lateral, 35mm from fundus to cervix, and 40mm from anterior to posterior. There are tubal ligation clips bilaterally on the fallopian tube. The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 6mm in external diameter. The right ovary measures up to 20x10x10mm. The left fallopian tube measures up to 60mm in length and 5mm in external diameter and the left ovary measures 15x10x10mm. There is a white nodule on the surface of the left ovary. There are some benign appearing paratubal cysts bilaterally measuring up to 5mm in maximum extent. The serosal surface of the uterus shows three pale ?tumour deposits on the anterior surface measuring  up to 1mm each. Anterior cervical margin inked blue, posterior cervical margin inked black. The cervix measures 35mm in diameter and is unremarkable. The uterus has been previously openedlaterally. On further opening there is a tumour present in the left fundus approaching the cornu. The right fallopian tube has some suspicious firm areas at the fimbrial end. On sectioning the right ovary has a pale appearance. On sectioning the left ovary has a similar suspicious pale appearance. On sectioning the tumour is ill defined however, appears to have a maximum measurement of 25mm and does not appear to extend more than half the thickness of the myometrium. The uninvolved endometrium measures 1mm and the myometrium measures 20mm in maximum extent. 
(1 right fallopian tube fimbrial end LS and TS tube; 2 representative TS right ovary; 3 representative LS and TS left tube including fimbrial end; 4 representative TS left ovary; 5 right parametrial tissue; 6 left parametrial tissue; 7-9 anterior cervix to fundus; 10 left sided mural fibroid; 11-13 posterior cervix to fundus notches inferior; 14&15 further representative tumour at fundus; 16 further representative fibroid; 17&18 small 1mm firm area on anterior serosal surface of uterus). RS (M-18).
Further tissue:
(19&20 anterior cervix and endocervix; 21&22 right side endocervix [lower uterine segment]; 23&24 posterior cervix and endocervix; 25&26 left lateral lower uterine segment; 27&28 further lateral right sided lower uterine segment). RS (M-28/WB/cy)
B. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". An irregular piece of fatty tissue with possible node measuring 6mm. Transversely sectioned. AE (M-1).
C. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". A piece of tissue, measuring 20x7x4mm. Appears to be a node transversely sectioned. AE (M-1).
D. "OMENTAL BIOPSY". A piece of fatty tissue measuring  up to 15x10x7mm. There are no suspicious areas present on inspection or sectioning. Transversely sectioned. AE (M-1/AK/ht).
Pathologist is to assign tumour reserve block if adequate tumour is present microscopically.
