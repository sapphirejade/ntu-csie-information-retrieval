Sacral sarcoma excised.  Sacral tumour contents.
Specimen was sampled for Cytogenetics.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sacralsarcoma stitch at 12 o'clock" consists of a excision of skin down to skeletal muscle with a suture attached to one side marking 12 o'clock.  The specimen measures 210mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 120mm (3 to 9 o'clock) x 110mm (superficial to deep).  There is an unremarkable ellipse of skin measuring 195mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 42mm (3 to 9 o'clock).  At the deep margin, thespecimen was received open with skeletal muscle retracted and a cavity seen to extend to the tumour, this is presumed surgically related and the true deep margin was taken with the skeletal muscle which had retracted and folded away fromthe cavity.  Also at the deep margin there are three pieces of bony tissue measuring 15, 20 and 30mm in maximum dimension which are at the 12 and 6 o'clock deep aspects surrounding the cavity.  The 3 o'clock margin is inkedblue and the 9 o'clock margin is inked black and the true deep margin is inked red.  The cut surface reveals a friable, haemorrhagic, cream fatty tumour measuring 95mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 80mm (3 to 9 o'clock) x 50mm(superficial to deep).  The lesion appears centred in the subcutaneous fat and extends into the skeletal muscle.  The tumour is 18mm from the 12 o'clock soft tissue margin, 12mm from the 3 o'clock subcutaneous margin, 8mm from the 9 o'clock subcutaneous margin, 12mm from the deep margin and well clear of the deeper 3 and 9 o'clock margins and the 6 o'clock margin.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - 12 o'clock margin; 3 & 4 - superficial 3 o'clock margin; 5 & 6 - superficial 9 o'clock margin; 7 to 9 - deep margin; 10 - more lateral 3 o'clock margin; 11 - more lateral 9 o'clock margin; 12 - 6 omargin; 13 - tumour uninvolved fat; 14 to 17 - further tumour; 18 & 19 - further tumour uninvolved fat; 20 - further tumour. 21 to 27 - bone at thedeep margin. 28 - further decalcified section.
B.  Specimen labelled "Sacral tumour" consists of fragments of cream fatty tissue with attached haemorrhage measuring 150 x 130 x 30mm.  Thecut surface shows homogenous cream fatty tissue.  No areas of dedifferentiation are identified macroscopically.  Representative sections 8 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Sacroiliac joint" consists of four pieces of tan tissue including ?bone tissue.  Each piece bisected.  AE 2 blocks.(TO: NN; JN/rt 9.10.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof A Clevenger and Dr A Ryther):
A&B. Sections show a malignant tumour infiltrating the subcutis and skeletal muscle. Thetumour is comprised of malignant cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei within a background of dense lymphocytic inflammation. There are frequent bizarre nuclear shapes and multinucleated tumour giant cells. There is a focal myxoid background. The mitotic activity is variable across the tumour and is up to 21/10 HPF in some fields.  Approximately 5% of the tumour is necrotic in these sections. The tumour infiltrates the bone towards the deep margin but does not infiltrate cartilage.  
The epidermis shows no evidence of in situ squamous or melanocytic neoplasia.
Immunohistochemistry:
Broad spectrum cytokeratins (pancytokeratins, AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2): A small number of malignant cells are positive, in a patchy distribution.
CK5/6: negative
P63: negative (non-specific staining in background cells, but large pleomorphic tumour cells negative)
EMA: negative (positive around blood vessels).
Vimentin: strongly positive
CD45: negative in malignant cells; highlights the background lymphocytes
Desmin: mainly negative - veryoccasional pleomorphic tumour cells show weak positive staining.
SMA: negative
S100: negative
Melan A: negative
HMB45: negative
Myogenin: negative
Neurofilament:negative
CD99: Weak and patchy non specific staining
CD21: negative
CD31: negative in malignant cells
CD34: negative in malignant cells
CD138: negative in malignant cells
The features are consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation. 
and patchy staining for cytokeratins has been reported in a variety of sarcomas and in this case is interpreted as a non-specific finding. (Ref: Goldblum JR. An approach to pleomorphic sarcomas: Can we subclassify and does it matter? Modern Pathology (2014) 27, S39-S46). 
The negative staining with p63 and keratin 5/6 would support thisinterpretation as many sarcomatoid carcinomas and poorly differentiated squamous carcinomas express these keratins. 
The tumour is FNCLCC grade 3 (tumour differentiation score 3, mitotic count score 2, necrosis score 1). 
Margin clearance:
12 o'clock: 10mm
3 o'clock: 9mm
6 o'clock: well clear
9 o'clock: 5mm
Deep (soft tissue): 10mm
Deep (bone): 1.5mm
C. Sections show fragments of mature bone infiltrated by undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, similar in appearances to specimens A and B.
Dr A Bragdon has seen representative sections of tumour and IHC markers and agrees with this diagnosis and tumour grade.
DIAGNOSIS:
A&B. Sacral tumour: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation, FNCLCC grade 3
C.  Sacroiliac joint: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation, infiltrating bone
