CLINICAL:
SCC vulva. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left labia ulcer stitch at anterior", consists of a triangular shaped skin ellipse measuring 40 x 30 x 9mm. Atone end there is a suture denoting anterior.  Towards the posterior margin is an irregular pale tan lesion, 15 x 25mm which appears to extend to the posterior margin.  The posteriormargin appears to be continuous to the specimen C anterior margin.  The anterior margin is inked blue, posterior margin is inked green and deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned in 13 blocks, serially embedded from left to right.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left anterior vulva skin", consists of an ellipse of skin,26 x 8 x 3mm.  There is no obvious lesion on the skin surface. AE.  Serially embedded in 10 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva stitch on anal margin", consists of a triangular shaped skin excision, 50 x 40 x 10mm.  Centrally there is an irregular greyish white lesion with central ulcerated area, 30 x 20mm. Towards the anterior margin is a firm whitenodule which protrudes from the anterior margin, 13 x 7 x 8mm. At one end there is a suture denoting anal margin.  The anterior margin is inked green which appears to be continuous to the posterior margin of specimen A.  The posterior margin/anal margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially embedded from left margin to rightmargin in 20 blocks (9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14 - composite sections).  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right groin skin lesion", consists of an ellipse of skin, 15 x 11 x 5mm. Centrally there is a skin coloured nodule, 4 x 3mm. The deep surface is inked blue.  Block 1 - 2TS across the lesion; 2 - one end; 3 - other end. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node", consists of fatty tissue, 40 x 50 x 15mm, containing a nodule measuring 30 x 15 x 10mm which is previously and partially cut.  There is an additional lymph node, 10 x 8 x 8mm.  Block 1 - representative sections of the largest node; 2 - smaller nodule bisected.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral inguinal lymph node", consists of fibrofatty tissue, 35 x 15 x 10mm.  Three possible nodes are identified 7 x 3 x 2mm to 18 x 5 x 5mm.  Block  1- largest node trisected; 2 - one node bisected; 3 - smallest node.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral inguinal lymph node", consists of fatty tissue, 40 x 40 x 15mm.  No definitive lymph node can be identified.Block 1 - two ? lymph node; 2-4 - representative sections of the fat.   
H.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal node", consists of fibrofatty tissue, 50 x 35  x 15mm.  Three possible nodes are identified, 8 x 8 x 10mm to 15 x 10 x 10mm.
Block 1 & 2- one node trisected; 3 - one node bisected; 4 - one node trisected; 5 - firm fatty area ? lymph node. 
I.   Specimen labelled "Right lateral groin nodes", consists of fatty tissue, 50 x 35 x 15mm.  Three nodes are identified, 1 x 1 x 1mm to 15 x 10 x 8mm.  Block 1 - largest node bisected; 2- two nodes; 3- ?nodes.  (TO:  Andrea/ec 3.12.65) 
  
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Atwood)
A.  The entire specimen has been examined and there is no evidence of HPV, VIN or malignancy.
B.  The entire specimen has been examined and there is no evidence of HPV, VIN or malignancy.
C.  The entire specimen has been examined.  Sections show multiple foci (possibly up to 10) of well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  The greatest depth of invasion is 1mm and the greatest length is7mm.  Possible focal lymphvascular invasion is noted.  Carcinoma extends to within 8mm of the posterior margin on the left side.  (Carcinoma extends to within 9mm of the anterior margin on the left side but this presumably joins onto specimen A and is therefore not a true margin).  Carcinoma is at least 10mm to all other margins.
VIN 3 is also present and this is clear of all margins.
D.  Sections show a benign intradermal nevus.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One of three (1 of 3) lymph nodes shows almost total replacement by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  Extracapsular spread is present.
F.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  No lymph nodes are present in this specimen.
H.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Multifocal well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the posterior vulva.  Maximum depth 1mm, maximum length 7mm.  Carcinoma and VIN 3 clear of margins (see above).
Oneof thirteen (1 or 13) lymph nodes shows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with extracapsular spread.
