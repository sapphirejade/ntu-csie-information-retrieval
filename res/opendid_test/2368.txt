CLINICAL:
Strong family history of ovarian cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and bilateral ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 65g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 55 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 31mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is an endometrial polyp posteriorly, 16 x 15 x 5mm.  The remainder of the endometrium is 1 to 2mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is up to 16mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube is 58mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 24 x 16 x 9mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 42mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 15 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - sections of endomyometrium including the entire endometrial polyp; 9 & 10 - the entire right ovary; 11 to 13 - the entire right fallopian tube; 14 & 15 - entire left ovary; 16 to 18 - entire left fallopian tube.  (TO: EZ:  OO/mm 14.5.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Hoffmaster):
Both ovaries and tubes have been examined in their entirety, and are unremarkable.
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium contains a benign polyp and is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes:  Small endometrial polyp.  No other significant abnormality detected.
