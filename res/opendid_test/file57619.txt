MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS WITH TUBES AND OVARIES, RECTAL SIGMOID COLON, SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Consists of an en bloc resection of uterus, left and right tubovarian masses, and attached colon. There is a separate small piece of small bowel with a surface nodule.

Uterus:
The uterus measures 55mm superior to inferior, 30mm between cornu and 25mm anterior to posterior. Ectocervix measures 30x20mm with a round small os 2mm diameter.  Anterior wall of uterus measures 10mm, posterior wall measures 12mm.  Endometrium is within 1mm.

The distal parts fallopian tubes on both sides are buried in bilateral tubovarian masses.

Right side  tubovarian mass:
65x40x45mm, solid, pale with papillary tumour exposed to the surface.
Proximal and mid fallopian tube 50mm long is present. The fimbrial end is buried in the tumour mass. Tumour involves the posterior surface and extends onto posterior uterine peritoneal surface.

Left side tubovarian mass:
60x60x65mm.  The mass is pale and solid and invades directly into attached colonic mesocolon and into colon wall and into submucosa and mucosa with a small colonIc mucosal ulcer 20 mm from the proximal colon margin. There is tumour involvement of the tubovarian mass surface, anterior and posterior surfaces. There is a 50 mm long segment of probable fallopian tube over the mass. The distal part of the tube is buried in the mass.

Peritoneum:
There are multiple small tumour deposits present over the anterior peritoneal reflection surface. There are numerous tumour deposits, from 3 mm to 30 mm involving posterior peritoneum down to Pouch of Douglas, and there are numerous separate tumour deposits over the serosal surface of the colon and mesocolon surface.

Colon:
The segment of colon measures 140mm in length 25mm diameter with attaced mesocolon 20 mm long. Proximal colon cut margin inked blue, distal black. Anterior paracervix margin surface inked blue, posterior black. The attachment to tumour is described above. Only on mesocolic lymph node was found. The colon mucosa showed no other lesions.

Seperate piece of small bowel:
A piece of small bowel 50mm in length and 12mm diameter. There is a surface nodule 10mm diameter.

C.  &amp;quot;CAECUM APPENDIX&amp;quot;. An appendix measuring 50mm in length 20mm diameter with staple line at the base 20mm across. The distal appendix is enlarged with a rounded nodule in the wall 15mm diameter. Periteoneal and mesoappendix fatty tissue is attached to the appendix measuring 70x30x15mm, with multiple pale tumour nodules. 3mm from the true margin and inked blue.  (1 two LS from base; 2 two TS from middle; 3&amp;amp;4 one LS from tip each; 5&amp;amp;6 section of deposit).  RS (M-6)

MICROSCOPIC:  Dr G. Rogas

Main specimens:
A. UTERUS WITH TUBES AND OVARIES, RECTAL SIGMOID COLON, SMALL BOWEL:
The tumour is high grade serous carcinoma involving both tubovarian masses. The tumour has typical histology with solid and papillary growth, marked nuclear atypia, numerous mitoses, atypical mitoses, and areas of tumour necrosis. There is direct invasion into attached colon wall through to colon mucosa. There are numerous peritoneal metastases in submitted pelvic tissues (anterior uterine serosa, POD, colon serosal surface, mesocolon).
A mesocolic lymph node metastasis is present; very few other mesocolic nodes were present (1/3 nodes positive).
The separate piece of small bowel has a 10mm serosal metastasis of serous carcinoma.
The ectocervix, cervix and endometrum are normal for age. The endometrium is atrophic.
The colon mucosa away from the site of tumour involvement is normal.
The colon end margins are tumour free.

Other specimens:
B. The omentum contains a 20mm diameter metastasis of serous carcinoma.

C. The appendix contains a 22mm diameter metastasis of serous carcinoma invading within the appendix wall and expanding the tip of appendix. There are separate peritoneal/mesoappendix metastases in peritoneum attached to appendix. A small mesoappendix lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma (1/2 nodes positive, 2mm diameter metastasis).

D. The left paracolic gutter contains a 10mm diameter peritoneal metastasis.

E. The donut shows colon tissue, tumour free.

F. The submitted left pelvic lymph nodes are tumour free (0/3).
