CLINICAL:
Left axillary dissection.  Multifocal breast cancer involved sentinel nodes with extranodal spread.  Level 2 axillary dissection.  Sent as level 1/2.  Further level 2 nodal tissue.    
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Level 1, 2 axillary Rt", consists of an unorientated piece of fatty tissue measuring 140 x 110 x 35mm.  At one end of the specimen there appears to be the remnant of a surgical cavity measuring 80 x 55mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from less than 1-10mm.Block 1-3 - lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 5 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 6- further lymph nodes; 7 - one lymph node bisected. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 2 node Rt axilla", consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue from 8-25mm.  Three lymph nodes are identified from 6-10mm. AE 1 block. 
(TO: NO/ec  13.3.64) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr R Chiras)  
A.  A total of twenty-seven lymph nodeswere identified in the tissue and there is metastatic carcinoma in six of these nodes.  No extranodal spread is seen.  
B.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  All threenodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma.  Tumour is noted in a lymphatic vessel adjacent to one of the nodes but no true extranodal spread is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Level 1, 2 right axilla:  Metastatic carcinoma in six nodes (6/27). 
B.  Level 2 right axilla:  Metastatic carcinoma in three nodes (3/3).
