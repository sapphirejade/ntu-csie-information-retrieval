CLINICAL:
Right posterior thigh tumour.  Surgical resection post neoadjuvant radiation therapy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Posterior tumour ?tumour",consists of a piece of tan tissue 12 x 10 x 3mm.  AE as TS in 1 block for FS.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No tumour
Phone result to Prof P Worthington by Dr P Birmingham at 11:08am on 09.11.65
B.  Specimen labelled "Right posterior thigh tumour short - superior, medium - medial", consists of an excision of a solid tumour with surrounding soft tissue and overlying skin, weighing 5120g in total.  The tumour is 330mm (superior to inferior) x 170mm (superficial to deep) x 150mm (medial to lateral).  The tumour is centred within skeletal muscle, with skeletal muscle more prominently visible over the lateral aspect of the tumour.  At the inferior end of the tumour there is uninvolved skeletal muscle, 80 x 50 x 40mm.  There is overlying skin with subcutaneous fat, 410 x 95mm.  In the centre of the skin ellipse is an area of scarring, 40 x 15mm.  The mass appears to have been excised intact with smooth intact overlying fascia and muscle.  The medial margin is inkedblue, lateral green, and deep black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 21 slices.  The tumour appears thinly encapsulated, and abuts the medial and deep margins and is 3mm clear of the lateral margin.  The mass is predominately haemorrhagic and necrotic (approximately 80%).  The viable tumour has a pale grey fleshy appearance and is mainly located along the lateral edge of the tumour, in slices eight to ten. There is a possible tract from the tumour through the subcutis to the epidermal scar in slices ten and eleven.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - slice one superior margin; 5 and 6 - slice two; 7 to 11 - slice three; 12 to 15 - slice four; 16 and17 - slice five; 18 and 19 - slice six; 20 and 21 - slice seven; 22 to 25 - slice eight; 26 - slice nine; 27 to 30 - slice ten; 31 to 34 - slice eleven; 35 - slice twelve; 36 thirteen; 37 and 38 - slice fourteen; 39 and 40 - slice fifteen; 41 to 44 - slice sixteen; 45 and 46 - slice seventeen; 47 to 49 - slice eighteen inferior margin of tumour; 50 - uninvolvedinferior skeletal muscle. 
Specimen photographs taken.  Please see block diagram.  Tumour sampled fresh for cytogenetics.  (ET/vo 9.12.65)  
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Bellefleur):
A.  Paraffin sections confirm no evidence of malignancy.  
B.  Sections show a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma consisting of highly atypical cells with focally eccentrically placed, dense eosinophilic cytoplasm and highly pleomorphic nuclei, many ofwhich are bizarrely shaped and multinucleated.  The chromatin is hyperchromatic and vesicular, and occasional prominent eosinophilic nuclei are seen.  Focal myxoid areas are seen within the tumour and there is extensive necrosis, occupying approximately 70% of the tumour mass.  The severe nuclear atypia and necrosis may be therapy related.  The tumour is situated adjacent to skeletal muscle and fibroadipose which show no atypia.  The tumour cells show patchy positive staining with desmin.  The SMA, myogenin, PanCK, S100 and CD31 stains are negative.  There is moderate background staining with CD34.  The tumour appears completely excised with the medial margin 0.2mm clear, the lateral margin 3mm clear, the superior margin 1.5mm clear,the inferior margin 2mm clear and the deep margin 1mm clear.   The tumour is well clear of the superficial (skin margin). 
COMMENT:
The features are those of high grade pleomorphic sarcoma.  The patchy desmin staining raises the possibility of leiomyosarcoma however, there are no other definite features of leiomyosarcoma.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Posterior ?tumour:  No evidence of malignancy. 
B.  Right thigh:  High grade pleomorphic sarcoma, margins appears clear (see comment).
