CLINICAL:
Hx of Dukes C carcinoma of the colon in 2062.  New pelvic mass Ca 125 90.  CEA 6.7.  Ovarian or colorectal???
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a mass with a disrupted surface measuring 170 x 120 x 16mm with an attached tube measuring 60mm in length.  The tumour has large areas of necrosis with some smaller tan areas identified.  Two representative sections taken for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 - representative tube; 4 to 11 - further representative tumour.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma, appearances more in keeping with colorectal metastasis.  Awating immunohistochemistry.  
Phone results to Dr Bert Bristle by DrAndre Zekria & Dr G Stemm at 1:56pm on 30.09.2064.
.  Specimen labelled "Right ovarian ligament", consists of a piece of irregular tan and haemorrhagic tissue measuring 40 x 25 x 15mm.  No definite tumour is identified.  Representative sections in 2 blocks.  (approximately 80% of tissue embedded)
C.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary and tubal remnant", consists of a piece of tan haemorrhagic tissue 17 x 10 x 5mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Left adnexa", consists of a piece of irregular tan fatty tissue 70 x 30 x 15mm.  A ?disrupted tube measuring 35mm in maximum dimension is identified.  No definite ovary is seen. 
Blocks: 1 -  ?tube; 2 and 3 - further representative tissue ?ovarian.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 120 x 45 x 15mm.  No definite suspicious areas are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled "Umbilical hernia sac", consists of two pieces of tan fatty tissue 30 and 45mm in maximum dimension.  One piece has a firm pale fibrous tissue.  The other piece appears predominately fatty.  
Blocks: 1 - representative fibrous piece; 2 - fatty piece.  AE.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Jergen & Dr P Waite):
A.  Sections show adenocarcinoma which consists of glands and cribriform structures comprised of stratified columnar epithelium with luminal necrosis and further large areas of necrosis within the tumour.  The tumour cells stain positive for CK20 and CDX2 and negative for CK7.   The morphological and immunohistochemical appearances are consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from a colorectal primary.
The fallopian tube is unremarkable. 
B.  Sections show adipose, fibrous and ovarian tissue which are infiltrated by adenocarcinoma of similar appearance to that seen in specimen A. 
C.  Sections show fallopian tube tissue with no significant abnormality. No ovarian tissue is identified. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
D.  Sections show fallopian tube tissue and a small adjacent serous cystadenofibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
E.  Sections show unremarkable fatty tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
F.  Sections show unremarkable fibrous and fatty tissue.  There is noevidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right ovary and tube:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.
B.  Right ovarian ligament:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.
C   Left ovary and tubal remnant:  Unremarkable tubal tissue. 
D.  Left adnexa:  Unremarkable tubal tissue and small serous cystadenofibroma. 
E.  Omentum:  No significant abnormality.
F.  Umbilical hernia sac:  No significant abnormality.
