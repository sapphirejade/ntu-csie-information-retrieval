HISTORY:  
Right pelvic mass.  PH granulosa cell tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"RIGHT PELVIC MASS".  Unorientated firm piece of tissue measuring 35x27x17mm.  It is of a total weight of 5g.  The outer surface has a smooth glistening surface with attached adipose tissue and an extensively haemorrhagic ragged cut surface.  The smooth surface is inked blue, the ragged is inked black. The cut surface is variegated yellow, tan and pink with areas of possible blood clots and areas of possible fat.  The lesion appears to be well demarcated.
(1 LS of each radial margin; 2-4 TSof center).  RS (5-4/BE/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr RGerardo)
Sections of fibro-adipose tissue show a lesion consistent with recurrent adult granulosa cell tumour. The tumour is comprised of nodules and sheets of cells. The cells contain minimal to moderate pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval cleaved nuclei. Nuclear grooves are identified and some cells contain a small nucleolus. Call-Exner bodies are noted. There are up to 8 mitoses per 10HPF (field diameter 0.55mm). The tumour nodules are accompanied by areas of geographic necrosis. There are also interspersed areas with haemorrhage, hemosiderin laden macrophages and a myofibroblast proliferation. The tumour cells are 0.2mm from the closest resection margin (slide 4).
Immunostains show positive staining of the tumour cells with inhibin, calretinin, melanA and weak patchy positivity with ER. The tumour cells show negative staining with CAM5.2, EMA, HMB45 and SMA. This immunoprofile is consistent with an adult granulosa cell tumour. 
Slides from the previous specimen in 2055 (66H08509) were viewed and show similar features to the present case. 
DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT PELVIC MASS -
- CONSISTENT WITH RECURRENT ADULT GRANULOSA CELL TUMOUR.
- EXCISION APPEARS COMPLETE WITH CLOSE MARGIN (See Report).
