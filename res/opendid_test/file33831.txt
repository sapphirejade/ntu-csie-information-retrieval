MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 136g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 62 x 34mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 22 x 22 mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Note:  The cervix appears blue (?intraoperative dye).  The endometrium where not involved by tumour is up to 1mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is 10mm in maximum thickness.  There is a tumour centred in the endometrial cavity, 54mm (medial to lateral) x 55mm (superior to inferior) and 28mm (anterior to posterior).  A separate pale nodule is present in the cervical region, 8 x 8 x 4mm posteriorly (?tumour nodule, ?fibroid).  It appears to be discontinuous of the main tumour mass, 24mm away from it.  The right fallopian tube measures 64mm in length and 5 to 25mm in diameter.  It is adherent to the posterior uterine serosal surface. In addition there is a  parafimbrial cyst, 14 x 8 x 8mm.  The right ovary measures 25 x 12 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 54 x 5 x 20mm.  There is a parafimbrial cyst present, 8 x 4 x 4mm.  The left ovary measures 20 x 12 x 7mm, andthere are surface nodules, 2 to 6mm in five which are pale on cut section.  Blocks: 1 to 5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6 - parasagittal sections of left of mid line anteriorly showing ?deeper invasion; 7 - parasagittal sections left mid line showing ?deeper invasion; 8 - left cornua showing ?deeper invasion; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - composite sections to the right of midline, anteriorly showing ?deeper invasion; 11 to 15 - full LS posterior body and cervix (14 &amp;amp; 15 - one bisected slice showing nodule in cervix); 16 &amp;amp; 17 - one parasagittal section to the left of midline posteriorly showing ?deeper invasion; 18 &amp;amp; 19 - one composite parasagittal section to the right of mid line showing ?deeper invasion; 20 - right parasagittal section + serially ?deeper invasion; 21 &amp;amp; 22 - composite sections to the right of midline posteriorly lesion ?deeper invasion (NB: 18 to 22 - show area where right tube was adherent to the posterior serosa); 23 - remaining right ovary; 24 - fimbrial end of right fallopian tube, longitudinally bisected; 25 - TS right fallopian tube; 26 - left ovary serially sectioned showing nodule; 27 - LS bisected fimbrial end of the left tube; 28 - representative TS the left fallopian tube. Photographs taken.   (TO: LK/ta 22/12/69)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Grissom):
Sections show endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2, of the endometrium. The lesion has a complex glandular architecture, is composed of back-to-back glands lined by stratified columnar tumour cells with moderate nuclear atypia. Just over 5% of the lesion has a solid architecture (e.g. 11,12), consistent with a grade 2 lesion.

The maximum depth of invasion is 11mm into myometrium 13mm thick (7).

No lymphovascular invasion is seen.

The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect, CIN or malignancy.

Benign leiomyomas and adenomyosis are present in the myometrium.

The ovaries and fallopian tubes show no evidence of malignancy. Polarisable suture material surrounded by granulation tissue is present adjacent to the right ovary.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.


DIAGNOSIS
Uterus and cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes:
- Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2
- Maximum depth of invasion 11mm into myometrium 13mm thick
