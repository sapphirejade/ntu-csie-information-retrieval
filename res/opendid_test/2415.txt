CLINICAL:
Recurrent vulval Ca.  Left anterior vulva stitch at 12 o'clock.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left anterior vulval stitch at 12 o'clock" consists of an orientated irregular shaped skin excision measuring 50 x 25 x 15mm.  On the skin surface there is a ragged and brown colour lesion measuring 20 x 15mm.  The 12 o'clock margin is clear by 5mm and the 9 o'clock pole is clear by 5mm macroscopically.  There is a defectat one edge of the tumour measuring 7mm in maximum dimension.  The 6 o'clock half is inked blue and the 12 o'clock half is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from 3 to 9 o'clock into 12 slices.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  The entire specimen embedded in 12 blocks.  Please refer to the diagram.  AE.  (TO: Stallworth  Wun/mm 13.1.64) 

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Crichlow) 
Sections show a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The carcinoma is arising from an ulcerated surface and invades deeply into the soft tissues, in small clusters and cords, surrounded by an inflamed desmoplastic stroma. The maximum depth of invasion is 3mm. The carcinoma measures 13mm in diameter and approximately 16mm in length. Focally, the carcinoma reaches the fragmented deep plane of excision (block 9). Perineural invasion or lymphovascular invasion is not seen. The carcinoma lies 2.5mm from the closest peripheral margin, which is 12 o'clock, 3mm from the closest 6 o'clock margin and lies more than 10mm from each of the 3 and 9 o'clock margins. Foci of evolving differentiated VIN are seen, away from the margins. There is extensive lichen sclerosus in the background.  
Representative slides have been shown to Dr. W Rowels.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left anterior vulval stitch at 12 o'clock: 
	Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
	Focally reaching the deep margin; clear of peripheral margins
	Lichen sclerosus
