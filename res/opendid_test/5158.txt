HISTORY:  
Hx of colon cancer.  Peritonectomy.  Redo right hemicolectomy.  Peritoneal disease, ileocolic anastomosis, wound, para-aortic lymph node.  Colorectal ca, Ix previous resection.  Multiple mets.  
Frozen sections : 
1. Spleen.
2. Duodenum.
3. Small bowelmesenteric nodule.
4. Small bowel mesenteric plaque.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "SPLEEN".  Brown tissue 7x7x4mm, bisected.  
F/S : "Old haemorrhage.  No tumour".   Reported to Registrar at 9.37 am by Dr. J. Mellom on 29.1.66.  AE (2-1)
B.  "DUODENUM". A firm fibrous nodule 5mm, bisected, and a separate 3mm soft piece.  
F/S : "Fibrosis.  No tumour".  Reported to registrar by Dr. J. Kahoohalphala on 29.1.66. AE (2-1)
C.  "SMALL BOWEL MESENTERIC NODULE". A 3mm piece of soft tissue.  
/S : "Fibrosis.  No tumour".  Reported by Dr. J. Schlachter on 29.1.66.
D.  "SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY PLAQUE".  Soft tissue 9x9x2mm cut into four TS.
F/S : "Fibrosis.  No tumour". Results to Ben, Registrar at 9.37am by Dr. J. Mota on 29.1.66.
E.  "ILEAL SIGMOID ANASTOMOSIS + PERITONEAL DISEASE".  
Ileosigmoid anastomosis - An anastomosed segment of small and large bowel.  One segment measuring up to 170mm in length and theanastomosed segment measuring 90mm in length. The external surface shows some adhesions but no definite tumour deposits are seen macroscopically.  There is mesentery attached on both segments.  On opening the small and large bowel segments have a well healed blind end and a resection margin on each.  The anastomosis is healed and mucosa is unremarkable macroscopically.  
(1-3 small bowel [1 LS resection margin, 2 representative mucosa with firmer serosal surface; 3 representative possible adhesions]; 4-8 representative large bowel segment [4 LS resection margin, 5&6 representative mucosal. 7 firmer serosal surface areas, 8 ? firm mesenteric serosal surface]; 9 fibrous peritoneal surface of mesentery; 10 six possible nodes small bowel mesentery; 11 four possible nodes large bowel mesentery)
Peritoneal Disease - Multiple pieces of fatty tissue with some peritoneal surfaces present, measuring in aggregate 80x80x50mm.  One piece appears to be a gelatinous mass measuring 45mm in maximal extent.  On sectioning there are some necrotic ? lymph nodes in the fatty tissue and the surface has some irregular adhesions, however no definite tumour deposits identified macroscopically.
(12-14 mucinous mass all embedded; 15 ? necrotic LN; 16 firm fibrous areas on surface; 17 further necrotic ? node).  RS (M-17/ED/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr J Calvano)
A.  Sections show degenerate debris containing cholesterol clefts surrounded by a fibrous tissue suggestive of organising haematoma. No evidence of malignancy. 
B.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue in which there is fibrous scarring and patchy chronic inflammation. No evidence of malignancy. 
C.  Sections  show fibroadipose tissuein which there is fibrous scarring and patchy chronic inflammation. No evidence of malignancy. 
D.  Sections  show fragments of fibrous tissue. No evidence of malignancy. 
E.  Sections from the small bowel show serosal fibrosis. Focally, there is foreign body giant cell reaction. A focus of extravasated mucin is identified. 
Sections  of the large bowel also show serosal fibrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction. There is an area ofsubmucosal fibrosis and thinning of the muscularis propria. The mucosal surface appears unremarkable. 
Sections  of the peritoneum show abundant extravasated mucin with overlying reactive mesothelial proliferation.  Most of the mucin appears necrotic and contains strips of degenerate cells.  
Immunohistochemistry stains show positive staining of the degenerate cells within theextravasated mucin for cytokeratin CAM5.2 and CEA, highly suspicious for necrotic mucinous adenocarcinoma.  No viable tumour cells are identified.
No evidence of malignancy is seen in six lymph nodes identified. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  SPLEEN - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
B,C,D.  DUODENUM, SMALL BOWEL MESENTERIC NODULE AND MESENTERY PLAQUE -
 - FIBROUS SCARRING. 
E.  ILEOSIGMOID ANASTOMOSIS AND PERITONEAL DISEASE - 
 - FIBROUS SCARRING WITH INFARCTED EXTRAVASATED MUCIN. FOCAL CHANGES HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS FOR NECROTIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.
