CLINICAL NOTES:
Right breast cancer, bilateral mastectomy, right sentinel node biopsy.  R axillary sentinel node for frozen section.

MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard:  Anterior superior blue, Anterior inferior green, Posterior black.

FINDINGS / LESION:  The nipple is focally ulcerated.  Within the nipple itself is a tumour with a pale white appearance, measuring 13 medial to lateral x 8 superior to inferior x 9mm anterior to posterior.  The lesion is well away from the margins (17mm from posterior margin), 65 from superior, 40 from inferior, less than 1mm from anterior/skin ?involved.  Remainder of the breast tissue is otherwise fibrofatty in appearance.  Representative sections taken.

OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  Piece of separate fibrofatty tissue measuring 50x35x8mm (weight measurement include this small piece).
MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard:  Anterior superior blue, Anterior inferior green, Posterior black.
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral
Number of slices:  15
FINDINGS / LESION:  The cut surface is fibrofatty in appearance.  No discrete lesion is identified.  The separate piece of tissue, resection margin is inked blue.  On sectioning, the cut surface is fibrofatty.  No discrete lesion is identified.  Separate piece not sampled.  Representative sections taken.
