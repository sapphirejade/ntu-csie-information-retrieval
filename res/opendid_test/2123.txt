Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Sigmoidectomy.  Palliative.  Known extensive liver and nodal mets.  Obstructing tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon" and consists of a segment of colon (received opened) 110mm in length and 60mm in circumference, with mesocolic fat 35mm in width.  There is a circumferential stenosing tumour, 50 x 45 x 12mm.  The tumour is 25mm clear of the closest margin and 35mm clear of the opposite margin.  The tumour infiltrates through the muscularis propria and abuts the overlying serosa which appears puckered.  The tumour infiltrates into the mesocolic fat.  This area is located immediately next to an ill-defined indurated mesocolic mass, 30 x 15 x 30mm.  A lymph node is identifiedin direct continuity with this mass.  There are also multiple small lymph nodes in the vicinity of this matted mass.
Blocks: 1 - margin closest to tumour; 2 - opposite margin; 3 - tumour with uninvolved bowel; 4 & 5 - tumour extending to serosa (4 - reserve block); 6 to 9 - paired sections tumour and pericolic fat with indurated mass; 10 - apical tissue; 11 lymph node; 12 & 13 - multiple lymph nodes; 14 - one lymph node immediately adjacent to mass in mesocolon; 15 to 18 - multiple lymph nodes adjacent to mesocolic mass.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with micro satellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of micro satellite instability phenotype.
