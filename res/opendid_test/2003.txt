CLINICAL:
Metastatic CRC.  Seg VII lesion, seg V/VIII lesion ? x3.  21/1/64 - R hemicolectomy and low anterior resection with ileostomy for adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Segment VII", consists of a wedge of liver measuring 70 x 50 x 42mm.  The cut surface reveals a heterogeneous, haemorrhagic cream and necrotic tumour measuring 28 x 22 x 20mm.  The lesionappears to abut the capsule surface but not definitely penetrate through it. There is fibrinous material on the capsular surface surrounding the tumour.  This area is inked blue while the surgical resection margin is inked black. The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.  
Blocks 1-3 - tumour to capsule; 4 - tumour to surgical resection margin; 5 - uninvolved liver; 6 - reserve block.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Segment V and VIII", consists of a wedge of liver 65 x 30 x 18mm.  The capsular surface appears unremarkable. The cut surface does not reveal any definite tumour deposits.  AE in 14 blocks. (TO: KL/ec  10.11.64)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr A Lebaron)
A.Sections of liver show a 28mm deposit of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma focally abuts the capsular surfaceand shows extracapsular extension into overlying adherent fibroadipose tissue, where it is 0.8mm from the diathermied surface. The carcinoma is 8.0mm from the resection margin. The carcinoma is CK20 positive and CK7 negative. The adjacent liver shows patchy mild inflammation and macrovesicular steatosis. 
B.  The specimen has been examined in its entirety. Sections show a 3.3mm subcapsular deposit of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is 0.3mm from the capsular surface and is 6.6mm from the surgical margin. The carcinoma is CK20 positive and CK7 negative. The adjacent liver shows patchy macrovesicular steatosis. 
COMMENT:
The sections of liver a 28mm and a 3.3mm deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, respectively. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining would be consistent with primary colorectal origin. 
Please correlate with clinical and imaging findings. 

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Liver segment VII: 28mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma

B.  Liver segment, V and VIII: 3.3mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
