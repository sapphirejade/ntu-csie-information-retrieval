CLINICAL:
R elbow mass, likely SCC. Excision right elbow SCC.  Medial cutaneous nerve right arm. 

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right elbow mass likely SCC", consists of a piece of tissue 7 x 6 x 4mm.  BAE 1 block for FS. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Carcinoma, consistent with SCC. 
Result to Dr A Ghazal by Dr A Correl at 16:00 on 12.05.66. 
B.  Specimen labelled "R elbow mass 12 o'clock stitch, double stitch deep lateral margin", consists of a circular excision of skin 115 x 115mm to a maximum depth of 85mm.  There is a long suture marking 12 o'clock and a double stitch marking deep lateral.  The peripheral margin is inked blue and 3 o'clock black and 9 o'clock. The deep margin is inked green.  Centrally, underlying the epidermis,  there is an tumour 75 x 70 X 65mm, well clear of peripheral margins. The tumour has pale red and necrotic cut surfaces.  The tumour is expanding the subcutis and is causing the epidermis to bulge outwards. The tumour comes very close to the deep margin in multiple foci.  There is skeletal muscle at the deep aspect of the specimen.  The specimen is serially sliced from 12 towards 6 o'clock. 
Blocks 1 & 2 - paired sections, LS 12 o'clock, slice 1; 3 - deep margin, slice 2; 4 - 
9 o'clock side of deep margin, slice 3; 5 - centre deep, slice 3; 6-8 - comprise one slice through centre of slice 5; 9 - lateral deep margin, slice 6 (area marked by suture); 10 - 3 o'clock margin, slice 7; 11 - 9 o'clock margin, slice 7; 12 - section of skin with no margins, slice 7; 13 - section of skin with no margins, slice 8; 14 - deep slice 9 (there is a smaller suture here); 15 - deep slice 9; 16 - skin, slice 11, no margins; 17 - centre deep, slice 11; 18 & 19 - paired sections LS 6 o'clock.  Please see the diagram;
20 & 21 - representative slice one (12 o'clock); 22 to 31 - all of slice four; 32 to 36 - 9 o'clock third of slice five; 37 to 39 - 3 o'clock third of slice five; 40 & 41 - representative slice twelve ( 6 o'clock);  42 & 43 - deep aspect of slice seven; 44 to 47 - deep aspect of slice eight; 48 to 52 - deep aspect of slice ten.  Please see the updated diagram.   (TO: EM; TL/ta 17/5/66) 
C.  Specimen labelled"New deep lateral margin", consists of an unoriented bony piece of tissue 20 x 15 x 7mm.  Specimen will be decalcified and sectioned later.  (TO: KY/ec   13.5.66) The specimen is sliced.  Blocks:  1 & 2 - AE. 
(TO: SB; OG/rt 16.5.66)
D.  Specimen labelled "Level I axillary clearance", consists of an unoriented piece of fatty tissue 125 x 105 x 38mm. The specimen is sliced and examined for lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is 30 x 20 x 15mm and is involved by metastatic tumour (block 1).  Block 1- representative sections the largest lymph node; 2 & 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one lymph node; 5 - one lymphnode; 6 - lymph nodes as seen; 7 - lymph nodes as seen; 8 - lymph nodes as seen; 9 - one lymph node.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Level II axillary clearance", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 45 x 42 x 10mm.  A few lymph nodes are identified, the largest is 14mm in maximum dimension.  Block 1- one lymph node; 2 - lymph nodes as seen. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Medial percutaneous nerve right arm", consistsof a segment of a nerve 45 x 2 x 2mm with attached soft tissue 10 x 5 x 3mm.  The external surface is inked green.   Sliced  AE in 3 blocks.  (TO: EH/ec   13.5.66) 
 

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof A Montanye and Dr A A Castagna):
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
B. The specimen was re-examined and further blocks taken after examination of the initial sections. 
Sections  of the skin from theepidermis to muscle layer show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma  invading through skeletal muscle with multifocal  involvement of the deep margin.  The carcinoma infiltrates beneath the epidermis in most areas, and thereis epidermal ulceration but a focal points of epidermal origin are identified (blocks 29, 38).
The carcinoma measures approximately 55m in depth with extensive necrosis. Perineural, intraneural and lympho-vascular invasion are present. Invasion of large vessels is present.
The peripheral skin margins are clear of the tumour.
C.  Sections of bone show  squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the bone and marrow space. The carcinoma does not appears to extend through the full thickness of the specimen, however, the orientation of the new deep margin is not certain.
D. Sections  show  metastatic carcinoma in  3 out of 15 lymph nodes.
E. Sections of five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/5).
F. Sections show unremarkable nerves. No evidence of malignancy is seen. 
DIAGNOSIS
A. Right elbow mass 
- Squamous cell carcinoma 
B. R elbow mass 12 0'clock stitch
- Squamous cell carcinoma with involvement of deep margin
C. New deep margin
- Squamous cell carcinoma within bone
D. Level 1 axillary clearance 
	- Metastases to 3/15 lymph nodes 
E. Level II axillary clearance 
No evidence of malignancy in 5 nodes.
F. Medial percutaneous nerve right arm.
	- No evidence of malignancy.
