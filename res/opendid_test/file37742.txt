CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritoneal nodule appendix tumour.
Peritoneal nodule. Frozen section.
Reversal of stoma. Peritonectomy 2068.
- Peritoneal nodule.
- Small bowel segments from reversal of ileostomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;. Received fresh, 2 x yellow nodules: 5x5x4mm and 9x6x5mm, with a fatty cut surface. TS of each for frozen section.

F/S: &amp;quot;Negative for malignancy&amp;quot; per phone to Dr. Manuel (liver registrar) at 10:40am on 07/10/70 by Dr. Z. Nale.

(1 frozen section tissue; 2 rest of specimen). AE (M-2)

B. &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULES&amp;quot;. Six pieces of fatty tissue, 12-40mm in size. The fatty tissue contains multiple regions of partially calcified fat necrosis ranging from 6-15mm in size. A piece of fibrous tissue with ?skeletal muscle is also present. No lesions seen within that piece of tissue.

(1-3 fat necrosis; 4 fibrous area; 5 tumour banking, region of fat necrosis). RS (M-5)

C. &amp;quot;STOMA&amp;quot;. An ileostomy specimen, 80mm in length and up to 20mm in diameter, with a stomal opening at one end, 13x12x5mm. The mucosa at the stoma opening is unremarkable. Fatty tissue with fibrosis is seen adherent to the small bowel. Also present separately is a piece of tan tissue, 40x15x10mm. On sectioning, there is possible fibrosis around the stomal site. No obvious lesions within the mucosa.

(1-4 stoma, all embedded; 5 one TS of small bowel and sample from the piece of soft tissue; 6 longitudinal section of stapled margin). RS (M-6/JC 7/9/2067 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. Z Trickey)
A.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue in which there are changes of fat necrosis and diffuse infiltrate of xanthomatous histocytes.  Occasional multinucleated histiocytes are identified.  No evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show fragments of fibroadipose tissue in which there are changes of fat necrosis with diffuse infiltrate of xanthomatous histiocytes.  Occasional multinucleated foreign body giant cell granulomas are noted.  A blood vessel shows dystrophic calcification.  There are also fragments of skeletal muscle present.  No evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show small intestine incontinuity with skin consistent with ileostomy site. The skin shows stromal fibrosis. Within the fat, there are changes of fat necrosis.  No evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  PERITONEAL NODULE -
-FAT NECROSIS AND XANTHOGRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION.
B.  PERITONEAL NODULES -
-FAT NECROSIS AND XANTHOGRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION.
C.  STOMA -
-FIBROUS SCARRING AND FAT NECROSIS.
