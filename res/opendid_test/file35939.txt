CLINICAL NOTES:
Small bowel tumour mass, SBO, recurrence of disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Received multiple tissue fragments including a segment of large bowel measuring 100x30mm with extensive adhesions on the outer surface.  Two firm nodular areas 10x10mm and 7x5mm with hard white cut surface.  The mucosal surface is unremarkable.

(1&amp;amp;2  representative nodules).

A fragmented piece of large bowel 130mm in length and up to 45mm in circumference with anastomosis lined at central specimen and haemorrhagic roughened surface towards one margin.  There is a central mass near the anastomosis site measuring 30x30x25mm.  The cut surface reveals hard white tumour invading the wall and approaching the mucosal surface with underlying nearby entrapped bowel lumen with fecal material in situ.

(3 roughened edge at edge of specimen; 4-6  tumour with entrapped lumen  at site of anastomosis).

A segment of small bowel with central anastomosis site measuring 140x60mm, comprises multiple dilated loops of bowel with extensive adhesions.  No intraluminal tumours are identified.  The serosal surface is ragged and haemorrhagic focally haemorrhagic.

(7  ragged areas; 8  anastomosis).

A segment of small bowel with extensive overlying adhesion 90x35mm.

( 9 ragged surface; 10 adhesions with adherent bowel loops).

Two segments of bowel 60x35mm and 20x35mm.  The mucosal surfaces are dusky in the larger fragment over a length of 30mm, involving one margin macroscopically.

(11  dusky area involving one margin and LS other margin macroscopically; 12  transition zone [no margins]).

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue 70x40x25mm, with a segment of mucosa at one end measuring 35x20 mm. the fatty tissue is totally replaced by multinodular firm white tumour deposit.

(13&amp;amp;14  representative largest tumour deposit with block 14 tumour block for tissue banking).  RS (M-14).

B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;.  A fibrofatty piece tissue 12x6x4mm with hard white cut surface trisected.  AE (3-1/ZH 10/6/2067 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr G Rarogal)
A.  Histology shows widespread infiltration of the colon and small bowel by moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma has variable morphology with some areas showing more typical adenocarcinoma, NOS, with more predominant areas showing abundant extracellular mucin containing well-formed glandular structures with mild to moderate atypical nuclei (suggestive of prior goblet cell carcinoid with synaptophysin expression, Ki67 50-80%).  All areas of the tumour are widely infiltrative with transmural infiltration of the colon reaching focally the mucosa and infiltration through muscularis propria into the submucosa of the small bowel.  Other areas of dense fibrous adhesions with tumour deposits within omental fat are also seen.

B.  Histology shows a small nodular deposit of metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.
