HISTORY:  
Peritonectomy.  Peritoneal disease.  PMP cystic material.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEALDISEASE PMP CYSTIC MATERIAL".  Multiple small pieces of fibrous tissue measuring in aggregate 110x120x20mm with free mucus 45x30x30mm. Part of a tubular structure is seen measuring 20x5mm.  RS (M-8/PF/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr F. Aramboles)
Histology shows multiple pieces of fibrous connective tissue and fat with several pieces of vas deferens present. In areas, some of the fibrotic tissue present contains surface strips of low-gradeatypical mucinous epithelium with abundant free surface mucin. There is some dissection of mucin throughout the fibrous connective tissue and surrounding vas deferens where there is patchy chronic inflammation. Very focally in one small area, there is a focus of peri-neural invasion by a single low-grade gland. No high-grade changes are seen. Morphology is similar to the previous resection of specimen which has been reviewed for comparison (27H47999) and are consistent with low-grade mucinous neoplasm. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL DISEASE PMP CYSTIC MATERIAL
- DEPOSITS OF LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
