CLINICAL:
L testis.  Clinically Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left testis", consists of a specimen of testis (60 x 45 x 35mm) with attached spermatic cord (105mm in length and up to 18mm in diameter).  The external surface is inked blue.  Withinthe testis there is a 38 x 30 x 28mm solid tumour with pale pink and haemorrhagic cut surfaces. The tumour appears to be encapsulated. The tunica vaginalis is easily separated from the testis during dissection.   Block 1 - spermatic cord resection margin shave; 2 - TS mid spermatic cord; 3 & 4 - paired sections tumour and ? rete testis; 5- 2TSdistal spermatic cord; 6 - tumour and ? rete testis; 7 - tumour; 8 - tumour, reserve block; 9-11 - sections of tumour.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr F Veldkamp) 

TESTIS TUMOUR PROFORMA
Histologic type:  
	Mixed germ cell tumour with types as follows (%) 	
		Teratoma: 70%
Embryonal carcinoma:20%
Yolk sac: 10%
Scarring: Absent
Syncytiotrophoblasticgiant cells: Present
Maximum tumour size (maximum dimension): 38mm
Extent of tumour
Rete testis invasion: Absent
Epididymis invasion: Absent 
Tunica albuginea invasion: Absent 
Tunica vaginalis invasion: Absent
Spermatic cord invasion: Absent
Scrotal wall invasion: Absent
Lymphovascular invasion: Absent
Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN): Absent 
	Type: Not otherwise specified 
	Extent: Focal
Other comment: The teratoma is composed of squamous epithelium, glandular tissue, cartilage and blastema with neuroepithelium. The embryonal carcinoma shows positive staining for CD30 and PLAP. The focal yolk sac component shows weak staining for alpha-fetoprotein. Scattered beta-HCG positive syncytiotrophoblastic cells are seen. There is no convincing choriocarcinoma. Focal intratubular germ cell neoplasia is present on PLAP staining.
AJCC Tumour staging category (pT) (7th edition)
T1 	Tumour limited to the testis and epididymis without vascular/lymphatic invasion
DIAGNOSIS:
Left testis: 38mm mixed germ cell tumour (70% teratoma, 20% embryonal carcinoma, 10% yolk sac tumour), confined to testis (pT1, AJCC 7th Ed.), margins clear
