CLINICAL:
Submental recurrence SCC.  Main specimen - submental/submandibular mass.  Deep margin of main specimen.  Left level 2-4 neck dissection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "submental mass" consists of an excision of skin which measures 170 x 120mm to a depth of 40mm.  The epidermalsurface contains a scar which measures 30mm in length.  There is a central nodular mass which measures 35 x 35mm which is located 45mm from the closest skin margin.  On sectioning the tumour appears to have a depth of 40mm and is abuttingthe deep margin.  Deep margin is inked black.  The lesion appears to have a central cavity which measures 17mm x 10mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - composite blocks  full section at level of deepest invasion; 3 & 4 - composite blocks full section of tumour at level of deepest invasion; 5 - closest peripheral skin margin; 6 - peripheral skin margin; 7 & 8 - composite blocks and peripheral skin margin; 9 & 10 - longitudinal sections of the most lateral skin margin.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 2 to 4 neck dissection" consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue which measures 50 x 10 x 100mm.  The specimen is unorientated.  No submandibular gland is identified.  
Blocks:  1 to 6 - lymph nodes; 7 - one lymph node bisected; 8 - one lymph node bisected; 9to 14 - lymph nodes.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Deep margin of main specimen" consists of a piece of fibrous tissue measuring 10 x 7 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (GD/mm 14.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Respress):  
A.  Sections show a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal keratinisation.  The carcinoma has a depth of invasion of 40mm.  The carcinoma is incompletely excised and extends to the deep margin over a broad area (block A4).  There is no evidence oflymphatic, vascular or perineural invasion.
B.  Twenty one (21) lymph nodes are identified in total.  1 of 21 lymph nodes is involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  There is 1mm extranodal spread.
C.  Sections show skeletal muscle infiltrated by a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  The tumour is incompletely excised.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Submental mass - Squamous cell carcinoma.
B.  Level 2 to 4 neck dissection - Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving 1 of 21 lymph nodes (1/21).
C.  Deep margin of main specimen - Squamous cell carcinoma.
