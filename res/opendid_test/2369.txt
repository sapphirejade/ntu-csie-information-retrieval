Endometrialcancer.  Coeliac.  Osteopenia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Bilateral tubes and ovaries, uterus, cervix" and consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 92g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 55 x 35mm and has an unremarkable serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is an exophytic tan tumour on the anterior uterine wall measuring 20 x 25mm, 50mm from the cervical os.  There is an exophytic lesion on the posterior uterine wall over 10 x 10mm, 45mm from the cervical os.  On sectioning the tumour appears to be confined to the inner half of the myometrium and measures 6mm in depth.  The myometrium measures 12mm in maximum thickness and is otherwise unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length x 6 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 45 x 8 x 6mm and has nodular excrescences on the serosal surface.  The left ovary measures 16 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 & 5 - anterior left endometrium; 6 & 7 - anterior left endometrium; 8 to 10 LS posterior body and cervix; 11 to 13 - posterior right endometrium with tumour; 14 - fibroid posterior myometrium; 15 & 16 - right fallopian tube; 17 - right ovary; 18 & 19 - left fallopian tube; 20 - left ovary.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Beninato):
Sections show endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium comprising in a backgroundof complex hyperplasia with atypia.  The tumour is mostly composed of confluent glands with little intervening stroma and focal areas of squamous and mucinous differentiation.  The minimal solid component and nuclear features are compatible with FIGO grade 1.  The majority of the tumour is confined to the uterus displaying exophytic and expansile growth pattern.  Multiple foci of superficial myometrial invasion are identified up to 1.5mm deep where the corresponding myometrium is 14mm in maximum thickness.  There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  
Extensive adenomyosis is present with focal tumoral extension.  The posterior wall leiomyoma shows no atypical features.  The adjacent endometriumdemonstrates changes compatible with progestogen effect.
The ectocervix and endocervix show no evidence of glandular or stromal tumour involvement.  No tumour is seen in the adnexae. 
Cervix, ovaries, and tubes display benign elements only. 
DIAGNOSIS: 
Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, and ovaries:
-  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, Grade 1.
-  Multifocal early myometrial invasion (<2mm) into the inner half of the myometrium.
-  No lymphovascular space invasion.
-  Extensive adenomyosis and a benign leiomyoma.
-  No involvement of cervix or adnexae.
