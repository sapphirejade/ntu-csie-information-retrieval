CLINICAL:
Left breast 6 x 5cm phyllodes tumour - Left mastectomy + sentinel node biopsy.  Short superior long lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel lymph node left axilla", consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 35 x 20 x 10mm.  One lymph node is identified 28mm across. 
Blocks: 1 and 2 - one lymph node. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast wide local excision left breast short - superior, long  - lateral, medial - medial", consists of a mastectomy with orienting sutures.  The specimen is 175mm (medial to lateral) x 160mm (superior to inferior) x 30mm (superficial to deep).  There is overlying ellipse of skin, 130 x 50mm.  The nipple-areola complex appears unremarkable.  There is a possible core biopsy site over the skin ellipse at 2 o'clock 3cm FN.  Within the upper outer quadrant, centred at 2 o'clock 3.5cm FN is a circumscribed pale grey tumour, 55 x 27 x 45mm.  There is a possible area with an infiltrative border towards the medial end of the mass.  The mass is 2mm clear of the deep margin and 12mm clear of the superficial margin.  The mass is 45mm clear of the closest peripheral margin (inferior).  No other lesions are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - medial aspect of mass; 2 and 3 - medial tumour with possible infiltrative boarder; 4 - superior border of tumour; 5 to 7 - tumour with closest deep margin; 8 - tumour with closestsuperficial margin; 9 - central tumour; 10 - lateral aspect of tumour; 11 - upper outer quadrant; 12 - lower outer quadrant; 13 - lower inner quadrant; 14 - upper inner quadrant; 15 - nipple.  Tumour sampled fresh for tumour banking.   (TO: XS;GO/vo 17 2.2066) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Ordal):
A. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show breast tissue with a 55mm Phyllodes tumour.  The lesion is predominantly circumscribed, with focal permeation the adjacent fat.  Mild to moderately increased stromal cellularity is seen.  The stromal cells show moderate atypia with up to 7 mitoses being present per hpf. No definite stromal overgrowth is present ina low power field. No malignant heterologous elements are identified.
The Phyllodes tumour is 1.3mm from the nearest deep margin, 12mm from the superficial margin, and is >20mm from the other margins.
Within the Phyllodes tumour, there are occasional, scattered foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia, all less than 2mm in size, which are > 10mm clear of the margins. These foci are composed of cribriform glands with diffuse strong staining for ER. Myoepithelial/basal cells are confined to the periphery. No convincing DCIS is seen.
The adjacent breast tissue and nipple appear unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Left axillary sentinel lymph node: 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
B. Left breast: 55mm borderline Phyllodes tumour
