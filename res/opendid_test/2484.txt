CLINICAL:
High anterior resection of sigmoid cancer.  Ischaemic toe.  IHD.  T2DM.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "High anterior resection" and consists of a segment of colon measuring 290mm in length with attached mesenteric fatty tissue up to 85mm across.  The colon is peritonealised up to the distal margin.  There is a circumferential ulcerated tumour 82 x 75 x 18mm.  The tumour is 120mm from proximal and 115mm from distal resection margins.  The tumour infiltrates the mesenteric fattytissue extensively.  The tumour comes very close to the peritonealised surface.  The tumour is 70mm from the closest mesenteric cut margin.  
Blocks: 1 - shave proximal margin; 2 - shave distal margin; 3 & 4 - TSof tumour including serosa; 5 - LS tumour and adjacent normal looking mucosa; 6 & 7 - TS tumour close to peritonealised surface (block 7 - reserve block); 8 - TS tumour; 9 - one bisected lymph node closeto tumour; 10 - apical lymph node; 11 - lymph nodes as seen; 12 - lymph nodes as seen; 13 to 17 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" and consists ofa donut shaped piece of colon 18 x 15 x 15mm.  The staples are removed and the remainder AE 2 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Turbacuski)
A.  The sigmoid colon tumour is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A synoptic report for colorectal carcinoma follows: 
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA
Macroscopic Description
Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon. 	
Maximum tumour diameter: 82mm.
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 115mm (distal margin). 
Tumour perforation: No (carcinoma is very close to the serosal surface (0.25mm), however, no definite direct serosal involvement is seen). 
Microscopic Description
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour is present in the subserosal fibroadipose tissue, including a focus 0.25mm from the serosal surface. 
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: Fourteen (14). 	
Number of lymph nodes involved: None (0/14). 
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Focus suspicious for LVSI (A3).
Perineural invasion
Focus suspicious for perineural invasion (A3).
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Nil significant. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Not applicable. 
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6	nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
pTNM STAGE (7th Edition): 2A (pT3N0Mx)	

B.  Sections are of colon wall. There is noevidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  High anterior resection: 
82mm, pTNM IIA, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon.
Very close to serosal surface (0.25mm). 
Surgical margins appear clear.
No evidence of malignancy in fourteen lymph nodes. 
There is loss of nuclear staining for mismatch repair enzymes MLH1 and PMS2 which may reflect an underlying germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.


B.  Distal donut: No evidence of malignancy.
