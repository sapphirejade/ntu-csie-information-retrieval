CLINICAL NOTES:
High grade appendix tumour
Gallbladder, peritoneum, Rt colon, uterus

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, UTERUS, CERVIX&amp;quot;.  A gallbladder, omentum, right hemicolectomy and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue ?peritoneum.

The gallbladder measures 90mm in length with a maximum diameter of 45mm.  It is intact.  The serosa is unremarkable.  The wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosa is granular green with yellow streaks.  No stones are found within the lumen.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus;

The omentum measures 630x300x25mm.  Possible mucinous deposits are identified.

3&amp;amp;4 RS of omentum;

The right hemicolectomy measures 400mm in length (terminal ileum 190mm, ascending colon 210mm).  The appendix is not present.  At this site the serosa is roughened consistent with previous resection.  The serosa of the remainder of the large and small bowel shows areas of focal roughening ?adhesion.  The attached mesocolic fat is up to 100mm wide.  On opening, the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds.  No discrete lesion identified.  Proximal margin is inked blue, distal black.

5 margins; 6 roughened serosa terminal ileum; 7 roughened serosa ascending colon; 8 appendiceal stump; 9 four possible nodes; 10 one node bisected; 11 one node bisected;

Uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and anterior peritoneum.  The posterior margin inked blue, anterior black.  It weighs 180g in total and measures 70mm superior to inferior, 35mm intercornual distance, the ectocervix is 25x25mm with an ovoid os 2mm.  It is skin-coloured and unremarkable.  The attached peritoneum anteriorly is up to 100mm wide.  The serosal surface is somewhat roughened.  At the pouch of Douglas there is mucinous material.  Anterior endomyometrium is 15mm, posterior endomyometrium is 16mm.  The endometrium is less than 1mm thick.  In the uterus, there is a possible nodule 5mm with a pale white whorled appearance.

12 anterior cervix; 13 posterior cervix; 14 anterior endomyometrium; 15 posterior endomyometrium; 16 pouch of Douglas with mucinous debris; 17 right fallopian tube; 18 peritoneum anterior to cervix; 19 nodule with pale white whorled appearance.

Multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum in aggregate 200x130x30mm.  There is a calcified nodule floating in formalin measuring 11mm.

20 calcified nodule and section of peritoneum.  RS (M-20/MC 14/6/2067 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. T. Gravitz)
The gallbladder shows mild chronic cholecystitis with some thickening of the muscular layer.

The omental fat shows small surface deposits of acellular mucin mixed with fibrous bands and inflammation.

The small bowel terminal ileum serosa shows a deposit of mucin with intermixed inflammatory cells and reactive mesothelial cells.  A similar deposit is present on the ascending colon serosa and adjacent to the appendiceal stump.  There are six benign lymph nodes identified.

The uterine ectocervix is unremarkable.  The endocervix shows Nabothian cysts.  The endometrium is atrophic.  The myometrium shows endosalpingiosis underlying the serosal surface.  A tiny amount of mucinous material is present attached to the anterior surface of the uterus (block 14).  A small amount of mucin with intermixed vessels is attached to the fallopian tube, which is otherwise unremarkable.  A small benign leiomyoma is present in the uterus.  The peritoneal fragments are lined by reactive mesothelial cells, tiny amounts of mucin with inflammatory cells, and the calcified nodule is a focus of fat necrosis with surrounding fibrosis.

There is no mucinous epithelium within the mucin deposits, and no signet-ring cells.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, UTERUS, CERVIX
-  SMALL FOCI OF ACELLULAR MUCIN PRESENT ON BOWEL SEROSA, SURFACE OF THE UTERUS AND OMENTUM
