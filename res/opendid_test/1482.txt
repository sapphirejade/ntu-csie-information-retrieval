CLINICAL:
69 yr old woman with previous diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2056.  Now presents with massive abdominal mass causing pressure symptoms.  Ovarian - primary or metastatic.  Intra-op: no ascites, massive right ovary filled with litres of serous fluid, solid and cystic areas.  Right tube, left tube and left ovary all normal.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right ovarian tumour", received fresh, consists of a large fragment of cystic wall measuring 12 x 10 x 2mm.  The external and internal surfaces are smooth.  No papillary excrescences are seen.  There are also two large fragments of blood clot 6 x 4 x 4mm and 5 x 5 x 3mm and a more solid fragment of pink soft tissue with areas of haemorrhage measuring 20x 20 x 10mm.  Tissue from the cystic wall and a solid fragment taken for frozen section.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - frozen section; 3 to 5 - representative cyst wall and mass.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Torted, only a small amount of viable epithelium.  Probably metastatic colonic carcinoma.
Phone results to Prof. OLonny by Dr. O Streff at 9:50am on 10.11.63
B.  Specimen labelled "Right ovarian tumour", consists of an ovarian mass measuring 150 x 150 x 85mm.  The mass is solid and cystic.  The cystic areas are smooth lined and filled with a haemoserous fluid.  The solid areas are composed of complex structures with tight nodular spaces filled with tan papillary excrescences.  Areas of haemorrhage and necrosis are identified.  A fallopian tube is identified measuring 110mm in length x 8 x 6mm in maximum diameter.  The fallopian tube is adherent to the ovarian mass.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - ovarian tumour; 6 and 7 - fallopian tube; 8 - biobank tumour block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary", consists of a fallopian tube measuring 50mm in length x 8 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The ovary measures 30 x 15 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - fallopian tube; 3 - ovary.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 160 x 105 x 18mm.  The omentum is covered with a fibrinous haemorrhagic exudate.  No nodules or masses are identified.  Representative in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Janocha):
A.  Paraffin sections confirmed fragments of adenocarcinoma.
B.  Sections of ovary show extensive involvement by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with columnar epithelium and extensive luminal necrosis.  The tumour cells show positive staining with CDX2 and focal staining with CK20.  The CK7 and CA125 stains are negative.  The morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  
C.  Sections of ovary show a few benign simple serous cysts.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
D.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS: 
A - D.  Right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, omentum:
- Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma within the right ovary.
- Left ovary and both tubes normal 
- Omentum negative
