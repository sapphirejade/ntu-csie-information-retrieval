Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for body and tail main duct dilatation - cytology mucinous.  ?IPMN and tail nodule - neuroendocrine on FNA ?complete excision.
Radiology:  CT (25/10/69) - mild to moderate dilation of main pancreatic duct ?IPMN.  Also a 9 x 8mm nodule in pancreatic tail ?neuroendocrine tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Distal pancreas&amp;quot;, consists of a distal pancreas (65 x 62 x 18mm), spleen (130 x 68 x 82mm; 48g), and omental tissue (480 x 55 x 30mm).  The surfaces of the pancreas, spleen, and omental tissue are smooth and shiny.  The superior surface of the pancreas is inked red, anterior pancreatic surface is inked blue, and the posterior pancreatic surface is inked black.  The pancreas is sectioned transversely from proximal to distal into twelve approximately equal slices.  The main pancreatic duct appears dilated and expanded by microcystic areas over the entirety of its length (including the distal tip).  The main pancreatic duct measures up to 10mm in diameter, with the associated microcystic areas exending over an area of approximately 16 x 14mm.  A shave of the pancreatic neck margin is embedded for frozen section in two blocks.  The cut surface of the spleen shows no significant abnormality; tumour is not identified.  No tumour is identified within the omental and splenic hilum fibroadipose tissue.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one (superior half pancreatic neck margin); 2 - frozen section two (inferior half pancreatic neck margin); 3 &amp;amp; 4 - slice one pancreas (proximal); 5 &amp;amp; 6 - slice two pancreas; 7 &amp;amp; 8 - slice three pancreas; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - slice four pancreas; 11 &amp;amp; 12 - slice five pancreas; 13 &amp;amp; 14 - slice six pancreas; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - slice seven pancreas; 17 &amp;amp; 18 - slice eight pancreas; 19 &amp;amp; 20 - slice nine pancreas; 21 &amp;amp; 22 - slice ten pancreas; 23 &amp;amp; 24 - slice eleven pancreas; 25 &amp;amp; 26 - slice twelve pancreas (distal); 27 - splenic hilum; 28 &amp;amp; 29 - spleen; 30 to 33 - splenic hilum fibroadipose tissue, lymph nodes as seen; 34 to 36 - omental tissue.  Complete pancreas embedded.  See diagram.  (TO:JB/rs 9/2/69)

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
IPMN at pancreatic neck margin.  No high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma seen.
Phone result to Dr Tomas by Dr D Aplington/Dr D Ferndez at 11:10hrs 10/02/69.


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Satava):
Sections of the pancreatic body and tail show an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) extending the entire length of the pancreas (approximately 60mm).  The epithelium is of a gastric type and shows low to intermediate grade dysplasia.  Tumour involves both the main pancreatic duct and numerous branch ducts.  IPMN with intermediate grade dysplasia is present at the pancreatic neck margin.  The entire specimen is examined and no high grade dysplasia or invasive malignancy is seen.
In addition, two neuroendocrine tumours measuring 3 and 8mm are identified within the pancreatic tail.  The tumours shows positive staining with CD56 and synaptophysin.  The larger is also positive for chromogranin.  The larger tumour shows 1 mitosis per 10 high power field and the smaller tumour shows no mitoses.  No necrosis is seen.  The Ki-67 index is both tumours is less than 1%.  Both tumours appear completely excised.  The spleen shows no significant abnormality.

The overall features as follows:

Histological tumour type
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)
Neuroendocrine tumour (x2)

Histological grade
IPMN - low to intermediate grade
Neuroendocrine tumour - grade 1.
