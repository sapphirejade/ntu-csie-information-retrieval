CLINICAL:
Splenectomy + cholecystectomy.  MDS/myeloproliferative disorder.  50 yr pkt hx. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder", consists of an unopened gallbladder measuring 110mm in length x 50 x 50mm in maximum dimension.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The wall thickness is 2mm and the mucosa is dark green and trabeculated. There are multiple gallstones received within the gallbladder lumen measuring 8-10mm in maximum dimension.  There is one cystic duct lymph node measuring 3mm in maximum dimension.  Block 1-proximal surgical margin, neck and lymph node; 2 - body; 3 - fundus. 
Extra blocks of fundus in a further six blocks from blocks 4 to 9.  (RS/bl 19/8/64)
B.  Specimen labelled "Spleen", consists of a spleen weighing 1967g in total.  The spleen was received fresh.  The spleen measures 230 x 190 x 100mm.  There is a smooth undisrupted capsule.  The splenic hilum measures 120 x 35mm in area. The cut surface shows a homogeneous brown appearance with no discrete lesions identified macroscopically.  Multiple hilar lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3-5mm in maximum dimension.  Block 1- vascular margin - shave; 2-6 - representative spleen; 7 & 8 - lymph nodes as seen. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Splenunculus", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissuemeasuring 42 x 20 x 5mm.  There is a firm brown lesion within the tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 5mm.  The nodule has a smooth capsule and the cut surface shows a uniform brown cut surface.  No other lesions are identified within the fatty tissue. The nodule is AE in 2 blocks. (TO: PQ;NL/ec  14.8.64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported byDr X Reels/Dr X Grass)
A.  Sections of gallbladder show mild chronic cholecystitis. There is mild fibromuscular wall thickening and patchy mild non-specificchronic inflammation. The gallbladder has been extensively sampled and also shows foci of intestinal metaplasia and low grade dysplasia. The cystic duct margin is clear of dysplasia. There is no evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy. A single pericholecystic lymph node shows focal extramedullary haematopoiesis with no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
B.  Sections of spleen show marked expansion of red pulp by extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. There are scattered admixed haemosiderin laden macrophages. Eleven sampled lymph nodes show focal extramedullary haematopoiesis (0/11). There is no evidence of malignancy.  
C.  Sections confirm the presence of a splenunculus which shows extramedullary haematopoiesis. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Gallbladder: Mild chronic cholecystitis, intestinal metaplasia and focal low grade dysplasia. A single reactive pericholecystic lymph node is present and shows extramedullary haematopoiesis (0/1). No evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy.

B. Splenectomy: Extramedullary haematopoiesis. No evidence of malignancy in eleven lymph nodes (0/11).

C.  Splenunculus: Extramedullary haematopoiesis.
