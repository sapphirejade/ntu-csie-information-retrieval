CLINICAL:
Hx breast cancer - family.  Complex hyperplasia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes, left ovary, cervix" and consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and a left ovary weighing 213g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 40 x 90mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 25mm in maximum thickness.  There is an IUD in situ.  On sectioning the myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 85mm in length 7mm in diameter.  There is a paratubal cyst, 10 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 50 x 35 x 25mm.  The sectioning of the left ovary shows a solid cystic cut surface (multiple cysts along the cortex, ranging from 3 to 6mm).  All cysts are uniloculated.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - anterior body and cervix; 7 to 10- left anterior wall parasagittal sections (6 and 7, 8 and 9 are paired sections); 11 to 18 - right anterior wall, serially embedded from midline to lateral (11, 12 & 13,14 & 15 are paired sections); 19 to 23 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 24 to 29 - right posterior wall serially embedded from midline to lateral (24 & 25, 26 & 27, paired sections); 30 to 37 - left posterior wall, serially embedded from midline to periphery, (30 & 31, 32 & 33, 34 & 35 are paired sections); 38 - LS fimbrial end and paratubal cyst; 39 - LS right fimbria end; 40 to 43 - TS right fallopian tube; 44 - LS left fimbrial end; 45 to 47 - TS left tube AE; 48 to 56 - left ovary AE (48 to 50, 51 to 53, 54 to 56, 57 to 60, 61 & 62, 64 & 65 are composite sections). Both tubes, left ovary and endometrial cavity are all embedded. (TO: ELISHA; Lincoln/ta 28/10/65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Spuck):
The entire endometrium has been embedded for assessment.  Sections show mainly proliferative endometrium marked by mitotically active tortuous glands with focal metaplastic changes.  Multiple small foci (blocks 18, 34, 36) demonstrate glandular crowding with minimum intervening stroma.  These glands are lined by stratified cells with enlarged rounded nuclei, coarse chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.  Features are in keeping with atypical complex hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  The myometrium shows focal superficial adenomyosis.
The cervix demonstrates no significant abnormality.  A focal area adjacent to the transformation zone is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, accompanied by haemorrhage, haemosiderin deposition, and giant cell reaction.  These changes are suggestive of recentsurgical procedure.  No features of dysplasia or malignancy are evident.
The left ovary contains multiple cystic follicles with variable distribution.  There is no significant superficial cortical thickening and no stromal hyperthecosis.  Hyperplasia of the follicular luteinized theca interna cells is not a prominent feature.  There are numerous primordial follicles present.  Corpora albicantia and atretic follicles can be seen.  An incidental epidermoid cyst is also identified.  The appearances fall short of the diagnosis of polycystic ovary.  
The fallopian tubes show benign developmental structures.  A right paratubal cyst is noted.  No significant abnormality can be seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS: 
Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, left ovary:
	Focal complex hyperplasia with atypia.
	Adenomyosis.
	Unremarkable cervix.
	Multiple cystic follicles and epidermoid cyst of the left ovary.
	Right paratubal cyst.
