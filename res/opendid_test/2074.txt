HISTORY:
Ovarian cancer. Peritonectomy. Pelvic mass, peritoneal disease. Appendix, rectum, diaphragm, liver. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE". A piece of pale tissue, measuring  12mm in maximum extent. AE (M-1).
B. "PERITONEAL DISEASE, PELVIC APPENDIX MASS, RECTUM, LIVER DIAPHRAGM". Multiple pieces of representing tumour adherent to liver, bowel, omentum, possibly peritoneum. There is separate appendix in the container. The larger deposition of tumour attached to bowel weighs 1700g. The rest of the small deposits of tumour weigh 829g. The appendix measures 55mm in length with diameter of up to 7mm. There is a possible deposit of tumour seen in the serosa of the appendix measuring7mm in maximum extent. 
(1 distal appendix; 2 body of the appendix; 3 proximal appendix). 
The larger deposit of tumour with attached bowel measures 210x170x140mm. The loop of large bowel attached to the tumourmeasures about 400mm in length with circumference of up to 90mm.  The loop of the bowel cannot be orientated. The bowel appears very oedematous. The tumour is sectioned transversely and appears necrotic at the centre with cavity and the tumour appears pale white and fleshy. There are multiple haemorrhages identified within the tumour. 
(4 LS of margin 1 of the bowel; 5 LS of margin 2 of the bowel; 6-13 RS of the tumour). The second largest deposition of tumourmeasures 130x120x60mm. There is a piece of liver attached to the specimen to a piece of tissue. It measures 50x50x25mm. 
(14 RS of the tumour attached to liver; 15-18 RS of the tumour). 
Smaller deposits of tumourare all sectioned transversely. 
(19-23 sectioned from small deposition of tumour). RS (M-23/KE/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr M Somma)
A. No evidence of malignancy is seen in one lymph node.
B. Histology shows all of the deposits of tumour to be poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma consistent with an ovarian/Mullerian origin. The tumour has a solid and trabecular pattern but with some areas showing well defined acinar structures. The nuclei are high-grade with easily identifiable mitotic activity. Ki67 is approximately 30-40%. Deposits of tumour are found overly capsule the liver, serosa of the colon and appendix also over the surface of the diaphragm. No direct infiltration of these organs is present. Immunostains show positivity for WT1, patchy staining for CK 7, p16, p53 and Pax-8. ER shows weak to moderate intensively staining of 60% of nuclei. PR and CK 20 are negative. The mucosa of the colon and appendix are otherwise unremarkable.
Comment: The morphology and immunoprofile is identical to that of the previous tumour resection specimen which has been reviewed for comparison (46Y3878) which is that of a high-grade ovarian carcinoma showing endometrioid and serous features. Correlation with the clinical findings is required.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN ONE NODE.
B. PERITONEAL DISEASE, PELVIC APPENDIX MASS, RECTUM, LIVER DIAPHRAGM
- METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED OVARIAN CARCINOMA.
