CLINICAL:
Sarcoma R medial thigh.  Pre-op chemo-radiotherapy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tumour right leg, short stitch = superior, double stitch deep, long stitch lateral" consists of muscle with attached fascia and adipose tissue measuring 175mm (superior to inferior) x 120mm (medial to lateral) x 70mm (superficial to deep).  There are three sutures orientating short superior, double deep and long lateral.  The specimen is inked as follows: lateral - green, deep - black, anterior - red, and serially sectioned from superior to inferior.  On sectioning there is a predominately cystic gelatinous tumour within muscle, 80 x 90 x approximately 150mm from superior to inferior.  The margins are as follows: 3mm lateral, 15mm medial, 3mm anterior, 2mm deep, 27mmsuperior and approximately 50mm inferior.  The majority of the tumour is cystic and necrotic.  The superior portion of the tumour appears more viable and has a gelatinous architecture.  Representative sections.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - superior margin slice one; 3 & 4 - inferior margin; 5 & 6 - lateral margin; 7 & 8 - superficial margin; 9 & 10 - medial margin; 11 - deep margin; 12 to 15 - viable tumour (15 - tumour for biobank).  
B.  Specimen labelled "Superficial margin right leg" and consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin measuring 205 x 55mm to a depth of 10mm.  The skin appears unremarkable.  The subcutaneous tissue continues to fascia.  The deep aspect is inked black.  No tumour is identified on sectioning.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.   (JR/ta 17/12/65) 
 
  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr U Griggs): 
A.  Sections show a high grade undifferentiated sarcoma with similar morphology to that seen within the previous biopsy (84W64879).  The tumour consists of sheets of highly atypical spindle cells with pleomorphic, occasionally multinucleated nuclei with vacuolated chromatin.  Atypical mitotic figures are present.  There is extensive necrosis, estimated as approximately 60%, related to therapy.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  Excision appears complete with the inferior margin 1mm clear, the lateral and superficial margins 2mm clear and other margins well clear.  
B.  Sections show skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right leg:  Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, margins clear.  
B.  Superficial margin right leg:  No significant abnormality.
