MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Bruening):
A.  Sections show well differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, foamy gland type.  The tumour measures approximately 55mm across and extends almost the entire length of the pancreatic tail. Tumour focally extends into peripancreatic adipose tissue.  Six (6) of the twenty three (23) lymph nodes identified contain metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  The single (1) lymph node identified contains a focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

C.  The nine (9) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

D.  The single (1) lymph node identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

E.  The single (1) lymph node identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

The overall features are as follows:
