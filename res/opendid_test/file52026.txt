CLINICAL NOTES:
Frozen section ileocolic anastomosis.
Peritonectomy specimen (redo colorectal), vaginal vault, rectum, small bowel, right ureter, colon nodule.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS&amp;quot;.  Consists of a piece of soft red tissue 4mm maximum dimension.

F/S : &amp;quot;Extracellular mucin with a small amount of epithelium ? origin (? misplaced from bowel mucosa) ? ? tumour&amp;quot;.  Reported to Dr. Brommer (Surgical Registrar) by Dr. A. Pangallo at 11:00 am on 16.07.67.  AE (1-1)

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL, VAGINA, GALLBLADDER, RECTUM&amp;quot;.  Consists of a gallbladder, a segment of short bowel, a segment of large bowel and a piece of tissue covered by mucosa consistent with vaginal vault.  The gallbladder measures 95mm in length with a maximum diameter of 20mm. The serosa appears unremarkable.  The wall of the gallbladder is up to 3mm thick.  Mucosa is granular green in appearance.  No stones are found within the lumen.
(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus)

Segment of small bowel measures 50mm in length with a maximum diameter of 25mm.  The serosal surface shows a focal area that&amp;#8217;s a bit firm. On sectioning through this area the cut surface is pale, white in appearance.  No discrete lesion is noted within the mucosa. One margin inked blue, the other black.

(3 margins; 4 section through firm are)

Segment of bowel consistent with large bowel.  It measures 120mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm.  The serosa is roughened and on opening no discrete lesion is noted.  There are multiple areas of disruption, appears iatrogenic.  One end is inked blue (non stapled end), opposite margin (stapled) inked black.  Due to the nature of the specimen anterior and posterior aspects cannot be accurately identified.

(5 margins; 6 two sections through roughened serosa)

Vagina includes a short segment of tubular tissue consistent with ureter.  The entire specimen measures 60x40x30mm.  There is one aspect covered by mucosa, this area measures 50x30mm.  The short segment of tubular tissue ?  ureter measures 20mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  Resection margin is inked blue. On sectioning through the vaginal tissue the attached fat shows infiltrative tumour with a pale white appearance.  The lesion comes up to the resection margin and underlies the vaginal mucosa.
(7 margin ureter; 8 two further sections of ureter; 9 section of vaginal mucosa; 10-12 full face section of vaginal vault including relationship of lesion to mucosa and margins; 13 lesion in relation to margin; 14 lesion in relation to deep margin of vaginal vault and ureter).  RS (M-14)

C.  &amp;quot;COLON NODULE&amp;quot;. Consists of one piece of tissue, fibrous 5mm maximum dimension.  AE (1-1/MC 21/7/2070 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. A. Moulton)
A. Sections show colonic mucosa with underlying extracellular mucin associated with scattered bland epithelial cells ? displaced from colonic mucosa.

COMMENT:
The exact nature of the extrvasated mucin is not certain. The adenocarcinoma in specimen B has different morphology is poorly differentiated and does not have a mucinous component.

.B. Sections show poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma involving small bowel serosa and vaginal and pericervical soft tissue including extending into vaginal stroma to undermine overlying normal squamous epithelium. Extensive lymphovascular and perineural invasion by the carcinoma is seen. The carcinoma is seen to extend into periureteric soft tissue but does not appear to involve the ureter.
The ureter sand small bowel show no intrinic abnormality.

Sections through the gallbladder and separately submitted rectal segment are also unremarkable with no evidence of tumour. A single lymph node recovered from the rectal specimen shows reactive changes.

C. Sections show colonic wall with areas of acute on chronically inflamed granulation tissue in the muscularis. There is no evidence of tumour.

DIAGNOSIS:
ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS:
- DEPOSIT OF EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN WITH DISPLACED EPITHELIUM (SEE COMMENT)
SMALL BOWEL, VAGINA, GALLBLADDER, RECTUM:
- POORLY-DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING VAGINA, PERICERVICAL SOFT TISSUES AND SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY.
COLON NODULE:
- COLONIC WALL WITH ACUTE ON CHRONICALLY INFLAMED GRANULATION TISSUE.
