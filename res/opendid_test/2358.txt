MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 54g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 28 x 15mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 28 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Thereis also a shelf of vaginal mucosa extending posteriorly over approximately 25 x 8mm.  The vaginal mucosa has haemorrhagic areas however no lesion is seen macroscopically.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is up to 9mm in thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 58mm in length x 7 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 20 x 11 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopiantube measures 58mm in length x 6 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 22 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The cervix and vaginal flap are all embedded.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 and 5 - left anterior cervix; 6 to 8 -right anterior cervix; 9 to 11 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 12 to 15 - left cervix and vaginal flap; 16 to19 - right cervix and vaginal flap; 20 - right fallopian tube; 21 - right ovary; 22 - left fallopian tube; 23 - left ovary.  (TO: OC;CV/vo 13.4.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Kawata)
The ectocervix and vaginal mucosa appear largely denuded and obscured by severediathermy change. However, in areas, there is some partially intact squamous epithelium which shows no convincing HPV effect, CIN or VAIN. The endocervix shows no significant abnormality. There is a localised foreign body type reaction toprobable diathermy within the cervical stroma, likely representing a previous biopsy site. The endometrium shows cystic atrophy. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus: 
Cervical and vaginal squamous mucosa largely denuded and obscured by severe diathermy artefact. 
Foci of residual intact cervical and vaginal squamous epithelium show no diagnostic evidence of HPV effect, CIN or VAIN. 
There is no significant glandular dysplasia or evidence of malignancy.
