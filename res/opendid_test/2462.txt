SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: MSI IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Dr L Luchterhand (9.6.2065)

CLINICAL:
TAHBSO for grade 1 endometrial carcinoma.   Class 3 obesity, BMI 46.  Hypertension.  Impaired glucose tolerance.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" and consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tube and ovaries weighing 132g in total.  The uterus withcervix is 80 x 65 x 58mm.  The ectocervix is 20 x 18mm.  Within the endometrial cavity is an exophytic tan tumour, 20 x 15 x 5mm.   No definite myometrial invasion is seen.  The myometrium is up to 25mm thick.  The right ovary is 25 x 22x 10mm, and the right fallopian tube is 70mm in length.  The left ovary is 25 x 18 x 10mm and the left fallopian tube is 70mm in length.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS section anterior body and cervix; 5 - anterior tumour; 6to 11 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 12 - exophytic component of tumour (reserve block); 13 - right ovary; 14 - right fallopian tube; 15 - left ovary and fallopian tube.  
(TO: HK; XS/ta 4/6/65)   
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr L Edelson)
Sections of the endometrial tumour show a Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is predominantly exophytic and consists of adenocarcinoma cells arranged in complex,crowded glands with minimal intervening stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). The carcinoma shows widespread extension along tracts of adenomyosis into the myometrium. However, focally, adenocarcinoma appears to infiltrate into the myometrium with focal desmoplastic response, to a maximum depth of 2.2mm intoa uterine wall 25mm. A single focus suspicious of lymphovascular space invasion is seen. No uterine serosa, cervical or ovarian involvement by carcinoma is identified. 
The non-neoplastic endometrium shows background changes of cystic atrophy with patchy atypical complex endometrial hyperplasia. The cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes: 
FIGO Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.
