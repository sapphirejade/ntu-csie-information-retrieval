CLINICAL:
Lateral segment of remnant/residual/regenerated right hemiliver.
1. Right upper segment.
2. Right lateral.
3. Hilar lymph nodes.
Metastatic colorectal cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right upper lesion", consists of a wedge of liver, 48 x 45 x 20mm, weighing 22g.  There is a small amount of hepatic capsule, which appears unremarkable.  The margin is inked blue.  Within the liver there is a circumscribed tan tumour, 25 x 20 x 20mm.  The tumour appears to abut the surgical margin.  The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - tumour for uninvolved liver.

B.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral", consists of a segment of liver 75 x 55 x 35mm, weighing 81g.  The hepatic capsule is unremarkable.  The margin is inked blue.  Within the liver is a circumscribed pale tumour nodule, 38 x 30 x 45mm.  The lesion is less than 1mm clearof the hepatic capsule, and appears to abut the margin.  The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - tumour with closest margin; 4 - tumour with hepatic capsule; 5 - uninvolved liver.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Hilar node", consists of a piece of adipose tissue 45 x 20 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified 15 and 20mm across.  
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node; 2 and 3 - larger lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Bisel):
A & B. The sections of liver show multiple tumourdeposits of viable adenocarcinoma. The tumour deposits are composed of irregular complex glands lined by pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli and numerous mitoses. The tumour deposits show dystrophic calcification and areas of luminal necrosis and fibrosis. Viable tumour extends to the inked surgical margin in specimens A and B.  The adenocarcinoma shows similar features as seen in specimen (77N91628).  The adjacent liver shows mild steatosis and a mild increase in portal lymphocytes and plasma cells, of uncertain significance. The histological features are consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. 
C. Sections showtwo negative lymph nodes.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A & B.  Right upper and right lateral segments of liver: 
-   Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin.
-   Chances consistent with neoadjuvant therapy.
-   Metastatic adenocarcinoma extends to the surgical margins.
C.  Hilar nodes:  Two negative lymph nodes (0/2)
