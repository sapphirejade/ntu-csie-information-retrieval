CLINICAL:
36f with newly diagnosed cervical cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes weighing 140g in total. The uterus measures 100 x 65 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The soft tissue margin is inked blue anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 55 x 40mm.  There is a cervical tumour involving the ectocervix and the endocervical canal 42 x 25 x 15mm.  Most of the bulk of the tumour is anterior.  The cervix is sliced radially and sequentially blocked clockwise, starting from 10 o'clock.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 16mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube is 60mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 56mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 17 - anterior cervix from 10 towards 3 o'clock (4 & 5 - paired; 6 & 7 - paired; 8 & 9 - paired; 10 & 11 paired; 12 & 13 - paired; 14 & 15 - paired); 18 to 30 - posterior cervix from 4 to 9 o'clock (Blocks 1, 17, 18 & 30 are en face); 31 to 33 - full LS of anterior body; 34 to 37 - full LS posterior body; 38 - representative right fallopian tube; 39 - representative left fallopian tube.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 45 x20 x 6mm.  Specimen is sliced, no lymph nodes are identified.  AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30 x15 x 3mm.  There is one likely lymph node 3mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - ?one lymph node; 2 - the remaining tissue.  AE.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 30 x 10mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified 20 and 12mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one trisected lymph node; 3 to 5 - remainder of the tissue.   AE.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a lymph node and attached fatty tissue measuring 45 x 35 x 12mm in aggregate.  Up to four lymph nodes are identified ranging from 12 to 17mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - each one lymph node.  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 10mm in aggregate.  A few lymph nodes are identified, the largest is 16mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - each one lymph node; 3 - ?lymph nodes as seen.
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node"consists of a lymph node and attached fatty tissue 45 x 30 x 8mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified 15 and 16mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - each one lymph node.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal wall" consists of an unorientated elliptical skin excision 110 x 15mm with subcutaneous fatty tissue, 130x 35 x 20mm.  No lesions are identified.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representatives.   (ST/ta 18/6/65) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr R Rorie):
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.  The tumour is situated on the right side extending from the 6 o'clock position posteriorly to 1 o'clock position anteriorly.  Lymphovascular invasion is seen however, no perineural invasion is identified.  The tumour measures 25mm along the cervical canal.  Tumour invades to a maximum depth of 12mm through a wall thickness of 18mm.  The ectocervical margin is 4mm clear.  The circumferential margin is free of tumour and no tumour is seen within pericervical adipose tissue.  The endometrium is proliferativeand the fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  The three (3) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
C.  The four (4) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One (1) of the fourteen (14) lymph nodes contains metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  The deposit measures 2mm across with no extranodal spread.  
E. The four (4) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  The four (4) lymph nodes identified show nosignificant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Sections show skin with subcutis.  There is no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - H.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubesand lymph nodes:
- Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.
- Length of 25mm along the cervical canal.
- Maximum depth of invasion 12mm through wall thickness of 18mm.
- Margins clear 
- Single right obturator lymph node positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
