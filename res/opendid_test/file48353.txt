Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Stage IVa peritoneal cancer.  Diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma from ascitic fluid cytology.  Neoadjuvant chemo x 3 cycles.  For interval debulking today.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix B/L tubes plus ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 71g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 30 x 30mm and has a variably pale smooth and roughened serosal surface.   The ectocervix measures 20 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 37mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm, and the right ovary measures 25 x 13 x 17mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 36mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm.  It has paratubal cysts.  The left ovary measures 27 x 13 x 14mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  There are fatty deposits below both ovaries, on the right side measuring 16 x 11 x 7mm, and on the left side measuring 15 x 19 x 16mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness, and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  The anterior myometrium has a 5mm intramural fibroid towards the serosal surface.  The posterior myometrium contains two fibroids ranging in size up to 8mm in diameter.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 - RS anterior fibroid; 5 to 7 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 8 - LS right fimbriae; 9 - two TS right fallopian tube; 10 to 11 - three TS right ovary; 12 - RS right parametrial fat; 13 - LS left fimbriae; 14 - four TS left fallopian tube; 15 to 16 - three TS left ovary; 17 - RS left parametrial fat.  Please refer to blocking diagram.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Gastro - colic ligament&amp;quot;, consists of two pieces of fat, the first measures 35 x 15 x 15mm, the second measures 40 x 40 x 35mm.  Both pieces contain a single suture.  No discrete nodule is identified, however there are pale firm bands through the fatty tissue.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - smaller piece serially sectioned; 3 to 6 - RS from larger piece.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Transverse mesocolon nodule&amp;quot;, consists of a tan piece of tissue 4 x 2 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Small bowel nodule&amp;quot;, consists of two pale and tan pieces of tissue, the first measures 11 x 1 x 1mm, the second measures 12 x up to 5 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Neidhardt):
A.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving the surface of both ovaries, the paradnexal soft tissues, and the uterine serosa.  There is no carcinoma is situ of the tubal epithelium.
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium shows small leiomyomas.
B.  The omentum shows extensive high grade serous carcinoma.  The Chemotherapy Response Score is 2 (of 3).
C.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections show adhesions.  No definite carcinoma is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin, extensively involving the omentum, also involving the surface of both ovaries, the paradnexal soft tissues, the uterine serosa and the transverse colon.
