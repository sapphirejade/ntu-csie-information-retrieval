HISTORY:  
Peritonectomy. CRC.
- Omentum, small bowel, sigmoid, gallbladder, peritoneal disease.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, SIGMOID, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, GALLBLADDER AND PERITONEAL DISEASE". Consists of segment of small bowel,gallbladder, uterus without cervix. Multiple pieces of peritoneum and omentum. There is a segment of large bowel discovered,-----with uterus. The gallbladder measures 70x30x30mm. The serosa of the gallbladder is smooth and shiny. Gallbladder opened, contains bile and one gallstone, measuring 20mm in diameter. The mucosa is velvety. Representative sections are taken and embedded. 
(1 proximal surgical margin; 2 transverse section of the body; 3 longitudinal section of the fundus).
There is segment of small bowel, measuring 340mm in length with circumference up to 35mm. There are no obvious lesions identified within the lumen of the bowel on the serosal surface. The serosal surface appears uneven. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(4 margin one; 5 margin two; 6,7&8 representative sections of the bowel with uneven areas of serosa).
The uterus appears to be fused with segment ofsigmoid colon. The uterus without cervix, measures 70x50x50mm. There is serosal fibroid within the anterior fundus of the uterus, measuring 20mm in diameter. The uterus with fused structures, measures 410g. The fallopian tubes and ovaries appear fused, together and cannot be possibly measured. The measurement could be approximate. The segment of colon attached to the uterus measures 100mm in length. It appears very disrupted. It appears there is large tumour fuses allof them together. This tumour measures about 45x45x50mm. The endometrium appears up to 1mm in thickness. The myometrium is up to 23mm in thickness. The serosal surface of the fundus of the uterus appears flat and uneven. There is no fimbrial end, cannot be identified of the right fallopian tube. The right ovary appears to measures 30x15x20mm. On the sectioning, on the right ovary no obvious lesions identified. The left fallopian tube cannot be found. There is cystic lesion with necrotic centre identified at the left side of the uterus. It measures 55x40x40mm. This lesion is probably left ovary. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(9 sigmoid bowel attached to the tumour; 10&11 representative sections of the endometrium with myometrium; 12 section of the fundus of the uterus with uneven serosa; 13 uterus attached to the tumour; 14 section of the right fallopian tube; 15&16 section of the right ovary; 17&18 sectionsof the sigmoid colon fused with possible ?right sort of left ovary; 19 representative section of the wall of the cystic structure which possibly is representative left ovary).
There is omentum, measuring 190x70x70mm. There are no obvious lesions found within the omentum. On the sectioning, there is tumour with vague margin identified within the omentum. It measures about 20x20x15mm. Representative sections are taken and embedded in two blocks.
(20&21 representative sections of the omentum). 
The pieces of mesentery measures in aggregate 150x150x80mm. The piece of omentum is sectioned transversely. Representative sections are taken and embedded in four blocks. 
(22-25 representative sections of the mesentery). RS (M-25/ RO/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Y Lazzari)
Sections of gallbladder show changes of mild chronic cholecystitis. Part of the surface epithelium is denuded.
Sections from the small bowel segment show serosal acute inflammation and congestion. 
Sections of the sigmoid colon show infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the muscle wall extending to both right and left ovarian tissue. Theuterus shows multiple foci of adenomyosis and endometriosis. Multiple leiomyomas are identified within the myometrium.   
Sections of omental fat also show multiple deposits of tumour. There is focal lymphatic permeation. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, SIGMOID, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, GALLBLADDER AND PERITONEAL DISEASE
- METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING OMENTUM, COLON, PERITONEUM AND BOTH OVARIES.
