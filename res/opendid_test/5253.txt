HISTORY:
Small bowel cancer. Peritonectomy, rectum, omentum, small bowel cancer. Hilum lymph node. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "SMALL BOWEL, OMENTUM, RECTUM". Received multiple tissue fragments in one jar including:
A segment of small bowel 240mm in length and up to 30mm in diameter including a previous anastomosis site and multiple adhesions involving the small bowel loops associated with multiple white nodules (up to 10) measuring 2-3mm each present on the serosal surface and the attached mesentery. There is a prominent nodule measuring 20 mm within the mesocolon that has hard white surface. Attached to the same fragment a length of small bowel (40x35mm) with unremarkable outer surface. The mucosal surface reveals a polypoid area measuring 20mm in maximum diameter adjacent to the area of anastomosis with the  cut surface  reveals multiple metallic staples. No other mucosal lesions or polyps are identified. 
(1 resection margin adjacent to the  anastomosis; 2 resection margin away from anastomosis; 3 two LS across the attached small segment of small bowel; 4 two TS polypoid area near area of anastomosis; 5 largest nodule (20mm); 6 RS smaller peritoneal nodule; 7 three lymph nodes).
A segment of small bowel measuring 110mm in length and up to 35mm in diameter with mesentery along its length to a maximum width of 25mm. Multiple adhesions are identified at the serosal surface with  no definite deposits identified. The  mucosal surface is unremarkable with no polyps or lesions. 
(8 LS of each resection margin; 9&10 each one TS lumen with overlying areas of adhesions).
A section of large bowel including rectum with sigmoid and the whole specimen above the anterior peritoneal reflection measuring 230mm in length and up to 25mm in diameter with mesocolon along its length to a maximum width of 110mm. The  serosal surface including the anterior peritoneal reflection includes multiple minute nodules 3-5 mm (up to ten nodules). Multiple areas of adhesions are identified along the length of the bowel with no definite other nodules identified. The mucosal surface is revelas multiple (20-30) uncomplicated diverticula with no polyps or discrete lesions identified. 
(11 TS proximal margin; 12 LS distal margin; 13 TS bowel with possible overlying 5mm nodules; 14 TS bowel with overlying adhesions showing an uncomplicated diverticulum; 15 RS of peritoneal nodules).
An unorientated fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 350x240x60mm. Serially slicing reveals at least three firm white nodular areas measuring 15-20mm in maximum diameter. The remainder cut surface is fatty and  unremarkable. 
(16-18 each one TS of the firm nodules; 19 RS normal omentum).
Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring 150x110x30mm in aggregate, one of which appears to have a possible peritoneum with adjacent firm brown cut surface. Multiple (up to five) firm white nodules are identified on the glistening peritoneal surface). 
(20 firm dark brown area {?muscle}]; 21 ?nodules on the adjacent peritoneum; 22 larger peritoneal nodules). RS (M-22/TP/ht).
B. "HILAR LYMPH NODE". Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring 80x60x20mm in aggregate. Eight possible lymph nodes are identified, largest measuring 32x20x15mm. The cut surface is dark brown with pale and tan peripheral areas. 
(1 one lymph node trisected; 2 one lymph node trisected; 3 three lymph nodes; 4 one lymph node bisected; 5 one lymph node bisected; 6-8 each two TS largest lymph node). RS (M-8).
 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr E Woodhead)
A.Sections show metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from gastrointestinal tract primary, involving serosa and mesentery of anastomosed small bowel and  mesentery, serosa and muscularis propria of rectosigmoid, omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is also seen in one lymph node examined from the  mesentery of the  anastomosed smallbowel. 
Sections through the separately segment of small bowel show serosal adhesions without involvement by tumour. 
The rectosigmoid also shows a complicated diverticular disease. No mucosal lesions are seen in any of the bowel segments.
B.  Eight lymph nodes examined show reactive changes including lipogranulomas. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:   
SMALL BOWEL, OMENTUM, RECTUM:  
 - METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING SEROSA AND MESENTERY OF SMALL BOWEL, OMENTUM, PERITONEUM AND SEROSA AND MUSCULARIS OF RECTOSIGMOID. 
HILAR LYMPH NODES:  
 - NO TUMOUR SEEN IN EIGHT LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.
