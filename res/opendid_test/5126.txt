CLINICAL:
79 year old woman with recurrent vulval melanoma.  Previously excised 2064, nil further treatment.  Sentinel node biopsy previously negative 2064.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled"Right hemivulva", consists of an excision of vulva, measuring 35 x 35 x 16mm.  At one end there is a suture denoting 12 o'clock.  Centrally there is abrownish nodule, 16 x 13mm.  The 12 o'clock half is inked blue; 6 o'clock half is inked black. The nodule is 4mm from the 
6 o'clock skin margin, 14mm from the 12 o'clock margin, 13 mm from the 9 o'clock margin and 12mm from the 3 o'clock margin.  The nodule is 11mm in maximum thickness and it is 15mm from the deep margin (block 15).  The specimen is serially sectioned from 3-9 o'clock in 20 blocks (block 1- 3 o'clock shave margin, 19 & 20 - 9 o'clock shave margin- 19 skin; 20 deep fatty tissue), 2-17 - TS across the lesion, 12 o'clock half first followed by the 6 o'clock half, 18 - 1TS).  AE.   (TO:  Cristobal/ec 22.10.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Luga):
The specimen has been blocked and assessed in its entirety. 
Sections of the vulva show malignant melanomawith a well-circumscribed nodular growth pattern.  It is composed of sheets and compact nests of focally pigmented epithelioid cells.  The tumour cells demonstrate moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, high grade nuclear atypia, irregular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.  Dermal mitotic activity rate is up to 5/mm2. The tumour invades to the subcutaneous fat consistent with Clark level 5.  The Breslow thickness is 9.8mm inthe deepest point of invasion.  There is no associated ulceration or tumour regression.  Mild proliferation of the junctional melanocytes is appreciable, but no evidence of melanoma in-situ component is identified.  Lymphovascular space invasion can be focally seen.  Neurotropism appears absent.  
The closest deep surgical margin is clear by 1.3mm corresponding to a focal defect.
The 6 and 12 o'clock margins are 6 and 14mm clear respectively.  
The adjacent skin shows epidermal atrophy, focal depletion of rete pegs, and mild dermal fibrosis. assessment reveals expression of HMB45 and Sox10 markers by the tumour cells.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right hemivulva:
	Malignant melanoma, Breslow thickness of 9.8mm.
	Invasion to the subcutaneous fat (Clark level 5).
	Mitotic count up to 5/mm2.
	LVSI present.
	Deep surgical margin clear by 1.3mm.
	Peripheral margins free of tumour.
