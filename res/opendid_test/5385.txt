MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Treger): 
Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  No normal endometrium is seen.  The tumour is a malignant mixed mullerian tumour (carcinosarcoma).  The epithelial component has features most consistent with a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The sarcoma component consists of pleomorphic spindle cells.  No heterologous elements are identified.  The tumour is roughly 50% carcinoma and 50% sarcoma in this sample.
