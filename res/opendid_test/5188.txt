CLINICAL:
No clinical details provided.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Lower oesophageal bx" consists ofa 3mm biopsy.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Gastric body bx" consists of a 3mm biopsy.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Gastric antrum bx" consists of two biopsies, 3 and 4mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel bx" consists of two biopsies, 3 and 4mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.  (IV/mm 4.10.61) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Stayter):   
A. The fragment of oesophageal squamous epithelium shows elongation of the stromal papillae, which almost reach the top of the epithelium.  Basal cell hyperplasia is present.  No intraepithelial eosinophils are found.  No yeast or fungi are demonstrated bythe PAS stain. There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia.
B. The biopsy of gastric acid secreting mucosa shows mild chronic inflammation mainly involving superficial mucosa.  No helicobacter-like organisms are demonstrated by the giemsa stain. There is no evidence of malignancy, intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia.
C. The biopsy of gastric antral type mucosa shows moderate chronic inflammation. No helicobacter-like organisms are demonstrated by the giemsa stain. There is no evidence of malignancy, intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia.
D.  The fragments of small intestinal mucosa show preservation of the villous architecture.  There is no significant acute inflammation. No parasites or granulomas are identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia.
conclusion
A. Oesophageal biopsy: Mild reactive changes.
B,C. Gastric body and antrum biopsies: Chronicinflammation.
D. Small bowel biopsy: No significant abnormality.
