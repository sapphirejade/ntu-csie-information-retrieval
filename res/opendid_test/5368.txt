HISTORY:  
Ovarian mass CA125-3349. L ovary and tube, for frozen section. 
Right ovary and tube, right pelvic peritoneum, uterus and pouch of Douglas peritoneum, left pelvic lymph nodes, omentum, appendix. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "LEFT OVARY, TUBE". Smooth surface lobulated cyst ovarian mass 120x80x80mm.Cut surface is haemorrhagic contents with solid pale tumour nodules measuring up to 15x25mm. Capsule is intact. 
F/S: "High grade carcinoma, ?serous, ?endometrioid". Reported by Dr Q Bethell via phone to Dr Marion on 27.04.2066 at 3.42pm. 
Post fixation assessment reveals a fallopian tube measuring 50mm and up to 15mm in diameter. The ovary is nodular with multiple solid and cystic spaces that are lined by haemorrhagic tissue as well as smooth innerlining. Multiple papillary fronds are identified within the solid areas. There are cystic areas filled with yellow serous fluid. The cut surface of the fallopian tube reveals a thickened wall up to 4mm with unremarkable lumen. 
(1 frozen; 2 fimbrial end trisected; 3 three TS tube; 4-9 haemorrhagic cystic areas; 10-13 papillary like areas; 14 tumour block for tissue banking). RS (M-14).
B. "RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE". A fallopian tube with fimbrial end measuring 55x10mm with attached cystic ovarian structure measuring 90x75x30mm. The outer surface is nodular, partly smooth but partly firm white in colour (a nodule on the serosal surface measuring 60mm in maximum diameter). Thecut surface reveals multiple cystic structures, mostly filled with clear serous fluid with adjacent solid and papillary areas. The largest cystic structure measures 45mm in maximum diameter and the largest solid tan area measures 30mm in maximum diameter. The solid nodule on the serosal surface has a firm tan homogenous cut surface. A haemorrhagic corpus luteum is noted.
(1 fimbrial end trisected; 2 three TS tube; 3&4 serosal nodule; 5 serosal nodule with adjacent solid areas; 6&7 ?haemorrhagic corpus lutea; 8-11 representative solid papillary areas). RS (M-11).
C. "RIGHT PELVIC PERITONEUM". A fibrofatty piece of tissue including a piece of glistening surface peritoneum measuring 20x20x5mm with overlying tan nodule measuring 20x15x10mm. The cut surface reveals invasion of the firm hard nodule into the underlying tissueof peritoneum. 
(1&2 each one TS). RS (2-2).
D. "UTERUS AND POUCH OF DOUGLAS PERITONEUM". A total hysterectomy specimen of a total weight of 203g measuring 100x75x60mm. A piece of peritoneum is attached posteriorly (peritoneum of Pouch of Douglas), measuring 100x40x15mm, which appears to be extensively involved by multiple tan and white tumour nodules, all have firm cut surface. The attached cervix measures 40x35x30mm. The external os isslit like, 30x3mm. The anterior cervix is inked black and posterior blue. The serosal surface other than the peritoneum is unremarkable. The endometrium is up to 2mm thick. The myometrium is trabeculated and up to 30mm thick with  multiple intramural fibroids, largest measuring 25mm at the posterior body area.
(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 anterior isthmus; 4 posterior isthmus; 5 anterior body; 6&7 posterior body with largest fibroid; 8-10 fundus [8anterior; 9 mid; 10 posterior]; 11 RS of smaller fibroids; 12&13 RS of peritoneal nodules). RS (M-13).
E. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES". A fibrofatty piece of tissue 20x10x5mm bearing two possible lymph nodes 4mm and 8mm.RS (2-1).
F. "OMENTUM".  A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 220x100x20mm. The outer surface is smooth and glistening. The specimen is serially sliced, one loosely attached brown nodule (6mm)with tan cut surface is identified. No other nodules identified. 
(1 RS omentum with attached nodule bisected; 2-3 RS remainder omentum). RS (M-4).
G. "APPENDIX". An appendix 70x6mm with a smooth tan outer lining. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The lumen is filled with faecal like material. 
(1 base [two LS and one TS]; 2 two TS mid; 3 tip [two LS and one TS]). RS (8-3/BX/ht).
