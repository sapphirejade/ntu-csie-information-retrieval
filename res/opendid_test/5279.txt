Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
HG serous ovarian Ca, IBD post 3 cycles chemo.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 28g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 35 x 30mm and has a smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.  No myometrial lesions are seen.  Blocks: 1 to 3- full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right infundibular pelvic ligament", consists of a piece of tan tissue, 35 x 15 x 10mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  AE 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall peritoneum", consists of a piece of tan tissue, 30 x 12 x 7mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  AE 1 block.   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right round ligament", consists of a piece of tan tissue, 35 x 7 x3mm.  AE 1 block.   
E.  Specimen labelled "Left infundibular pelvic ligament ", consists of a piece of tan and focally haemorrhagic tissue, 60 x 30 x 5mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  AE 4 blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled "Transverse colon appendices epiploic", consists of two pieces of adipose tissue, 25 x 15 x 8 and 20 x 15 x 4mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  AE 2 blocks.
G. Specimen labelled "Umbilical hernia sac and contents", consists of three pieces of tan tissue, 40 x 30 x 8mm in aggregate.  No focal lesions are seen.  AE 3 blocks.
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of omental tissue, 270 x 170 x 10mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  RS 3 blocks.   (TO: DC;PL/vo 12.4.66) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Molinaro):
A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium and serosa show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The right infundibular pelvic ligament shows changes consistent with treatment effect.  There is fibrosis and scarring, granulation tissue with chronic inflammation, and hyalinised vascular walls.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The left pelvic side wall peritoneum shows scant clusters of residual carcinoma.  The carcinoma cells have pleomorphic nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm.  There are also changes consistent with treatment effect.
D.  The right round ligament shows changes consistent with treatment effect.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  The left infundibular pelvic ligament shows changes consistent with treatment effect.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  The transverse colon appendices epiploica shows inflammatory adhesions, consistent with treatment effect.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  The umbilical hernia sac and contents show changes consistent with treatment effect.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
H.  The sections of omentum show patchy peritoneal inflammation consistent with treatment effect, as well as a single calcification.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative sections seen with Dr I Herzing.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to H.  Uterus and cervix, right and left infundibular pelvic ligaments, left pelvic side wall peritoneum, right round ligament, transverse colon appendices epiploica, umbilical hernia sac andcontents, and omentum:
-  Scant residual carcinoma in left pelvic side wall peritoneum.
-  Remainder of specimens show treatment effect only.
