CLINICAL:
Caecal Ca.  Lap Rt hemi.  No mets.  No perforation.


MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right hemicolectomy&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of large bowel, (130mm in length; 55mm circumference), terminal ileum (60mm length; 33mm circumference), and pericolic fibroadipose tissue (up to 70mm in width).  An appendix is not identified.  The caecal lumen is expanded by a solid/papilliform tumour, 47 x 50 x 25mm.  The tumour is at least 60mm from the proximal margin and 80mm from the distal margin.  The remaining bowel mucosa shows no significant abnormality.  The stapled bowel margins are inked blue.  On sectioning, the tumour extends to a depth of 19mm, and may focally involve muscularis propria.  Blocks: 1 - LS proximal margin; 2 - LS distal margin; 3 to 5 - deepest tumour invasion; 6 - central tumour; 7 - apical margin, apical lymph node as seen; 8 - remaining apical lymph node; 9 - single lymph node, trisected; 10 - single lymph node; 11 - single lymph node, bisected; 12 &amp;amp; 13 - single lymph node, sectioned (?involved); 14 to 21 - fibroadipose tissue, lymph nodes as seen.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Florencio):
Sections show a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma arising and associated from tubulovillous adenoma with moderate dysplasia.  The tumour has the following features:

BOWEL CANCER PROFORMA

Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour: Caecum
Maximum tumour diameter: 50mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 60mm
Tumour perforation:  No

Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS.

The tumour is composed of predominantly complex cribriform glands, many of which garland necrosis, as well as a few smaller tubular glands.


Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
T2	Invasion into muscularis propria (eg block 4)

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin: Well clear

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  12
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1

N1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN

Lymphovascular invasion
Not seen

Perineural invasion
Not seen

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
Adenomas Tubulovillous adenoma with moderate (low grade) ________

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Immunohistochemistry:
Mismatch Repair Deficiency Protein Expression (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

Stage (AJCC 8th Ed 2017):
Stage pT2 N1 MX R0



DIAGNOSIS:
Right hemicolectomy:
-  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in caecum, invades muscularis propria, no lymphovascular invasion seen, no perineural invasion seen, margins clear, one of twelve mesocolic lymph nodes containing metastatic adenocarcinoma (1/12), preserved mismatch repair enzyme immunoexpression, stage pT2 N1 MX R0 (AJCC 8th Ed 2017).
