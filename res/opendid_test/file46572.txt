Pelvic washings, endometrial cancer grade 1.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Cervix, uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes plus ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 496g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 145 x 80mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The uterus has multiple serosal and intramural fibroids ranging in size from 3 to 53mm.  One fibroid in the anterior left uterus has a focus of haemorrhage/necrosis measuring 5mm. The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of 4mm.  The left ovary measures 34 x 12 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The right ovary measures 34 x 9 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. On the serosal surface of the right and left fallopian tubes there are multiple pale to tan smooth papules ranging from 2 to 3mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 74mm in maximum thickness.  There is no obvious endometrial tumour.
Blocks: 1 to 10 - partial LS of anterior body and cervix, excluding most anterior aspect with fibroids; 12 &amp;amp; 13 - left endomyometrium; 14 to 16 - fibroid with necrotic/haemorrhagic area; 17 - right anterior endomyometrium; 18 to 25 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 26 &amp;amp; 27 - right posterior endomyometrium and cervix; 28 to 30 - left posterior endomyometrium with cervix; 31 - LS left fimbriae; 32 - three TS left ovary; 33 - three TS left fallopian tube; 34 - LS right fimbriae; 35 - three TS right ovary; 36 - three TS right fallopian tube.  Please refer to blocking diagram.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right external iliac sentinel lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of an irregular fatty piece of tissue 17 x 17 x 11mm.  Blocks: 1 - one blue dyed lymph node in six pieces; 2 - one possible lymph node.  AE.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left external iliac sentinel lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fat 23 x 11 x 9mm.  Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node serially embedded in seven pieces.  (TO:RS/rs 19/8/70)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Vajda):
A.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  There is no convincing myometrial invasion.  There is no lymphvascular invasion.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The myometrium contains numerous leiomyomas.  The left ovary has a focus of endometriosis.  The right ovary and both tubes are unremarkable.
B.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
C.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.   No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.  Two negative lymph nodes.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 16/8/70:

As requested, Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed. MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
