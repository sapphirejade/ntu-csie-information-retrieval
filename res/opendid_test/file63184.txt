CLINICAL NOTES:
Stage 1B Ca cervix.
1. Uterus tubes and ovaries
2. Right parametrial node
3. Right uterine artery
4. Left uterine artery
5. Right pelvic lymph node
6. Left pelvic lymph node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, BILATERAL&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, weighing 147g. Uterus measures 90x40x40mm. Ectocervix measures 40x25mm. There is a tan lobulated lesion present over the ectocervix. Cervix is amputated and serially sliced from right to left. Sectioning shows ill-defined lobulated creamy lesion measuring approximately 25mm with a maximum depth of 15mm. It is approximately from posterior cervical surface and about 8mm from anterior. Endometrium measures within 1mm. Possible extension to the lower segment is present. Anterior wall measures 13mm, posterior wall is 20mm.
Right ovary measures 90mm in length, 10mm in diameter. Paratubal cyst is present. Sectioning is unremarkable. Right ovary measures 30x18x10mm. Sectioning shows 5mm thick simple cyst with a smooth lining. It is otherwise unremarkable. Left tube measures 65mm in length, 7mm in diameter. Sectioning is unremarkable. Left ovary measures 30x15x10mm. There is a lobulated orange focus, possibly corpus luteumt.
(1 right cervical margin; 2 and 3 one full face of tumour cervix; 4 and 5 one full face of tumour cervix; 6 and 7 one full tumour of cervix; 8 LS from left side cervical margin; 9 and 10 one full face transverse section of lower segment; 11-15 one full face sagittal view of the uterus [11 anterior wall; 12 posterior wall]; 16 another section of lower segment to uterus; 17 right tube; 18 right ovary; 19 left tube; 20 left ovary). Representative sections (M-20)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT PARAMETRIAL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of a small lymph node 6mm. All embedded. (1-1)
C. &amp;quot;RIGHT UTERINE ARTERY&amp;quot;. Consists of tubular structure 17mm in length, 5mm in diameter. It is serially sliced and all embedded. All embedded. (M-1)
D. &amp;quot;LEFT UTERINE ARTERY&amp;quot;. Consists of two irregular pieces of tissue, possibly tubular structure in the middle 20mm each. All are sliced and embedded. All embedded. (M-1)
E. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of fibrofatty tissue 50x30x10mm.
(1 one lymph node bisected; 2 ? lymph node; 3 and 4 ? lymph node). Representative sections (M-3)
F. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Multiple fibrofatty tissues measuring 40x30mm containing three lymph nodes: two lymph nodes 20mm each and one lymph node 10mm.
(1 one lymph node sliced; 2 one lymph node sliced; 3 one lymph node bisected). Representative sections (M-3/SM 14/1/2070 cy)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. Z. Heimlich)
A.

UTERINE CERVIX: Resection

PROCEDURE: Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

TUMOUR SIZE: Estimated 32mm greatest dimension (extending throughout the endocervical canal to the junction with lower uterine segment).

TUMOUR SITE: Left inferior (posterior) quadrant and right inferior (posterior) quadrant. Adenocarcinoma in-situ and superficially invasive adenocarcinoma also involve the anterior right and left quadrants.

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Predominantly well differentiated villoglandular adenocarcinoma, but with a component of endocervical adenocarcinoma of usual type, predominantly at the advancing edge and the deep invasive aspect of the tumour.

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Predominantly well differentiated.

DEPTH OF STROMAL INVASION: At least 13mm (difficult to accurately determine due to the exophytic and endophytic nature of the tumour growth).

DEPTH OF STROMAL INVASION (MIDDLE ONE-THIRD): Through a 21mm wall at this point. (invades13mm through 21mm wall).

HORIZONTAL EXTENT OF STROMAL INVASION:estimated 32mm.

OTHER TISSUE OR ORGAN INVOLVEMENT: None identified.

MARGINS:
Radial circumferential margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Distance of invasive carcinoma from margin: Approximately 8mm.
Location: Within the cervix.

VAGINAL CUFF MARGIN: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.

DISTANCE OF INVASIVE CARCINOMA FROM MARGIN: Estimated at least 10mm.

LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Present adjacent to the deep invasive margin.

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: All lymph nodes negative for tumour cells.
TOTAL NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: 7

SITES: Right parametrial lymph node (1), right and left pelvic lymph nodes (3 each).

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The endometrium appears inactive. The myometrium and serosal surface is unremarkable. The right and left fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The right ovary shows several small follicular cysts and the left ovary contains a corpus luteum cyst.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE CLASSIFICATION (PTNM AJCC 8th EDITION): pT1b

B. The single lymph node shows mild reactive changes only.

C. Sections show an artery with no evidence of malignancy.

D. Sections show an artery with no evidence of malignancy.

E. The three lymph nodes show reactive changes only.

F. The three lymph nodes show reactive changes only (no immunohistochemistry performed).

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, BILATERAL:
- INVASIVE ENDOCERVICAL ADENOCARCINOMA, PREDOMINANTLY WELL DIFFERENTIATED VILLOGLANDULAR, BUT WITH A COMPONENT OF MORE TYPICAL ENDOCERVICAL ADENOCARCINOMA IN THE DEEPER AREA OF THE TUMOUR, pT1B.
B. RIGHT PARAMETRIAL NODE:
- THE SINGLE LYMPH NODE SHOWS REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
C. RIGHT UTERINE ARTERY:
- UNREMARKABLE ARTERY.
D. LEFT UTERINE ARTERY:
- UNREMARKABLE ARTERY.
E. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE:
-THE THREE LYMPH NODES SHOW REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
F. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE:
-THE THREE LYMPH NODES SHOW REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
