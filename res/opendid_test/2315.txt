Sacral chordoma excision (en bloc excision of sacrum S3-5).  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Sacral tumour with marking stitches; short at 12 o'clock, medium at 3 o'clock, long at 9 o'clock", consists of an oriented en bloc excision of sacrum from S3 to S5 and coccyx, with surrounding soft tissue and overlying ellipse of skin.  The majority of the deep marginconsists of intact presacral fascia.  The specimen is 170mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 130mm (3 to 9 o'clock) x 90mm (superficial to deep).  Over the superficial surface, midway from 12 to 6 o'clock, is a transverse skin ellipse, 125 x 25mm, with a partial incision 90mm in length.  The superficial margin is inked blue, deep black, 3 o'clock green and 9 o'clock red/green.  The S3 sacral body is detached and the false margin created is inked yellow.   
There is a circumscribed tumour centred within the deep soft tissue/bone of the 12 o'clock half of the specimen.  The tumour is 90mm (12 to 6 o'clock) x 70mm (3 to 9 o'clock) x 75mm (superficial to deep).  The tumour has a pale grey fleshy cut surface.  The tumour involves both the pre- and post sacral soft tissue, and extends to the subcutaneous fascia.  The tumour invades into the S3 vertebral body, and is 12mm clear of the 12 o'clock sacral margin.  Towards the 6 o'clock end of the specimen, in the post sacral soft tissue there appears to be a separate tumour nodule, 15 x 15 x 15mm. This nodule appears to lie 7mm from the main tumour mass.  
Blocks 1 & 2 - deep 9 o'clock margin with tumour (1 - reserve block); 3 - superficial 9 o'clock margin near tumour; 4 & 5 - deep 12 o'clock margin at 9 o'clock end with tumour; 6 - superficial 12 o'clock margin in midline; 7 - deep 12 o'clock margin immediately adjacent to sacrum at 3 o'clock end; 8 - superficial/12 o'clock margin near midline; 9 - superficial 12 o'clock margin at 3 o'clock end; 10 & 11 - deep 12 o'clock margin at 3 o'clock end with closest tumour; 12 - deep 3 o'clock margin with tumour; 13 - deep 3 o'clock margin; 14 - superficial 3 o'clock margin; 15 - 3 o'clock margin near skin ellipse; 16 - 3 o'clock margin towards 6 o'clock end; 17 - 9 o'clock margin towards 6 o'clock end; 18 - 9 o'clock margin at level of skin ellipse; 19 - skin with incision; 20 & 21 - superficial margin with tumour, 12 o'clock end of specimen; 22 - superficial margin at 6 o'clock edge of skin ellipse; 23 & 24 - presacral deep margin with tumour; 25 - second tumour nodule at 6 o'clock end of specimen; 26 - skin and tumour.  Further sections to follow after decalcification.  Specimen photographstaken.  Please see block diagram.  (TO: KE/ec 22.6.65) 
Blocks 27- soft tissue 6 o'clock margin; 28 and 29 - superficial aspect of 12 o'clock margin, 9 o'clock end; 30 - deep aspect of 12 o'clock margin, 9 o'clock end; 31 to 33 - centre of tumour.  (TO: CP;UB/vo 24.6.65) 
Blocks 34 to 39 - LS 12 o'clock margin of sacral body (34 - 9 o'clock end; 35 and 36 - midline; 37 and 38 - 3 o'clock half with tumour; 39 - 3 o'clock end); 40 - tumour at 3 o'clock with bone; 41 - tumour at 9 o'clock with bone.  (FG 26.6.65)
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr J Warnock & Dr J Raczynski)
This case was handed over by Dr Earnest on 29.6.2065.
The sections show a 90mm conventional chordoma involving the sacrum and pre and post sacral soft tissue. The tumour shows typical morphology including a predominantly multi-lobulated architecture, with coalescing tumour lobules consisting of epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and surrounding myxoid stroma. Physaliphorous cells are seen. The nuclei are hyperchromatic with mild to moderate pleomorphism as well as scattered nuclear pseudo-inclusions.  Rare but atypical mitoses are identified (1 per 10 HPF).  The tumour contains areas of necrosis, comprising <10% of the tumour.  No dedifferentiation is identified.  Multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen (3, 9, 10). Sections through the separate 15mm nodule confirm the presence of separate foci of chordoma (8.0mm to closest margin (25)). 
Sections through the sacrum post decalcification show infiltration of bony trabeculae and sacral soft tissues by tumour.  No cutaneous involvement is seen. No convincing perineural invasion is identified.  
Margins of excision:
The tumour shows extensive infiltration of the included sacral bone, pre-sacral and post-sacral soft tissues. The margins of excision are as follows:
	12 o'clock margin: Tumour involves the 12 o'clock margin over a 4mm front, on the 9 o'clock side of the sacrum (5, 30).  
	3 o'clock margin: Tumour is 0.2mm from the 9 o'clock margin (superficial aspect) (9).
	6 o'clock margin: Tumour is 8.0mm to closest margin (18, 22). 
	9 o'clock margin: Tumour is 0.3mm from the 9 o'clock margin (deep aspect) (2).
	Superficial (soft tissue): Tumour is 8.0mm from the soft tissue margin (21).
	Superficial (cutaneous): Tumour is 5.5mm from the cutaneous margin (26). 
	Deep margin (bony pre-sacral): Tumour involves the deep margin focally (35).
	Deep margin (soft tissue pre-sacral): Tumour is 0.25mm form the deep soft tissue margin (0.25mm) 
	Sacral bony margin (9 o'clock end): Tumour present.
	Sacral bony margin (3 o'clock end): Tumour present. 

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
The tumour shows positive staining for CAM5.2 (strong), EMA (strong) and S100 (patchy weak). The tumour is negative for c-kit (CD117).
COMMENT:
The sacral tumour is a conventional chordoma. The tumour shows similar morphology and immunohistochemical staining to the previously reported core biopsy (38I80908).
DIAGNOSIS:
Sacral tumour, en bloc excision of sacrum S3 to S5:
Conventional chordoma, 90mm, with separate 15mm nodule.
Chordoma is present focally at margins (see text).
Lymphovascular invasion.
