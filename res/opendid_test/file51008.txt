3. Appendiceal epiploica.
4. Right pelvic node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. A total hysterectomy specimen, 138g, consists of uterus, measuring 75x50x35mm. The cervix measures 40x25x20mm. Attached is a right fallopian tube, 65x6mm; grossly enlarged right ovary, 30x17x15mm; a left fallopian tube, 70x6mm; and left ovary, 25x15x14mm. Portions of the broad ligament and the pouch of douglas peritoneum is attached to the specimen, up to 30mm.

The serosal surfaces including the pouch of douglas, ovarian surface, the anterior and posterior peritoneal strips have numerous minute white nodules which are partially calcified and partially necrotic. The anterior cervical margin is inked blue, superior is inked black. The uterus is bi-valved sagittally . The endometrium is up to 3mm thick. The myometrium is up to 25mm. No polyps or tumours are identified. The left fallopian tube outer surface reveals multiple paratubal cysts with a clear serous fluid adjacent to multiple minute white deposits. The cut surface of the right ovary is unremarkable. The left fallopian tube has a paratubal cyst towards its fimbrial end, measuring 15mm in maximum diameter filled with clear serous fluid. The left ovary has unremarkable cut surface.

(1-3 LS, anterior uterus from cervix to fundus; 4-6 LS posterior uterus from cervix to fundus [4 including the pouch of douglas peritoneum]; 7 and 8 right fallopian tube, all embedded; 9-11 right ovary, all embedded; 12 and 13 left fallopian tube, all embedded; 14-16 left ovary, all embedded; 17 and 18 posterior peritoneal strips; 19 and 20 anterior peritoneal strips). RS (M-20)

B. &amp;quot;OMENTUM&amp;quot;. A fibrofatty piece of tissue, 230x60x30mm. It is consistent with omentum that is diffusely involved by firm, white deposits (omental cake), occupying more than 90% of the submitted sample.

(1-3 omental involvement; 4 omental involvement, also tumour block for tissue banking). RS (4-4)

C. &amp;quot;APPENDICEAL EPIPLOICA&amp;quot;. Four lobulated fatty pieces of tissue, 10-16mm in maximum diameter. Focal white discolourisations are identified on the outer surface and is focally infiltrating into the underlying fat. Each fragment is bisected. AE (8-2)

D. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC NODE&amp;quot;. A lymph node, 7x5x3mm, bisected. AE (2-1)

E. &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY&amp;quot;. One firm, white nodular piece of tissue, 6x5x3mm, bisected. AE (2-1)

F. &amp;quot;APPENDIX&amp;quot;. An appendix, 45x6mm, with mesoappendix up to 25mm. The serosal surface of the mesoappendix has multiple minute white nodules, 1-2mm in maximum diameter. Similar nodules are identified on the outer surface of the appendix. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The cut surface is unremarkable.

(1 base, one LS, one TS: 2 tip, one LS and one TS). RS (4-2/ZH 26/6/2067 cy)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr B Albarez)
A.  Sections show involvement of the anterior and posterior serosal surface of the uterus and lower uterine segment by high serous carcinoma.  There is also involvement of the right and left fallopian tube, right and left ovaries and attached anterior and posterior peritoneal strips by high grade serous carcinoma.

No squamous ectocervix is identified.  The glandular endocervix is unremarkable.  The endometrium is atrophic.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The uninvolved ovarian parenchyma shows no specific pathology.  The left fallopian tube shows several benign paratubal serous epithelial lined cysts, together with a walthard cyst.

B.  Sections show extensive involvement of the omentum by high grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma is characterised by typical immunoprofile (strong nuclear staining for p 53, WT1 and oestrogen receptor).  The stain for PAX-8 is weak and progesterone receptor is negative.  The involvement of the omentum shows minimal or no tumour response to chemotherapy (CRS score 1).

C.  Sections show serosal surface involvement of the fatty appendix epiploica by high grade serous carcinoma.

D.  Sections show one benign reactive lymph node.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

E.  Sections of the macroscopically described firm nodule show high grade serous carcinoma.

F.  Sections show scattered deposits of high grade serous carcinoma in the fatty subserosal tissue of the appendix.  There is fibrous obliteration of lumen of the appendix at the tip.  The lumen of the proximal appendix shows focal serrated change consistent with a sessile serrated adenoma.
