MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr B Cordy)
Representative sections show that the medial margin of this specimen is formed by florid reactive post surgical changes including suture granulomas. There is no evidence of in-situ or invasive malignancy.
There is a lobule showing changes of moderate to florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type without atypia and there are scattered foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia. Sections of the skin show an immature dermal scar including suture granulomas.

DIAGNOSIS:
RE-EXCISION MARGINS LEFT BREAST
- NO EVIDENCE OF IN-SITU OR INVASIVE MALIGNANCY.
