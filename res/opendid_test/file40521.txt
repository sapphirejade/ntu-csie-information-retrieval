MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  A piece of fatty tissue 20mm in maximum diameter with three nodes, 10mm blue node and two smaller nodes each measuring ?2mm in maximum diameter.  The larger lymph node is sampled for frozen. (1  frozen section blue node; 2  remainder of largest node paraffin; 3  two smaller nodes, not frozen).  RS (M-3).

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:   &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;.  to anaesthetist 4:15pm, by Dr S Legeyt.

(1  two LS slice 1 [superior]; 2  slice 2; 3  medial slice 3; 4  slice 4; 5  start of lesion slice 5; 6&amp;amp;7  end of lesion slice 6; 8  slice 7; 9  slice 8; 10  two LS slice 9 [inferior]).  RS (M-10).
Further blocks: 11 further sections from slice 1 superior end; LV

C.  &amp;quot;FURTHER LEFT BREAST LATERAL LESION&amp;quot;

DISSECTION: Cut from superior to inferior, 6 slices
FINDINGS / LESION:  The specimen has a fibrofatty cut surface, no discrete lesions.
(1  slice 1 superior; 2  slices 2 and 3; 3  slices 4 and 5; 4  slice 6 inferior).  AE (M-4/ZH km).

B.  LESION LEFT BREAST

BREAST INVASIVE CARCINOMA SYNOPTIC REPORT:

INVASIVE CARCINOMA:

MAXIMUM INVASIVE TUMOUR SIZE:  8 mm diameter (2 x 4 mm slices), 6 mm in cross section.

HISTOLOGIC TYPE:  Invasive carcinoma of no special type (ductal)

HISTOLOGIC GRADE:  Grade 2

SCORES: Tubules 3, Nuclei 2,  Mitoses 1;  Total Score: 6 of 9

MITOTIC RATE:  2 mitoses per 10 high power fields

WHOLE TUMOUR SIZE (INVASIVE + DCIS): equal to invasive carcinoma

PERITUMOURAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified

PERINEURAL INVASION: Not identified

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
- DCIS is present.
- Size (extent) of DCIS: DCIS is present only within invasive tumour.
- Nuclear grade: Intermediate grade
- Architecture/type: Solid
- Necrosis: Not identified
- Calcification of DCIS: Not identified
- Extensive intraductal component (EIC): Negative

LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS): Focal atypical lobular hyperplasia (lobular neoplasia) is present but not establised LCIS.

EXCISION MARGINS:
INVASIVE CARCINOMA MARGINS:
- Close (distance of invasive tumour to margins less than or equal to 1 mm)
- Distance of invasive carcinoma to margins:
Anterior: 0.5 mm (less than 1 mm), close margin, section 6. Invasive carcinoma extends to a relatively deep diathermy cleft the enters the anterior margin but this does not appear to be a true margin.
- Distance of invasive carcinoma to other margins: &amp;gt; 5 mm

DCIS MARGINS:
- Negative (not involved)
- Distance of DCIS to closest margins:
Anterior: 4 mm

HORMONE RECEPTORS, IMMUNOSTAINS:
Block B6: Other suitable tumour block for testing: Insuffient

ER:      POSITIVE, 90%, 3+
PR:      POSITIVE, 90%, 3+
HER2:  NEGATIVE (Score 0) Immunostain.
Ki-67:   variable up to 40 %

SEPARATE FINDINGS:
- Fibrocystic change, Epithelial hyperplasia, small radaial scars, larger ill defined complex sclerosing lesion, columnar cell change, duct dilatation, periductal sclerosis with focal calcification, small focus of sclerosing adenosis.
- There is a focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) in section 1 from near the superior end, clear of margins.

A. LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL NODE:
SENTINEL LYMPH NODES:
Not involved.
Nodes with macrometastases:  0
Nodes with micrometastases:  0
Nodes with isolated tumour cells:  0
Total number of nodes examined:  3

COMMENT(S): The carcinoma forms a solid lesion near the wire end.
