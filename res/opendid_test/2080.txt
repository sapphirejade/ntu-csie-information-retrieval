CLINICAL:
Large left ovarian mass discovered when staging for low grade lymphoma.(20 cigarettes per day), COPD.  Type 2 DM.  Asthma.  Hypertension.  Anxiety.  Low grade lymphoma.  Appendicectomy.  For flow cytology. 
69 year old female with adnexal mass for TAH, BSO. Also noted to have thickened endometrium on imaging.  ?possible granulosa cell tumour with invasion and uterine tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary", consists of a solid, smooth mass with a grey with surface measuring 130 x 95 x 80mm.  There is a solid cut surface with yellow gelatinous areas and pale pink/yellow cut surface which is slightly trabeculated.  A few cystic areas are identified in at the periphery.No fallopian tube is identified.  Two representative sections frozen section.  Flow cytometry sent as requested.  ED 4:50pm 08.03.65.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - frozen section; 3 to 10 - further representativesections.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign ?stomal tumour ?fibroma.
Phone results to Dr DEBRAH MANZI  by Dr D Probst at 5:03pm on 08.03.65
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus for frozen section", consists of a uteruswith attached cervix and a right ovary and fallopian tube weighing 48g in total.  The uterus was received partially opened and bivalved measuring 75 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and appears unremarkable.  Upon opening there is a 27 x 12 x 3mm polyp seen attached to the posterior wall.  One fibroid 10mm is identified which appears whorled and unremarkable.  One representative section taken of the polyp for frozen section.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 6mm.  The right ovary measures 23 x 22 x 14mm and the cut surface reveals firm nodular tissue which otherwise appears unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1- frozen section; 2 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 7 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 8 to 10 - remainder of polyp AE; 11 - representative right tube; 12 - representative right ovary 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Endometrial polyp.
Phone results to Dr D Remington by Dr D Sobrio at 6:01pm on 08.03.65.
(TO: OV;LC/vo 9.3.65) 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube" consists of fallopian tube measuring 32mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 6mm.  There is adnexal tissue attached measuring 40 x 20 x 15mm.
Blocks:  1 - fimbrial end of tube; 2 - TS of the centre withadnexal tissue; 3 - adnexal tissue.  (TO: IC; HG/rt 9.3.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. D Anthis):
A.  Sections show a fibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is essentially inactive and contains a large benign polyp.  The myometrium shows small leiomyomas.  The right ovary shows an early fibroma.  The right tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  Some atrophic ovarian tissue is attached.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A, B & C.  Large left ovarian fibroma.  Early small right ovarian fibroma.  Endometrial polyp.  No evidence of malignancy.
