HISTORY:  
Mesothelioma. Debulking.  Peritoneum, omentum.
Please Ki67.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"OMENTUM, PERITONEUM".  Received multiple tissue fragments including fibrofatty pieces of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 280x190x50mm in aggregate that appears to be extensively involved with diffuse firm nodular grey and haemorrhagic areas involving about 90% of the submitted identified omentum.  The cut surface confirms extensive areas of thickening onthe glistening (peritoneal surface) of the omentum.
Also received multiple fibrous pieces of tissue consistent with multiple fragments of peritoneum measuring 235x190x60mm that appears to be also involved by extensive thickening, nodularity with firm tan cut surface involving about 70% of the submitted peritoneum.  
(1-4 omentum; 5-8 peritoneum; 9 tumour tissue banking block). RS (M-9/NL/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Q Lensing)
Sections show fibroadipose tissue from peritoneum and omental origin. There is florid proliferation of epithelioid mesothelial cells forming solid clusters associated with chronic inflammation.  In many areas, there is extension of the abnormal mesothelial cells into the stroma and fat consistent with stromal invasion.  However, most of theproliferation appears to be on the surface and within the septae froming large solid clusters.
Comment :  Pathology shows florid atypical mesothelial proliferation consistent with well differentiated malignant mesothelioma of epithelioid cell type. 
Immunohistochemistry stains show positive staining for calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, CAM5.2 and WT1
Ki67 is positive in 20% of the tumour cells.
DIAGNOSIS:  
OMENTUM PERITONEUM -    WELL DIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA.
