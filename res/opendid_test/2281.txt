CLINICAL:
(L)inguinal lymph nodes.  Vulval SCC.  Vulval squamous cell carcinoma.  Lichen sclerosis.  Hypertension.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled"Left inguinal lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 60 x 45 x 30mm.  One lymph node is identified 30 x 15 x 15mm.  Transversely sectioned, one representative section for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section; 2to 7 - rest of the large lymph node; 8 - second lymph node identified in the fatty tissue bisected. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Radical anterior vulva, marked anteriorly" consists of a triangular shaped skin excision with a markingsuture and attached fibrofatty tissue.  The skin excision measures 110 x 71 x 10mm and the attached fibrofatty tissue measures 115mm in maximum dimension.  On the skin surface there is an irregular shaped tan lesion measuring 70 x 40mm,the medial margin is clear by 15mm, the lateral margin is clear by 10mm.  The posterior margin appears involved by the lesion.  The medial aspect inked in blue and the lateral aspect inked in black.  Specimen serially transversely sectioned from anterior to posterior.  Sections of the lesion from anterior to posterior serially embedded in block 1 to 57.  Please refer to the diagram.    
C.  Specimen labelled "Skin tag" consists of a piece of unorientated ellipse of skin with attached fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 15 x 20mm.  On the skin surface there is a pedunculated tan lesion measuring 15 x 10mm.  The closest pole is clear by 12mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  The specimen isserially transversely sectioned.  
Blocks:  1 - two ends; 2 & 3 - lesion; 4 - representative section of the normal looking skin.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Medial left inguinal lymph" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 45 x 20mm.  Four lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 - 15mm.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2- one lymph node; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one lymph node.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 30 x 15mm.  One lymph node identified measuring 20 x 10 x 15mm.  Serially transverse sectioned.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - entire lymph node.  (TO: Sterger  Brennen/mm 28.11.64) 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Metastatic SCC (Further history - patient has vulval SCC)
Phone result to Dr Q Salesky by Dr Q Coniglio/Q Lonny-Overhulser at 11.20am on 26.11.64.
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Q Follick)
A.  Sections show a 25mm deposit of metastatic moderately to well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in one of two lymph nodes (1/2). There is focal extranodal extension up to 1.1mm. 
B.  The radical anterior vulva has been embedded in its entirety. Sections show moderately to well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive lichen sclerosus. Carcinoma extends up to 6.0mm in depth. No convincing lymphovascular space or perineural invasion is seen. There is no evidenceof extramammary Paget's disease. 
The margins of excision are as follows:
Medial margin: 7.7mm 
Lateral margin: 8.0mm 
Deep margin: 15mm. 
Anterior and posterior margin: Clear of carcinoma. 
C.  Sections are of skinto subcutis and show a benign (pedunculated) intradermal naevus. Naevus cells extend from the superficial to deep dermis, between and adjacent to adnexal structures, as sheets, single cells and small nests. There is maturation of naevus cells towards the deep aspect of the lesion. Dermal mitoses are inconspicuous and there is no significant junctional component. Naevus cells are seen 0.56mm from the peripheral margin and are clear of the deep margin. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
D.  Sections of the medial left inguinal lymph nodesshow no evidence of malignancy in three lymph nodes (0/3). 
E.  Sections of the right inguinal lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Leftinguinal lymph node: 25mm deposit of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (1/2). 

B.  Radical anterior vulva: Squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of extensive lichen sclerosus, margins appear clear. 

C.  Skin lesion: Intradermal naevus, 0.56mm to peripheral margin. 

D.  Medial left inguinal lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/3). 

E.  Right inguinal lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/1).
