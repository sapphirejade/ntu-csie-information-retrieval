CLINICAL:
Left breast Ca.  Left breast lesion and sentinel node.  Left breast Ca - 3 o'clock 3cm from nipple.  Long suture - lateral, short - superior, medium - medial.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary central lymph node" consists of a lymph node measuring 60mm in maximum dimension.  Serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast lesion" consistsof a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 65mm (medial to lateral) x 60mm (superficial to deep) x 30mm (superior to inferior).  There is a hookwire entering from the lateral aspect and protruding through the medial aspect of the breast.The specimen has been x-rayed.  The specimen is inked as follows:  Superior red, inferior green, superficial blue, deep black and serially sectioned from medial to lateral.  There is a soft tan tumour within slices six to eight measuring12 x 10 x 6mm.  The margins are as follows:  9mm superior, 11mm inferior, 3mm superficial, 22mm deep, approximately 30mm lateral and 60mm medial.
Blocks:  1 - representative medial margin; 2 & 3 - slice two; 4 to 6 - slice five; 8 to 11 - slice six; 12 to 15 - slice seven; 16 to 18 - slice eight; 19 to 21 - slice nine; 22 to 25 - slice ten lateral margin.  (TO: NO; YP/rt 25.12.65); 26 to 28 -  slice three; 29 to 32 - slice four; 33 & 34 - remainder of slice one.  AE.  (TO: PB: JN/ta 28/12/65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Yorck):
Sections show a 16mm grade 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma rising in association with encysted papillary carcinoma, as well as low to intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).  The infiltrating carcinoma is predominantly composed  of well formed tubules lined by cells with grade 2 nuclei and inconspicuous mitoses.  The invasive tumour is present adjacent to a 16mm circumscribed and partially encapsulated focus of encysted papillary carcinoma.  The latter is composed of complex arrangement of tubules and papillae lined by cells with monomorphic low to intermediate grade nuclei expanding a duct space.  There is either complete loss, or a significant reduction of myoepithelial cells around the perimeter of the proliferation as demonstrated with CK5/6 and P63 immunostains.  The encysted papillary carcinoma  involves adjacent branch ducts and merges with ducts showing low to intermediate grade DCIS.  Within the vicinity of the tumour there is admixed flat epithelial atypia and columnar cell hyperplasiawith superimposed architectural atypia equivalent to atypical ductal hyperplasia.  There are several outlying small intraduct papillomas, including one cut in several profiles, some of which are partially expanded by a monomorphic proliferation of epithelial cells equivalent to atypical ductal hyperplasia.  This papilloma extends to the superficial margin.

Miscellaneous:  A spectrum of columnar cell lesions include columnar cell change, columnar cell hyperplasia, columnarcell hyperplasia with superimposed architectural atypia equivalent to ductal carcinoma in situ.  There are also several benign intraduct papillomas including one that extend to the superior margin and another that extends to the superficial margin.  Another small intraduct papilloma with atypical ductal hyperplasia extends to the  superficial margin.
