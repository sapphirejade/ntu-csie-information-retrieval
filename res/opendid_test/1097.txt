CLINICAL:
Metastatic cancer ?colorectal primary. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Omentum secondary", consists of a piece of omentum 120 x 100 x 30mm.  On sectioning there are multiple fibrotic white ill-defined nodules identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - representative sections from the nodules. Block 3 reserved block.
(IC/vo 5.9.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Bonnot):
Sections show omental fat with metastatic adenocarcinoma. The lesion has a complex glandular architecture, and is composed of tumour cells with pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei.
The tumour cells are positive for CK7 and CK20. TTF-1 is negative.
COMMENT
AlthoughCK7 staining is unusual for a colorectal lesion, the morphology is similar to the previous biopsy of the primary caecal lesion (43J4756). The overall findings would favour a colorectal primary.

DIAGNOSIS:
Omentum: metastatic adenocarcinoma, favour colorectal origin (see comment)
