HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

CLINICAL NOTES:
1.  Liver surface lesion
2.  Small bowel mesentery
?Recurrent colon cancer.  Frozen section
Multiple small bowel resections (metastatic colorectal carcinoma)

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;LIVER SURFACE LESION&amp;quot;.  Brown tissue 8x5x4mm, trisected.  Sectioning shows a pale cut surface.  Middle section for frozen section.

Frozen section report:  &amp;quot;Suspicious for met adenoca.  Specimen is heavily diathermied making interpretation difficult&amp;quot;.

(1 frozen section; 2 remainder).  AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY&amp;quot;.  Pale fatty tissue 7x5x5mm.  AE (1-1)

Frozen section result:  &amp;quot;Metastatic adenoca&amp;quot;.

Results phoned to Theatre, Surgical Registrar, 10:52 by E. Darren on 26/5/71.

C.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Multiple pieces including seven pieces of small bowel.  The larger piece measures 180mm in length and 60mm in maximum diameter.  The mesentery is attached, 35mm.  Multiple adhesions over the serosal surface are present.  No definite mucosal lesion identified.
The rest of the small bowel ranges from 40-70mm. Multiple adhesions over the surface also present.

(1-3 section from larger piece; 4-8 section from each separate small bowel piece; 9 tumour block).  RS (M-9/SM 29/6/2068 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. L. Rall)
A.  The diathermied tissue shows extensive desmoplasia infiltrated by adenocarcinoma glands.

B.  The fibrofatty tissue shows desmoplasia surrounding adenocarcinoma glands, which infiltrate through dense smooth muscle fibres presumed to be part of the muscularis propria.

C.  The small bowel resection margins are viable.  The mesentery shows deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma surrounded by desmoplasia.  These invade up through the muscularis propria into the submucosa and into the mucosa in some areas.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  LIVER SURFACE LESION - METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
B.  SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY - METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
C.  SMALL BOWEL -METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
