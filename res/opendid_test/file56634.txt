BREAST INVASIVE CARCINOMA SYNOPTIC REPORT (based on CAP guidelines 2019):

INVASIVE CARCINOMA:

Maximum invasive tumour size:   25 mm diameter, x 20 mm x 16 mm (see ammendment)

Histologic type:  Mucinous carcinoma

Histologic grade:  Grade 2

Scores: Tubules 3, Nuclei 2,  Mitoses 1;  Total Score: 6 of 9

Mitotic rate:  0 mitoses per 10 high power fields

Whole tumour size (invasive + DCIS):  approximately 60 mm

Peritumoural lymphovascular invasion:  Not identified

Perineural invasion:  Not identified

Skin involvement:  Not identified

Dermal lymphovascular invasion: Not identified

Nipple involvement:  Not identified. No Paget disease.

Skeletal muscle involvement:  Not applicable

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present, associated with invasive carcinoma.
Size (extent) of DCIS: approximately 60 mm diameter
Nuclear grade: Grade I to II (low grade to intermediate grade)
Architecture/type: cribriform, papillary, with mucinous features.
Necrosis:  Not identified
Calcification of DCIS: Not identified
Extensive intraductal component (EIC): Negative

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):
Present, several foci, classical type

MARGINS:
Invasive carcinoma margins:
Margin status, invasive carcinoma: Negative margins, tumour free

Distance of invasive carcinoma from margins:
Anterior (inferior edge part of anterior margin): 2 mm (sections B3, 5)
Posterior: 7 mm

DCIS margins:
DCIS margin status:  Close negative margin (0 - 1.9 mm), see NOTE#
NOTE#:
Due to the growth pattern of DCIS in the ductal system, a negative but close margin does not ensure the absence of DCIS in the adjacent tissue
Distance of DCIS from margins:
Anterior (inferior edge part of anterior margin): 1 mm (section B5)
Posterior: 7 mm

ANCILLARY TESTS / IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
Block B5. Other suitable tumour block for testing: B10

Invasive carcinoma:
ER:      Positive, 90% of nuclei, 3+
PR:      Positive, 90% of nuclei, 3+
Her-2:  Negative (score 0 by Immunohistochemisty)
Ki-67:   15% labelling index
chromogranin A: negative
synaptophysin: negative

DCIS Immunostains:
The DCIS lesion shows uniform ER positive staining with no CK5/6 staining. There is luminal and focal intracytoplasmic mucin and a few PAS positive cytoplasmic granules. Chromogranin A is negative. There is focal positive staining with synaptophysin.

Separate findings:
Fibrocystic change, epithelial hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis

LYMPH NODES:
A. LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE:
Sentinel lymph nodes negative for tumour involvement
Nodes with macrometastases: 0
Nodes with micrometastases:  0
Nodes with isolated tumour cells: 0
Total number of nodes examined: 2
DIAGNOSIS:

- 25 mm diameter,
- mucinous carcinoma,
- grade 2,
- Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) component around invasive tumour and adjacent tissue,
- Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) present,
- Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margins 2 mm,
- Distance of DCIS from closest margins: 1 mm.

Supplementary report and ammendment: 7/2/2071
The case was discussed at the breast MDT 05-Jan-2071. The specimen was reexamined with reference to the ultrasound report of two tumour masses in 8 oclock area (both biopsied).  In the 8 oclock area the posterior divided part of the breast, adjacent to the previously described carcinoma there is further mucinous tumour 30 mm x 15 mm. This was partly sampled and was mistakenly included with the originally reported tumour in the adjacent anterior part of the same region, but is larger than in the original sections, and given the further clinical information appears to be separate but adjacent mucinous carcinomas of similar appearance (multifocal lesions). In addition, around the main mucinous tumour masses particularly in sections between the main tumours and towards central breast there are dilated ducts or rounded nodules containing mucin. There are several of these structures with mucin up to about 5 mm diameter but are larger in aggregate.

Further sections:
B25-27 mucinous tumour around 7-8 oclock area, anterior part of breast, 10 mm from inferior margin. 25 includes inferior edge, 25,26 include deep margin;
28-30 similar adjacent section, 28 includes inferior margin, 28,29 include deep plane; 31,32,33 cystic areas roughly 7 oclock area separate and central to main tumour masses; LV
The further sections show similar mucinous carcinoma grade 2. The invasive carcinoma size is amended based on further sections and imaging findings to:

- 25 mm diameter, x 20 mm x 16mm reported above
and
- 30 mm x 15 mm
- In addition the DCIS around the tumour is dilated with mucin and there are is a small satellite focus of mucinous carcinoma of similar appearance in 7 oclock region 5 mm diameter with adjacent dilated DCIS with mucinous DCIS (sections B6, B31).
The further sections of margins are unchanged.
AMMENDED DIAGNOSIS:

A.  LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY:
- Sentinel lymph nodes negative for tumour involvement (0/2).
B.  LEFT MASTECTOMY STITCH SUPERIOR:
- two adjacent mucinous carcinomas up to 30 mm and 25 mm diameter, and further third satellite nodule of mucinous carcinoma 5 mm diameter (multifocal invasive carcinoma),
- grade 2,
- ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) component around invasive tumour and adjacent tissue,
- lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) present,
- distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margins 2 mm,
- distance of DCIS from closest margins: 1 mm.
