CLINICAL:
Anterior vulva cancer.  Anterior vulva lesion. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left inguinal lymph node", consists of fibrofatty tissue 25 x 20 x 20mm.  One bisected lymph is identified 10 x 10 x 10mm.  Half for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2- the rest of the lymph node; 3 - fat.  AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative for tumour.
Phone results to Theatre by Dr N Benimadho at 10:00am on 30.12.64
B.  Specimen labelled "Left side inguinal lymph node-left", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue ranging from 40 to 65mm.  Five lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 to 35mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 and 3 - sections of one lymph node; 4 - one bisected lymph node; 5- one lymph node; 6 to 8 - one lymph node. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal lymph node", consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue ranging from 10to 60mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 to 20mm.  
Blocks: 1 - one possible lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - ?two lymph nodes; 4 to 6 - sections of one lymph node.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left medial femoral lymph node", consists of two possible lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 10mm.  AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left femoral lymph node", consists of a 7 x 5 x 5mm lymph node with attached fibrofatty tissue 
Blocks: 1 lymph node; 2 - fibrofatty tissue.  AE.
F.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vulva stitch at 12 o'clock", consists of an orientated ellipse of skin with attached fibrofatty tissue.  The ellipse of skin measures  120 x 85 x 25mm.  On the skin surface there is a raised firm nodule.  It measures 25 x 21mm.  The 3 o'clock margin is clear by 12mm, the 9 o'clock margin is clear by 10mm and the 6 o'clock pole is clear by 20mm.  The 3 o'clock half is inked blue, the 9 o'clock half is inked black and the 6 o'clock pole is inked green.
Blocks: 1 to 20 - five transverse sections through the main tumour; 21 to 23 - longitudinal section of the 12 o'clock end; 24 and 25 - longitudinal section of 6 o'clock end; 26 and 27 - sectionss through the green inked surgical margin.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. N Bogar):
A.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  No lymph nodes are present.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.  The tumour has a maximum depth of 4.3mm, width of 18mm and length of 18mm.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The carcinoma is well clear of all peripheral and deep margins (at least 10mm).
A small amount of adjacent differentiated VIN and lichen sclerosis is noted.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, depth 4.3mm, width 18mm, length 18mm.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Margins clear.  Eleven negative lymph nodes.
