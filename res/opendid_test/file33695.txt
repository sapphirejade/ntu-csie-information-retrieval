Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
44yo.  BMI 60.  Ca 125 39 for surgical staging.  Midline laparotomy RSO and left cystectomy.  PCOS.  HTN.  Obesity.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a cystic ovary, 145 x 140 x 85mm with a distorted tube, 65 x 7mm.  Outer surface is generally smooth.  Cut surface shows a multilocular cyst containing thin watery fluid.  No solid or papillary areas are seen.  The cyst walls are thin, with smooth inner lining.  Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - RS fimbrial end of fallopian tube with attached underlying tumour; 4 - representative TS remaining fallopian tube; 5 to 19 - RS tumour.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous cystadenoma.
Results to Anaesthetist by Dr E Alanko at 11:15am on 17/01/68

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus (received fresh), there is no attached cervix, fallopian tubes or ovaries.  The specimen weighs 57g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 45 x 36mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The anterior soft tissue margin inked blue and posterior soft tissue margin inked black.  The endometrium is 4mm in thickness.  The myometrium is 16mm in thickness and is unremarkable.  There is a small area of pallor in the left posterior fornix region, 2 x 2mm in size, on the endometrial surface.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 8 - section of pallor in the left posterior fornix; 9 to 24 - further sections of endometrium in the anterior uterus embedded from left to right, and composite sections are embedded from superior to inferior; 24 to 34 - remainder of posterior endometrium embedded from right to left, and composite sections are embedded superior to inferior.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue, 25 to 50mm in size and 50 x 55 x 30mm in aggregate.  No macroscopic abnormalities are identified.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - RS.   (TO: LK/ta 17/1/68)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Knuckles):
A.  Sections show a serous cystadenoma of the ovary.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  The endometrium shows focal grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium arising on a background of complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia.  No myometrial invasion is present.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen and the lower segment appears clear of tumour.  The myometrium shows no significant abnormality.

C.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Left tube and ovary, uterus and omentum:
- Benign serous cystadenoma of the left ovary.
- Focal grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
- No myometrial invasion present
- Omentum negative.
ADDENDUM (1/2/68):
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins (Block B28)

MLH1          Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2          Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2          Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6          Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
