HISTORY:  
Ovarian cancer.  Peritonectomy.  Roof of liver cyst, rectal strip, omentum, uterus, ovaries.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  'UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES, OVARIES, OMENTUM AND PERITONEAL DISEASE'.  Received multiple tissue fragments: 
A uterus with attached adnexa of a total weight of 90g. The uterus measures 55x40x23mm.  The outer surface has two hard yellow nodules on the body posteriorly measuring 10 and 6mm.  There is an anterior peritoneal reflection measuring 90x50x5mm with a single yellow deposit 6mm.  Anterior cervical margin is inked blue, posterior black.  The external os is slit like 5x2mm with surrounding haemorrhagic ectocervix.  The identified endometrium is up to 3mm thick.  The myometrium is up to 11mm.  The myometrium contains multiple small white whorled nodules ? fibroid about average diameter of 5mm.  
The right fallopian tube measures 40x6mm.  The right ovary measures 25x15x10mm.  The left tube measures 52x6mm.  The left ovary measures 24x20x10mm.  The outer surface of the left tube is ragged, haemorrhagic witha nodule attached to the fimbrial end measuring 24x15x13 mm with hard yellow cut surface and appears to be separate of the left ovarian tissue.  The cut surface of the right ovary and tubes are unremarkable.  
Received also three pieces of fibrofatty tissue with covered peritoneum at one surface measuring 100x65x10mm, 85x55x15mm and 15x6x10mm. The smallest has a firm yellow deposit 5mm.  The medium segment has a firm white nodule measuring 100mm (? lymph node).
Received also a piece of omentum measuring 450x165x20mm.  At least three separate nodules are seen amongst the omentum of a diameter of  25mm, 16 and 5 mm  all have firm yellow and white cut surface.  
(1 cervix; 2 body; 3 fundus; 4 deposit at posterior body; 5 anterior peritoneal deposits; 6 right fimbrial tube two LS; 7 right tube three TS; 8 two TS right ovary; 9 left fimbrial end trisected; 10-17 left tube and ovary from distal to proximal including the left tube mass; 18and19 peritoneal deposits [separate piece of tissue]; 20-22 omental nodules).  RS (M-22)
B.  'ROOF OF LIVER CYST'.  Unorientated fibrous piece of tissue appears to be  remnant of cyst measuring10x9x2mm.  Bisected.  AE (2-1)
C.  'RECTAL STRIP'. Two unorientated fibrofatty piece of tissue including a serosal surface.  They measures 65x40x10mm and 50x40x10mm.  On the serosal surface of the largest piece there are fourfirm yellow deposits measuring 4mm, 3mm, 3mm and 4mm.  At the smaller pieces there are two nodules measuring 14 and 5mm.  
(1and2 each two TS smaller piece with nodules; 3and4 larger piece nodules).  RS (M-4/EH/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  
A.  Uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, omentum and peritoneal disease:  
There are variably sized deposits of serous carcinoma involving much of the tissue samples. Many of the deposits are small and some have few of no associated epithelial cells and are represented mainly as psammoma bodies. Other larger deposits have areas of necrosis. Viable serous carcinoma is present in several of the deposits. The serous carcinoma involves uterine serosa; right tube fimbria, with adjacent invasion of right tube; limited right ovary surface involvement; a left paratubal nodule of carcinoma, partly necrotic; limited invasion of left ovary; separate peritoneal tissue; and omentum. The most viable area of carcinoma isin specimen C. See below for comment. 
Other tissues:
The ectocervical mucosa is atrophic. Endocervical mucosa is normal. The endometrium is atrophic.
B.  Roof of liver cyst:   Sections of liver show a subsurface cyst or cyst locule lined by a monolayer of benign biliary epithelium consistent with a benign biliary cyst or part of more a complex cystic lesion depending on how representative. 
C.  Rectal strip:    Sections showa fibrofatty peritoneal tissue with fibrous granulation tissue and adhesions. In one of the sections there is approximately 8 mm diameter of serous carcinoma. This is partly fibrotic but has areas of well preserved viable serous carcinoma, high grade, with typical histologic features, and a high mitotic rate. 
Comment:
Many of the other deposits of serous carcinoma described above show variable degenerate changes and are difficult to grade and presumably some of the changes represent partial response to previous treatment. Correlation with previous findings recommended to assess overall response. The serous carcinoma may be of fallopian tube origin, the primary site of origin is difficult to say on the current specimens. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, omentum and peritoneal disease: Multiple deposits of serouscarcinoma, variable cellularity with variable degenerative changes, involving most sampled intraperitoneal organs. 
B.  Roof of liver cyst:  Part of benign biliary cyst. 
C.  Rectal strip:  Nodular deposit of viable high grade serous carcinoma.
