SEALS HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

*SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ATTACHED*
HISTORY:
Tumour markers normal. Previous laporascopic hysterectomy and morcellation. L ovarian mass - complex on ultrasound and peritoneal washings. For frozen section. 
Clear cell ca on frozen. Appendiceal epiploicae, right ovary and tube, appendix, omentum, left pelvic node, left para-aortic node. 

MACROSCOPIC:
A. "LEFT OVARIAN MASS". A solid/cystic ovarian mass, it weighs 324g and measures 120x75x70mm. Specimen previously sectioned for frozen section. The surface is smooth. It is partially cystic and partially solid. The solid component makes up approximately 70% of the lesion and the cystic component 30%. On sectioning through the solid patch it has a pale to tan solid cut surface with scattered pale yellow areas. No normal residual ovarian tissue is identified.  Serosal surface inked blue. Two blocks for frozen section. 

F/S: "High grade carcinoma, favour clear cell". Reported by Dr F Strotman to TYRONE LINDWALL at 10.45hrs on 23.06.66. Also noted within the container is a clot with a adherent mucinous appearing material, measuring 100x70x10mm. 

(1&2 frozen section; 3 clot; 4-10 section of tumour solid aspect in relation to serosal surface; 11 pale yellow area centrally; 12 sections of cystic component of lesion). RS (M-12). 

B.  "RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE".  An ovary, no tube received, weighing 12g and measuring 35x25x20mm. There is attached fatty tissue up to 20mm wide. The surface is smooth. On sectioning the cut surface reveals a partially cystic and partially solid cut surface with areas of haemorrhage. RS (2-2).

C. "PERITONEAL BIOPSY". Haemorrhagic pieces of tissue in aggregate 12x8x3mm. AE (M-1).

D. "LEFT PARA-AORTIC NODE". One lymph node and multiple pieces of fatty tissue in aggregate 20x12x2mm. Lymph node by itself is 11mm in maximum dimension. RS (1-1).

E. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". A lymph node and a piece of fatty tissue in aggregate 40x35x10mm. Lymph node by itself is 40x15x6mm. 

(1&2 lymph node). RS (M-2).

F. "APPENDIX". A vermiform appendix with attached mesoappendix measuring 45mm in length by 6mm in maximum diameter. The mesoappendix is up to 20mm. The serosal surface is unremarkable and the base is inked blue. On sectioning there is fibrous obliteration of the tip. The wall is up to 3mm thick, lumen is patent with  haemorrhagic material. 

(1 LS base of tip; 2 TS through mid appendix). RS (M-2).

G. "APPENDICEAL EPIPLOICAE". Two pieces of haemorrhagic fatty tissue measuring  in aggregate 30x25x8mm. AE (2-2).

H. "OMENTUM". A piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum measuring 330x120x15mm. No firm or nodular areas are seen. RS (M-2/FH/ht).

MICROSCOPIC:    (Dr. F Burzynski)
A.  Sections of the left ovarian mass show a clear cell tumour with high grade nuclear features. The tumour has a predominantly tubulocystic pattern, with areas of papillary architecture.  In addition, there are a few focal areas where single cells are seen invading fibrotic stroma.  In these areas of single cell invasion, there is marked nuclear pleomorphism and occasional signet ring cell morphology.  In the tubulocystic areas, the tubules and cysts are lined with cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, clear cytoplasm, nuclear membrane irregularities and moderate variation in nuclear size and shape.  Nucleoli are inconspicuous.  In some areas, the stroma appears hyalinised, and in other areas the tubular structures have intraluminal pale myxoid material. Occasional intraluminal eosinophilic globular secretions are present.  Mitotic figures are easily found, and many of these are atypical.  Focally, there is involvement of the serosal surface of the ovary.  No unequivocal lymphovascular involvement is seen, although assessment is hampered by retraction artefact. The tumour shows a central area of necrosis and haemorrhage.  

Comment : The morphologic features on the routine stain are in keeping with high grade clear cell carcinoma, however, it is difficult to entirely exclude a metastasis from another site on the basis of the appearance on the routine stain.  Immunohistochemical stains are in progress, with a supplementary report to follow.

B.  Sections of the right ovary show a luteinised follicular cyst, together with several other small follicular cysts.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.

C.  Sections show fragments of fibrovascular tissue with extensive interstitial haemorrhage.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.

D.  The single lymph node shows reactive changes only.  

E.  The single lymph node shows reactive changes only.

F.  Sections of appendix show fibrous obliteration of the lumen.  There is no acute inflammation, and the serosal surface is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.

G.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with extensive interstitial haemorrhage.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.

H.  Sections show lobulated adipose tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.

DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  LEFT OVARIAN MASS : 
-HIGH GRADE MALIGNANT CLEAR CELL TUMOUR, WITH MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES ON THE ROUTINE STAIN WHICH FAVOUR HIGH GRADE  CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA.  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS ARE IN PROGRESS, (TO HELP EXCLUDE OTHER POSSIBLE PRIMARY SITES), WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT TO FOLLOW.

B.  RIGHT OVARY :
-FOLLICULAR CYSTS.

C.  PERITONEAL BIOPSY :
-NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

D.  LEFT PARA-AORTIC NODE :
-A SINGLE LYMPH NODE SHOWS REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

E.  LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE :
-THE SINGLE LYMPH NODE SHOWS REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

F.  APPENDIX -
-FIBROUS OBLITERATION OF THE LUMEN.

G.  APPENDICEAL EPIPLOICAE :
-REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

H.  OMENTUM :
-MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:
A.  Immunohistochemical stains on the clear cell tumour show positive staining for Keratins CAM5.2, Cytokeratin 7 and AE1/AE3.  PAX8 and NapsinA are also positive.  There is very focal weak positivity for p53.  Stains for GATA3, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, WT1, CEA, Cytokeratin 20, CD10, TTF1, OCT3/4, CDX2, and Alpha foetoprotein are all negative.  These results are in keeping with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. During review of the slides, a small focus of possible endometriosis was noted in the ovary. The above report and diagnosis remains otherwise unchanged.
