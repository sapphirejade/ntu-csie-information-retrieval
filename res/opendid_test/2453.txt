Sections show skin with replacement of dermis by acute on chronically inflamed granulation tissue.  In addition, within the papillary dermis there is metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of signet-ring differentiation in keeping with origin from an appendiceal primary.  Separately submitted granulation tissue fragments with suppurative inflammation are also present.
