CLINICAL NOTES:
Serous papillary endometrial Ca.
- Uterus + cervix + tubes + ovaries + pelvic bilateral tubes + omental biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS + TUBES, OVARIES, CERVIX&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus, cervix, attached bilateral tubes and ovaries, weighing 64g all together. Right tube measures 50mm in length, 5mm in diameter. Paratubal cyst is present. Serosa is present. Serosa is smooth. Sectioning is unremarkable. Right ovary measures 30x10x5mm. Sectioning is unremarkable. Left tube measures 40mm in length, 5mm in diameter. Sectioning is unremarkable. Left ovary measures 15x15x7mm. Sectioning is unremarkable.
Uterus measures 60x40x25mm. Serosa is smooth, grey. Anterior is inked blue, posterior is inked black. Specimen is received partially opened coronally. It is serially sliced sagittally. Anterior wall measures 11mm, posterior wall measures 13mm. There is a thickening of endometrium measuring 10x5mm with a thickness of 4mm in maximum dimension. No obvious myometrial invasion or extension of thickening area to the cervix identified.
(1 right parametrium; 2 left parametrium; 3 right tube; 4 right ovary; 5 left tube; 6 left ovary; 7-10 one full face sagittal view [7 cervix; 8 lower segment; 9 uterine wall; 10 fundus]; 11-14 more sections of endometrium). FURTHER TISSUE: 15-16 - remainder of fallopian tubes and ovaries RS (M-16)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC NODE&amp;quot;. Multiple fibrofatty tissues, measuring 40mm in aggregate. Two lymph nodes, 15mm each present.
(1 one lymph node, sliced; 2 one lymph node, sliced; 3 ?lymph node). AE (M-3)
C. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC NODE&amp;quot;. Multiple fatty tissues, 60mm. ?large lymph node fatty service, 30mm. Second fatty lymph node, 20mm.
(1 and 2 ?one lymph node; 3 one lymph node, sliced; 4 ?lymph node). AE (M-4)
D. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Consists of 40mm fatty tissue. No definite nodes identified. AE (M-1/SM 8/4/2068 cy)

LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Suspicious

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
Site: Specimen B ( Right Pelvic Node) and Specimen C (Left pelvic node)

Number of lymph nodes involved: 1 (This is in Specimen C - left pelvic node and measures in excess of 2mm in length)
Number of lymph nodes examined: 5 (Two nodes Specimen B, three nodes Specimen C)

B.  RIGHT PELVIC NODE -
-NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

C.  LEFT PELVIC NODE -
