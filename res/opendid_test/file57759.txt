Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Caecal cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled:  Right hemicolectomy

Specimen
Specimen length:  285mm
Length of terminal ileum:  90mm
Length of caecum/ascending colon:  195mm
Thickness of mesocolon:  100mm
Appendix:  70 x 5mm diameter.

Tumour
Location:  Within the proximal ascending colon/caecum on the posterolateral surface.
Description:  Broad-based exophytic mass with a mushroom like appearance. On sectioning, the tumour invades through muscularis propria into pericolic fat and appears to abut the serosa in the area where the serosa appears indented.
Maximum tumour diameter:  53mm
Perforation:  Absent
Appearance of serosa overlying tumour:  Indented
Distance of tumour to proximal cut end:  110mm
Distance of tumour to distal cut end:  150mm
Distance of tumour to circumferential margin:  Greater than 10mm

Other
Polyps:  None
Adherent structures:  None
Inked margins:  Proximal margin blue, distal margin black.

Blocks
1 - proximal and distal margins; 2 - two LS tip of appendix and three TS; 3 to 5 - tumour abutting serosa and invading into pericolic fat; 6 - apical tissue; 7 - apical node; 8 - one lymph bisected; 9 - one lymph node trisected; 10 - one lymph node quadrisected; 11 - two lymph nodes; 12 - one lymph node bisected; 13 - one lymph node trisected; 14 - one lymph node bisected; 15 - one lymph node bisected; 16 and 17 - one lymph node bisected each; 18 - 5 lymph nodes; 19 to 21 - two lymph nodes each.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Leffew):
Sections show mucinous adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  Tumour just penetrates through muscular propria into subserosal adipose tissue.  One (1) of the twenty-one (21) lymph nodes identified contains metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The features are as follows:

Type
Mucinous carcinoma

Local invasion
T3	Beyond muscularis propria

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not involved

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  21
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1

N1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN

Lymphovascular invasion
Absent

Perineural invasion
Absent

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
Appendix shows no significant abnormality.

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry
Not performed
