CLINICAL NOTES:
L breast ca + further posterior tissue.
Frozen section sentinel node L breast cancer.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL NODE FROZEN SECTION&amp;quot;. Two pale fatty nodes.
1. 10x8x6mm
2. 8x6x6mm.
1 x TS each node on one chuck.

F/S : &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;. Reported to Denver, THEODORE HOSPITAL by Dr. R. Foglia at 11:30 am on 14.01.73.

(1 remainder FS; 2 remainder lymph node 1; 3 remainder lymph node 2). Representative sections.  (M-3)

B. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;LEFT BREAST LESION&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Short - superior, Medium - medial, Long - lateral.&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE: Left
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Wide local excision oriented
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  Yes. Hookwire split and a metal clip both seen at H7 which is inked yellow
HOOKWIRE:  Yes. The hookwire enters from the inferior posterior aspect
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  45mm
Superior to inferior:  60mm
Anterior to posterior:  35mm
WEIGHT:  51g
SKIN:  No
NIPPLE:  No
MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  No
MARGIN INKED:
Non-standard:  Anterior blue, Posterior black, Lateral green, Medial red
DISSECTION: Cut from superior to inferior
Number of slices: 14
FINDINGS / LESION:  There was a small blue suture on the anterior side centrally holding tissue together, which was 5mm from the yellow ink. The yellow ink is in slice 9. There is a metal clip in the flip side of slice 10.
There is a firm nodule with the metal clip in it measuring 10x10x10mm in blocks 9-12. The lesion is 7mm from anterior, 14mm from posterior, 12mm from lateral, 12mm from medial, 40mm from superior, and 20mm from inferior. Adjacent to the nodule on the anterior side there is a possible nodule with a smooth surface which is 8mm across which abuts the anterior surface in slice 10 and in slices 3-5 there is a possible nodule, haemorrhagic area 10x8x8mm in slices 3-5.
(1-6 slice 1; 7-9 slice 3; 10-13 slice 4; 14-17 slice 7; 18-20 slice 9; 21-23 slice 10; 24-26 slice 12; 27-32 slice 14). Representative sections. (M-32)
C. Specimen labelled &amp;quot;LEFT BREAST FURTHER POSTERIOR TISSUE&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE: Left
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Wide local excision oriented
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  No
HOOKWIRE:  No
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  40mm
Superior to inferior:  30mm
Anterior to posterior:  14mm
WEIGHT:  7g
SKIN:  No
NIPPLE: No
MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  No
MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green. The tissue has three orienting sutures - a short, a medium and long (short is presumed superior, medium presumed medial, long presumed lateral [after discussion with Krystle Hackenberg).
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral
Number of slices: 7
FINDINGS / LESION:  The cut surface shows fatty tissue.
(1-3 slice 1; 4 slice 2; 5 slice 3; 6 slice 4; 7 slice 5; 8 slice 6; 7 slices 9-11). All embedded. (M-11/FR 17/1/2070 ank)
