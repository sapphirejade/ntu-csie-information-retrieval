CLINICAL NOTES:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenoca.
1. Peritoneal fluid.
2. Uterus, tubes + ovaries.
3. Omental biopsy.
4. Right sentinel node, left sentinel node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus with attache cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries. The uterus with attached cervix weighs 75g and it measures 65mm superior to inferior, 35mm intercornual distance. Ectocervix measures 30x30mm with an ovoid os 12x10mm.  Specimen is received partially opened by the surgeons.  The endometrium attached to the anterior wall is somewhat friable ? tumour.  It appears confined to the endometrium and not extending into the underlying myometrium. There is also a polypoid area measuring 10mm maximum dimension attached to the anterior myometrium.  Entire friable suspicious area within the endometrium is embedded.

(1 right parametrial tissue; 2 left parametrial tissue; 3 right cornu; 4 left cornu; 5-10 sagittal slice [5 anterior cervix, 6 anterior lower  uterine segment, 7 anterior endomyometrium, 8 posterior cervix; 9 posterior lower uterine segment, 10 posterior endomyometrium]; 11-18 sections of anterior endomyometrium suspicious for lesional tissue [14-16 includes the polypoid area, 17&amp;amp;18 in relation to fundus])

The right ovary and fallopian tube together weigh 4.7g.  Ovary measures 20x18x5mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning the cut surface is firm and normal appearing. The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The left ovary and fallopian tube together weigh 4.2g.  Ovary measures 20x15x9mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning the cut surface is firm and normal appearing.  The ovary shows one paratubal cyst 8mm maximum dimension.

(19 right fallopian tube; 20 right ovary; 21 left fallopian tube; 22 left ovary). RS (M-22)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30x30x5mm.  No nodal tissue identified.  AE (M-2)

C.  &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of pieces of fatty tissue 40x35x10mm.  No nodal tissue is identified macroscopically.  AE (M-20

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fat.  It measures 30x10x5mm.  AE (1-1/MC 10/8/2069 ank)
