CLINICAL:
Right ovarian mass.  Ca 125 = 41.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Endometrial curetting" consists of tan fragments and mucoid material 30 x 22 x 4mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + right ovary" consists of a morcellated ovary 100 x 95 x 30mm in aggregate.  There is a tubular fragment (?fallopian tube) 28mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The fragments of the ovary show solid pale to yellow and mucoid areas.
Blocks:  1 entire ?fallopian tube fragment; 2 to 11 - RS (11 - reserved block).
(TO: MA; RO/rt 27.8.65); 12 to 22 - more sections.  (TO: ZR:  BF/mm 1.9.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Hainds:
A.  Sections show proliferative endometrium.  Fragments of both endocervical and endometrial polyp are also present.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.  
B. The fragmented ovary is well sampled.  Sections show small foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising in association with a mixed serous and endometrioid borderline tumour.  The carcinoma is composed of several foci in which there are crowded endometrioid glands lined by stratified nuclei with grade 1 to 2 nuclear features within fibrous stroma, which in some areas appears altered and desmoplastic.  No solid architecture is seen.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  With immunostains the tumour shows WT1 expression and is p53 negative.  The tumour shows patchy moderate intensity expression for ER.  Although this immunoprofile is more typically seen in serous ovarian tumours there appears to be a significant admixture of serous and endometrioid borderline components and the carcinomatous component (Blocks B7, B20and B22) appears endometrioid in type.
The fallopian tube is entirely embeddedand examined and shows no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy.
Seen in consultation with Dr E Swarb.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Endometrial curettings:
-  Proliferative endometrium with fragments of endocervical and endometrial polyps.
B.  Right fallopian tube and right ovary:
-  Small foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising in association with an ovarian mixed serous and endometrioid borderline tumour.  
-   Unremarkable fallopian tube.
