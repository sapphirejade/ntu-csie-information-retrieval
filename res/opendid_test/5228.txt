Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer grade 3.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries, received opened (sagittal incision) in formalin.  The complete specimen weighs 140g.  The uterus measures 95 x 55 x 60mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 36 x 34mm and has unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, the myometrium is 34mm in maximum thickness, with no fewer than four fibroids measuring 5 to 12mm in maximum dimension.  There is a papilliform tumour at the fundal aspect of the endometrial cavity measuring 20mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour appears to extend to a depth of 5mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 55 x 7 x 5mm and the left ovary measures 20 x 17 x 9mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 57 x 7 x 5mm and the right ovary measures 27 x 13 x 8mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  AE.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - composite LS posterior uterus and cervix; 6 to 7 -left coronal sections of tumour/fundus; 8 to 10 - composite LS anterior uterus and cervix; 11 - representative fibroid; 12 - complete fimbrial end left fallopian tube, plus mid TS; 13 - RS left ovary; 14 - complete LS right fallopian tube, plus mid TS; 15 - representative right ovary.  RS.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 9mm, containing multiple lymph nodes.
Blocks:  1 - multiple lymph nodes; 2 - single lymph node, longitudinally bisected; 3 - multiple lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 35 x 22 x 17mm in aggregate, containing two lymph nodes.
Blocks:  1 - single lymph node; 2 - single lymph node; 3 - associated fibroadipose tissue.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 55 x 40 x 14mm in aggregate, containing multiplelymph nodes.
Blocks:1 - multiple lymph nodes; 2 - multiple lymph nodes; 3 - single lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 30 x 35 x 10mm, containing multiple lymph nodes.
Blocks:  1 - multiple lymph nodes; 2 - associated fibroadipose tissue.  AE.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a lymph node with a small amount of attached fibroadipose tissue measuring 25 x 14 x 9mm.  On sectioning, the lymph node has a small pale grey/yellow area measuring 3mm in maximum dimension.  BAE 1 block.  (TO: WB; ZU/rt 18.2.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Larrivee):
A.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 13mm through a wall 25mm thick.  A moderate amount of lymphvascular invasion is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Lymphatic invasion is seen in the right paraovarian soft tissues.  Otherwise the ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  One of nine lymph nodes shows a 1.5mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma.
C.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Three lymphnodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One lymph node shows almost total replacement by metastatic carcinoma.  
No extracapsular spread is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 13mm through a wall 25mm thick.  Cervix uninvolved.  Moderate lymphvascular invasion is present.  Two of twenty five (2 of 25) lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr L Windley)
MMRD immunoperoxidase stains were requested at the Gynaecology Tumour Board meeting because this patient has a history of bowel cancer as well as the current endometrial adenocarcinoma. 
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. In this case, there is strong and diffuse nuclear expression of all four antigens.
