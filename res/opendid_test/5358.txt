CLINICAL:
Pelvic tissue.  Anaemia.  Large pelvic mass, elevated Ca125.  Ovarian mass.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" received fresh, consists of an ovarian mass, 110 x 90 x 90mm with attached fallopian tube, 55 x 10 x 10mm.  The ovary has a haemorrhagic serosal surface and the mass is unilocular with a smooth haemorrhagic interior surface.  The cyst wall thickness is up to 10mm and is oedematous and haemorrhagic.  No solid areas are identified.  Representative sections x 2 for frozensection.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section de-blocked; 2- frozen section de-blocked; 3 to 13 - representative ovary; 14 & 15 - fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Haemorrhagic, no evidence of malignancy.  
Phone result to Dr O Swanigan by Dr O Howerter/O Hunstad at 2.25pm on 14.07.65.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 290 x 30 x 8mm.  No nodules or lymph nodes are found within the fibrofatty tissue.  Representative in 3 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix measuring 80mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The wall thickness is 3mm and the mucosa is unremarkable.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
Blocks:  1- proximal surgicalmargin; 2- LS proximal; 3 - three TS mid; 4 - two LS distal.  (TO: JD:  EE/mm 15.7.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr O Montpetit):
A.  Sections show a partially haemorrhagic infracted cyst wall surrounded by a rim of histiocytes with patchy haemosiderin deposition.  The ovarian cortex preserved at the periphery is infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.  Small organized thrombosed vessels are focally seen.  The calcified outlines of necrotic vessels can be visualized within the infracted zone.  Features are of a torted infracted cyst with no residual viable tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Sections of the fallopian tube show evidence of haemorrhage, necrosis, and calcification at the fimbrial end, incorporating into the viable areas.  The adjacent vessels show organized thrombi.  Multiple transmural foci of scarred hyalinized tissue with haemosiderin pigment can be seen.
B.  Sections of the omentum show a focus of endometriosis.  Two randomly identified lymph nodes display reactive type changes.
C.  The appendix shows proximal fibrous obliteration of the lumen and a focal area of subserosal cystic inclusion suggestive of endometriosis.  There are no features of acute suppurative inflammation.  No evidence of malignancy can be seen.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A.  Right tube and ovary:  Haemorrhagic infarction and scarring in the ovarian cyst and fallopian tube.  
B.  Omentum:   Focal endometriosis.
C.  Appendix:  Fibrous obliteration and possible focal endometriosis.
