CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma of axillary nodes, occult primary 2064.
55D72395 Cervical biopsy at 2 and 10 o'clock: HPV and CIN3.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled fallopian tubes and ovaries, cervix and uterus" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 140g in total.  The uterus measures 95 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 40mm and has a slightly dark red discoloration at the anterior ectocervix.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 17mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm long and 7mm in diameter and theright ovary measures 30 x 20 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm long and 5mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 18 x 5mm.  Anterior soft tissue margin is inked blue and posterior soft tissue margin is inked black.  Onsectioning the myometrium is unremarkable.  On sectioning, the right ovary shows a cystic lesion, 15 x 15 x 10mm.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and midline cervix ; 5 to 7 - left anterior cervix; 8 to 12 - right anterior cervix (serially embedded from midline to the lateral side); 13 to 16 - full LS posterior body and midline cervix; 17 to 20 - right posterior cervix, serially embedded from midline to the periphery; 21 to 25 - left posterior cervix, serially embedded from midline to the periphery; 26 to 28 - left anterior endometrium; 29 to 31 - right anterior endometrium; 32 to 34 - right posterior endometrium; 35 to 37 posterior endometrium; 38 - right fimbria end LS; 39 - right fallopian tube; 40 - right ovary; 41 - LS left fimbria end; 42 - TS left tube; 43 - left ovary.  (TO: OLIVER; MAXIMO/rt 29.10.65); 44 & 45 - right ovary; 46 - TS right tube; 47 - right tube; 48 - left ovary; 49 and 50 - left tube.  Tubes and ovariesall embedded (TO: CLAUDIO:  Abe/mm 30.10.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Bora):
The entire cervix has been embedded.  There is patchy ulceration.  Focal CIN 3 is present, and high grade CIN is present very focally at the vaginal margin.  There is no endocervical glandular dysplasia.  There is no evidence of invasion.
The endometrium has been extensively sampled and is unremarkable and proliferative.  The myometrium shows adenomyosis.  Both ovaries and tubes have been examined in their entirety and show no significant abnormality.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, ovaries and tubes:  CIN 3 (see above re margins).
