CLINICAL:
Stomach + lower oesophagus.  Lower oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
Additional information obtained:  Previous adjuvant chemoradiation.

MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Stomach + lower oesophagus" consists of a total gastrectomy including distal oesophagus.  The oesophagus measures 50mm in length x 55mm in open diameter.  The stomach measures 150 x 80 x 30mm.  The lesser curve measures 115mm in length and the greater curve measures 190mm in length.  There is attached lesser and greater omentum.  The lesser omentum is up to 40mm in maximum dimension and the greater omentum measures 300 x 200 x 20mm.  On opening the wall thickness is up to 5mm.  There is an ulcerated tumour within the gastro-oesophageal junction along the posterior wall of the stomach centred on the junction itself.  The tumourmeasures 50 x 40mm in area and possibly extends to the serosa where there is overlying omentum from the lesser curve.  The tumour is approximately 32mm from the proximal surgical margin (distal oesophagus) and approximately 135mm from thedistal surgical margin (antral surface).  The posterior surface is inked black and the anterior blue.  Lymph nodes are found within the lesser omentum.  Please see diagram.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative section of proximal margin; 4 & 5 - paired blocks TS through oesophagus adjacent to margin section; 6 & 7 - paired blocks adjacent to 4 & 5; 8 to 10 - full face through tumour; 11 to 13 -composite block tumour with areas of deepest invasion; 14 - distal margin; 15 - representative normal stomach away from the tumour; 16 & 17 - lymph nodes from lesser omentum; 18 to 20 - possible lymph nodes within greater omentum.  (QL/rt 19.2.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Kulesza & registrar Dr G Iller):
Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cardio-oesophageal junction.  The tumour invades to a depth of approximately 10mm coming to within 2mm of the radial margin.  The features are as follows:

Tumour location
Gastro-oesophageal junction
Histologic type
Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade
Grade 2 Moderately differentiated (50% to 95% of tumour composed of glands)

Pattern of growth
Infiltrating
Maximum tumour dimension 
50mm
Depth of invasion
(T3)  Adventitial connective tissue
Peritoneal involvement
Absent
Pleural involvement
Absent
Lymphatic and capillary space invasion
Absent

Vein and artery space invasion
Absent

Perineural invasion
Present

Degree of regression (AJCC)
Grade 3: Absent response - Minimal or no tumour kill; extensive residual cancer

SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS
Distance of carcinoma to proximal margin
32mm 
Distance of carcinoma to distal margin 
135mm
Distance of carcinoma to radial/circumferential margin
2mm
LYMPH NODE STATUS
Number of lymph nodes identified:  8
Number of positive lymph nodes:  0 (One lymph node shows treatment effect without tumour)
N0    No regional lymph node metastasis
Other pathologies
Barrett's mucosa - not identified
Gastritis - mild active chronic gastritis, no Helicobacter
SUMMARY:
Lower oesophagus andstomach 
- Moderatelydifferentiated adenocarcinoma at cardio-oesophageal junction
- ypT3 N0 MX
