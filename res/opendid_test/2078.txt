HISTORY:  
Appendix cancer. Redo peritonectomy.  Peritoneal nodule frozen section.  Peritoneum, small bowel, para-aortic lymph nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "PERITONEAL NODULE".  25x20x10mm fatty tissue containing firm area.2 x TS firm areas.  AE (M-3)
F/S : "Extracellular mucin with occasional neoplastic cells in keeping with pseudomyxoma peritonei".  Reported by Dr. V. Forslin on 15.1.65.
B.  "PERITONEAL DISEASE".  An aggregate of fragile brown tissue 60x50x20mm together with a piece of small bowel 110x30x20mm.  One end of the small bowel segment is formed by a stoma. The mucosa protrudes form the stoma by 25mm.  The serosal surface of the bowel segment is smooth, grey and shiny with fatty tissue attached up to 90mm x30mm.  
(1 LS stoma end LS; 2 non-stoma end LS; 3 TS stoma; 4 relationship of stoma to the skin; 5 RS of stoma; 6 TS of non-stoma site; 7 RS of non stoma end; 8 RS of other mucosa; 9&10 RS of fragile tissue; 11&12 lymph node from the fatty tissue). M-12-RS.
C. "PARA-AORTIC NODE". Three pieces of tissue, measuring 40x15x6mm, 10x10x4mm, 15x15x5mm.  AE (M-4/MM/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. V. Koinzan)
A.  Sections show aggregates of extracellular mucin within fibroblastic tissue including suture granulomas. No definite epithelium is identified within the mucin. 
B.  Sections of the stomal mucosa show villous atrophy with congestion and patchy erosion. Sections of the peri-stomal skin show mild epithelial hyperplasia and a mild perivascular chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Representative sections from the remainder of the specimen show unremarkable mucosa, and variable granulation tissue and immature scar tissue on the serosal aspect. No mucin is identified in relation to the bowel segment 
Sections of the separate tissue fragments show fibroadipose tissue with extensive suture granulomas and include deposits of extracellular mucin. Scanty strips and aggregates of mucinous epithelium are present within the mucin, in keeping with low grade mucinous neoplasm with pseudomyxoma peritonei pattern. There is no high grade cytology or infiltrative architecture. 
C.  Sections show reactive fibroadipose tissue including four benign reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of malignancy.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. PERITONEAL NODULE - 
 - EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN, CONSISTENT WITH PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI. 
B.  PERITONEAL DISEASE -
- EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN WITH SCANTY LOW GRADE MUCINOUS EPITHELIUM CONSISTENT WITH LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM, PSEUDOMYXOMA PATTERN. 
 - SMALL BOWEL SEGMENT WITH STOMAL END.
C.  PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - 
- FOUR BENIGN REACTIVE LYMPH NODES.
