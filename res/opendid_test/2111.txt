CLINICAL:
Right lower lobectomy lung cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right lower lobe" consists of a right lower lobe of lung, 175 x 150 x 80mmwith a pre-inflation weight of 348g.  The hilar margins and staple margins are inked blue.  Over the hilar aspect of the lung, posterior to the oblique fissure, is an area of pleural puckering 25mm across (inked black).  Underlying this area of puckering is an irregular tan tumour, 25 x 15 x 25mm.  The tumour lies immediately adjacent to a bronchus, and is at least 25mm clear of the bronchial margin.  The tumour abuts the overlying pleura.  The uninvolved lung contains occasional cystically dilated airspaces.  No other lesions identified.  
Blocks: 1 - bronchial shave margin; 2 - hilar vessels shave margins; 3 & 4 - cross section of tumour; 5 to 8 - tumour abutting pleura (6 - reserve block); 9 - uninvolved lung.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 4 LN R" consists of a lymph node measuring 7mm across.  AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Level 7 LN R" consists of a lymph node measuring 25 x 15 x 10mm.  Within the lymph node is a heavily calcified area.  AE 2 blocks (calcified area in block 2).  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Level 10 lymph node between upper lower lobe" consists of a lymph node measuring 20 x 15 x 12mm andtwo smaller fragments measuring 3 and 6mm across.  The smallest fragment appears to consist entirely of calcified material.
Blocks: 1 - lymph node trisected; 2 - second fragment; 3 - smallest fragment following decalcification.   AE.   (TO: SE; ZL/ta 22/6/65)
