CLINICAL:
Cervical cancer - radical hysterectomy.  Frozen section right tube + ovary and nodule, right external iliac lymph node, right obturator lymph node.  PHx methamphetamine.  Smoker.  


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of piece of adipose tissue, 50 x 30 x 8mm.  Blocks: 1 - RS for frozen section; 2 to 4 - remainder of specimen.  AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 60 x 30 x 10mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified, 15 and 20mm.  
Blocks: 1 - RS smaller node for frozen section; 2 - RS larger node for frozen section; 3 - remainder of smaller lymph node; 4 to 6 - remainder of largerlymph node.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary and nodule" consists of a fallopian tube, 60 x 4 x 4mm, with attached ovary, 35 x 15 x 12mm, and adipose tissue.  There are several peritoneal cystic nodules, 3 to 4mm, on the tubal and ovarian serosa.  
Blocks: 1 - ovary for frozen section; 2 - fallopian tube with serosal nodule for frozen secton; 3 to 5 - remainder of ovary; 6 to 9 - remainder fallopian tube (8 & 9 with paratubalsoft tissue).
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
A & B.  No tumour seen.  
C.  Benign.

D.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with cervix and left fallopian tube and ovary, received unopened in formalin, weighing 102g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 95 x 50 x 40mm.  The ectocervix is 40 x 30mm.  There is posterior vaginal cuff, 4mm in length, and parametrial fat 25mm in width.  The left margin is inkedblue, right black and posterior vaginal cuff red.  A false cut was created in the posterior cervix on opening the specimen.  Surrounding the cervical os, involving both anterior and posterior cervix, is an ulcerated tumour, 25 x 12mm.  The tumour appears to extend into the endocervical canal, with a total length of 32mm.  The tumour infiltrates into the outer wall of the cervix, predominantly over the posterior wall, to a depth of 8mm through a wall thickness of 12mm.  The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometrium is 17mm thick.  The left fallopian tube is 45mm in length and 5mm diameter.  The left ovary is 30 x 15 x 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 12 - anterior cervix serially embedded from right to left; 13 to 25 - anterior endocervix and parametrium serially embedded from right to left; 26 &27 - anterior uterine body; 28 to 38 - posterior cervix serially embedded from left to right; 39 - left posterior parametrial fat; 40 to 49 - posterior endocervix serially embedded from left to right (blocks 41 to 47 include false cut); 50 to 52 - posterior uterine body; 53 - left fallopian tube; 54 - left ovary.  Cervix AE.  Specimen photograph taken.  Please see block diagram.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue, 55 x 35 x 15mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified, 12 and 35mm across.  Blocks: 1 to 4 - largest lymph node; 5 - smaller lymph node.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of adipose tissue, 55 x 55 x 15mm in aggregate.  Three lymph nodes are identified, 15, 40 and 50mm.  Blocks: 1 to 4 - largest lymph node; 5 to 9 - second lymph node; 10 - third lymph node.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator node" consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue,60 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified ranging from 2 to 25mm across.  Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node; 3 & 4 - one lymph node; 5 - multiple lymph nodes.
H.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue, 40 x 40 x 10mmin aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3 to 35mm across.  Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node; 3 & 4 - multiple lymph nodes.   (TO: SR; MA/ta 2/3/66) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Fross):
A.  The sections show adipose tissue only.  The entire specimen has been embedded and no lymph node is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  One out of two lymph nodes shows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (1/2) identified only on the deeper levels of the paraffin sections.  The tumour deposit is 2mm, with no convincing extranodal spread. 
C.  The sections show prominent Walthard rests over the tubal and ovarian serosa.  Focal endosalpingiosis is seen.  The fallopian tube and ovary show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  The sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, with essentially circumferential cervical involvement.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 10mm through a wall thickness of 12mm.  The tumour length is 31mm and the estimated width is 25mm.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is present.  The carcinoma is at least 6mm clear of the closest vaginal margin.  Adjacent changes of CIN3 are present, and this is clear of the vaginal margin.  
The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  Within the myometrium there is focal adenomyosis.  The left fallopian tube and ovary show no significant abnormality.  
Three benign parametrial lymph nodes are identified (0/3).
E.  The sections show two lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/2).
F.  The sections show three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/3).
G.  The sections show eight lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/8).
H.  The sections show five lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/5).
Representative sections seen with Dr N Ostwald.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A to H.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, and bilateral pelvic lymph nodes:
-  Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.
-  Tumour depth 10mm through wall 12mm thick.
-  Tumour length 31mm, tumour width 25mm.
-  Focal lymphaticinvasion.
-  Total one out of twenty-three lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (1/23).
