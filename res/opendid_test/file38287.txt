MONASH MEDICAL CENTRE - CLAYTON CAMPUS AND SUTHERLAND HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritonectomy - rectosigmoid cancer.
1. Peritoneal nodule left iliac fossa bit
2. Scar tissue
3. Right diaphragm
4. Gallbladder, right diaphragm, fibroid, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, FIBROID, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Multiple components in the same jar including
A gallbladder 90x30x30mm. The serosa mostly appears smooth and green.  Some irregularity is noted over the surface.  The wall thickness measures up to 7mm.  The mucosa appears velvety.  No lesion identified macroscopically.
There is a circumscribed nodule 45x40x40mm, composed of white whorled nodule, completely calcified.  Some soft resection achieved.
A strip of diaphragm, 100x80x10mm.  No obvious nodule identified.
Pieces of peritoneum 100x70x20mm identified.  Some circumscribed nodules identified filled with gelatinous material.

(1&amp;amp;2 gallbladder; 3 soft tissue attached to the fibroid; 4 one shave of fibroid; 5&amp;amp;6 possible diaphragm; 7-15 sections from peritoneum ?nodules; 16 tissue banking).  RS (M-16).

B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE LEFT ILIAC FOSSA BIT&amp;quot;.  A strip of fibrous tissue 5x2mm.  AE (1-1)

C.  &amp;quot;SCAR TISSUE&amp;quot;.  Fibrofatty tissue 20x7x5mm.  The outer surface inked blue, serially sliced.  AE (M-1).

D.  &amp;quot;RIGHT DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;.  Circumscribed grey nodule 15x10x5mm.  The outer surface inked blue, sliced.  AE (M-1/SM 14/10/2069 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr Q Pennacchio)
A. Sections show focal deposits of adenocarcinoma within a piece of fibroadipose tissue. There is central necrosis and abundant apoptotic debris consistent with colorectal adenocarcinoma. There is accompanying foreign body reaction to suture material.

The macroscopically described calcifed nodule is a calcified leiomyoma with no atypical features. immunostains confirm SMA and desmin positivity and CD117 negativity.

Other sections show gallbladder and strips of liver with no significant pathology. A small amount of splenic tissue is also present.

B. Sections show fibrous tissue with a multinucleated giant cell. There is no evidence of metastatic disease.

C. Sections show adipose tissue with fat necrosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.

D. Sections show dense fibrous tissue with central granulation tissue and focal adenocarcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. GALLBLADDER, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, FIBROID, PERITONEAL DISEASE -
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
- CALCIFIED LEIOMYOMA.

B. PERITONEAL NODULE LEFT ILIAC FOSSA -
- FIBROUS TISSUE.
C. SCAR TISSUE -
- FAT NECROSIS.
D. RIGHT DIAPHRAGM -
- FOCAL METASTATIC CARCINOMA.
