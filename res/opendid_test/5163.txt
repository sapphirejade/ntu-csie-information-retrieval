HISTORY:  
Pelvic peritoneum.  Umbilicus.  Liver lesion segment8.  Peritoneal nodule.  Right hemicolectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE".  
Right Hemicolectomy - A right hemicolectomy measuringup to 270mm in length including 160mm of terminal ileum.  Located at the ileocaecal valve there is a circumferential tumour extending through the bowel wall.  In this area the overlying serosa and peritoneal surface is puckered and adhered. The mucosa is otherwise unremarkable. There is no appendix identified macroscopically.  On opening the tumour is forming a stenosis in the terminal ileum proximal to the ileocecal valve and the tumour measures up to 40x30x20mm.  On the serosal surface there an adherent piece of fat with peritoneal lining showing some small ? adhesions ? tumour deposit on the surface.  In the ascending colon there is a diverticula noted.  An apical node is identified.
(1 LSresection margin; 2 mesenteric tumour deposit; 3&4 paired tumour with puckered serosal surface; 5&6 further tumour with serosal surface; 7 tumour reserve block; 8 ascending colon diverticulum; 9 apical node transversely sectioned; 10 three possible nodes; 11 two possible nodes; 12 two possible nodes; 13 two possible nodes)
Gallbladder - A gallbladder measuring 65mm in length and 20mm in diameter.  There is no cystic duct lymph node identified. The external surface is smooth and shiny.  On opening the mucosa shows diffuse cholesterolosis.  
(14 TS resection margin; 15 two TS body; 16 two LS fundus)
Peritoneal Disease - Multiple strips of peritoneum measuring 50x50x30mm.  There is some irregular ragged areas ? adhesions ? tumour deposit.
(17&18 RS)
Omentum - Omentum measuring up to 490x200x30mm.  On sectioning there is some firmer haemorrhagic areas, however, no definite tumour deposits are identified.
(19-23 representative omentum).  RS (M-23)
Further tissue:
(24-30 further sections of tumour with mesentery and serosal surface).  RS (M-30/EE/ank)
B.  "PELVIC PERITONEUM".  Multiple fragments of grey brown and fatty tissue, measuring in aggregate 30x30x20mm.  Some firmer areas are present ? adhesions ? tumour deposit.  
(1-3 representative tissue).  RS (M-3)
C.  "UMBILICUS".Two pieces of unorientated tissue with skin surface on each measuring in aggregate 40x40x20mm.  There is rough peritoneal surface attached with ? adhesion ? tumour deposit.  
(1-3 RS skin surface with underlying rough ? tumour).  RS (M-3)
D.  "LIVER LESION SEGMENT 8".  A piece of liver weighing 3g and measuring up to 25x20x15mm.  There is a capsular surface present with a pale nodule 5mm in maximal extent noted on the surface.  Margin inked black.On sectioning the nodule is 7mm from the nearest resection margin.  
(1&2 RS).  RS (2-2)
E.  "PERITONEAL NODULE".  A piece of fatty tissue measuring 20mm in maximal extent with some grey firm area 5mm and 2mm.AE (1-1/EE/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr P Passi)
A.  Sections show a high grade, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive mucinous and signet ring cell components.  Tumour infiltrates through the muscularis propria into pericolic tissue, although no peritoneal surface invasion is seen on multiple sections There is also an extensive foreign body type reaction involving the tumour within the pericolic tissues, as well as the sections of peritoneum, pelvic peritoneum, umbilicus, and peritoneal nodules.  These features are suggestive of a previous episode of gastrointestinal rupture, however, correlation with clinical features is required.  Asmall deposit of mucinous adenocarcinoma is seen on the mesenteric surface (Block A2), regarded as a metastasis.
Tumour type:  Adenocarcinoma 
Histologic grade:  High grade (poorly differentiated), with mucinous and signet ring cell components.
Depth of invasion:  T3 - Tumour invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissue
Peritoneal surfaceinvolvement:  not demonstrated
Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes: Low density(<5/hpf)
Excision Margins:  
Proximal:  Clear (>10mm)
Distal:  Clear (>10mm)
Lymph nodes:  
Number positive:  4
Total number:  12
Apical node:  Negative
Intramural vein invasion:  Not identified
Extramural vein invasion:  Present
Small vessel (lymphatic) invasion:  Present
Perineural invasion: present
Other findings: 
Polyps:  Areas of high grade dysplasia are seen adjacent to the invasive tumour.
Remote colon:  Diverticulum

Ancillary studies:  
Mismatch repair enzymes, Immunostains:  to follow
Microsatellite instability(MSI):  not tested
Synthesis/stage (AJCC/UICC TNM 7):  
TNM stage:   pT3, pN2, pM1
Sections of gallbladder show features of cholesterolosis and mild chronic cholecystitis.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the sections of gallbladder examined.  
Sections of peritoneum show a florid foreign body reaction to weakly birefringent foreign material.  There isno evidence of malignancy in the representative peritoneal tissue examined.  
Sections of omentum show no evidence of malignancy in the representative tissue examined.  A single small omental lymph node shows no involvement.
B.  Sections of peritoneum show a florid foreign body reaction.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the representative tissue examined.  
C.  Sections of umbilicus show skin and underlying adipose tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.  Focal area of foreign body reaction is noted. 
 
D.  Sections of liver show a circumscribed area of partially hyalinised fibrous tissue, adjacent to an area showing large numbers of dilated, thin walled blood vessels.  There is no atypia of the vascular endothelium, and the features are suggestive of a partially sclerosed haemangioma. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
E:Sections show a nodular area of foreign body reaction and chronic inflammation.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Immunostains for MSI proteins (Citigroup ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED HOSPITAL Lab; block: A4 )
MLH1: Positive (normal) staining of nuclei
PMS2: Positive (normal)staining of nuclei
MSH2: Positive (normal) staining of nuclei
MSH6: Positive (normal) staining of nuclei
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repairenzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
