CLINICAL:
Left chest wall sarcoma re-excision.  Sarcoma excision (chest wall).  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Chest, new medial margin sarcoma, sutures short superior, medium medial, long lateral" consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue with mesh orientated with sutures measuring 50mm (superior/inferior), 35mm (medial/lateral), 20mm (superficial/deep).  There are three sutures in place.  The superficial surface is inked blue, medial surface is inked red, lateral surface is inked black and deep surface is inked green.  Specimen has been sliced into 8 slices from superior to inferior.  The cut surface shows granulation tissue with mesh.  
Blocks:  1 to 2 - slice 1; 3 & 4 - slice 2; 5 & 6 - slice 3; 7 & 8 - slice 4; 9 & 10- slice 5; 11 & 12 - slice 6; 13 & 14 - slice 7; 15 to 18 - slice 8.  AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "New inferior medial margin sarcoma left chest, sutures short superior, medium medial, long lateral" consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue orientated with sutures measuring 40mm (superior/inferior), 20mm (medial/lateral), 30mm (superficial/deep).  There are three sutures in place.  There is a defect in the superior portion of the specimen running diagonally on both medial and lateral surface.  The superficialsurface is inked blue, medial surface is inked red, lateral surface is inked black and deep surface is inked green.  Specimen has been sliced into 7 slices from superior to inferior.  The cut surface shows uniform fibrofatty tissue.  Nofocal lesions seen.  Sliced 3 to 5 are fragmented due to the defect. 
Blocks:  1- slice 1; 2- slice 2; 3 - slice 3; 4 - slice 4; 5 - slice 5; 6 - slice 6; 7 & 8 - slice 8.  (TO: NO:  DT/mm 26.6.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by A/Prof L Heinsohn):
A. All of the tissue has been embedded and the sections show an organising excisioncavity bounded by extensive fat necrosis, granulation tissue and fibrosis.
Fragments of foreign material, consistent with surgical material is present and occasional small collections of mucoid material are seen.
A microscopic focus of residual chrondroid tissue, consistent residual chondrosarcoma, is seen in slice 7 (block A14). This focus measures approximately 0.2mm in maximum dimension and is circumferentially bounded by histiocytes within the zone of post surgical organisation and no viable tumour nuclei are seen within this focus.  This area is 1mm from the blue inked, superficial surface and is more than 10mm from the deep and medial margins. 
A second, similar 0.25mm focus of degenerative chrondoid tissue without viable nuclei is identified in the wall of the cavity in slice 8 (inferior end of specimen), at a distance of 3mm from the blue inked, superficial margin and 4mm from the red inked, medial margin. No viable tumour nuclei are seen in this second focus.
A third fragment of tumour is also seen in slice 8 and measures 0.5mm. This fragment contains one of two visible nuclei, but is sitting in a cleft of fibrous tissue and is possibly dislodged following previous surgery rather than infiltrative. The margin is fragmented in this section but this focus is approximately 1mm from the superficial surface and 1.5mm from the medial surface. Deeper levels have been examined.
Dr L Albair has also seen representative sections of this case and the original tumour (44L64796) and agrees with the above.
B. All of the tissue has been embedded and the sections show an organising zone of fat necrosis bounded by adipose tissue.
No diagnostic evidence of residual viable tumour is identified.
This result was discussed withProf L Readus, 30/6/2065.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A. CHEST WALL, NEW MEDIAL MARGIN: MICROSCOPIC FOCI OF RESIDUAL TUMOUR SEEN AROUND CAVITY, OF UNCERTAIN HISTOLOGICAL VIABILITY.
B. CHEST WALL, NEW INFERIOR MEDIAL MARGIN: NO EVIDENCE OF RESIDUAL TUMOUR IDENTIFIED
