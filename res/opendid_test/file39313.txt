SPECIMEN LENGTH: Terminal ileum 45mm, caecum ascending and part of transverse colon 135x60mm.  Appendix 50x6mm.  Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 70mm.

TUMOUR SITE:  Ascending colon

TUMOUR SIZE:  47x31mm

TUMOUR DESCRIPTION:  A broad-based polypoid tumour with raised edges and polypoid edge distally invading through the wall to involve the overlying serosa which is nodular and puckered in relation to tumour.

MACROSCOPIC TUMOUR PERFORATION: Not identified

TUMOUR LOCATION RELATED TO PERITONEAL REFLECTION: Entirely above the anterior peritoneal reflection.

MACROSCOPIC INTACTNESS OF MESORECTUM: N/A

MACROSCOPIC DISTANCE OF TUMOUR FROM MARGINS:
Proximal: 75mm
Distal: 60mm
Radia/mesenteric : More than 75mm

PERITONEUM:  Appears involved by direct spread

LYMPH NODES:   As per block legend

POLYPS:  Present.  A polyp is identified at the distal edge of the tumour 20x15x10mm and appears confined to the mucosa.

OTHER COMMENTS:   The appendix cut surface is unremarkable.

18 proximal and distal resection margins; 19 appendix TS base LS tip and body; 20&amp;amp;21 polyp distal to tumour all embedded; 22 apical lymph node bisected; 23 five lymph nodes; 24 four nodes; 25&amp;amp;26 each five lymph nodes; 27-29 tumour involving the overlying nodular serosa [28 is tumour block for tissue banking]).  RS (M-29/ZH 18/11/2066 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr X Inoue)

Specimen A:
The paraffin sections confirm smooth muscle that could represent subserosal leiomyoma and with focus of endometriosis.

Specimen B:
The paraffin sections confirm benign appearing smooth muscle tissue.

Specimen C:
The paraffin sections demonstrate fibrofatty tissue with endometriosis.

Specimen D:
The sections show fibrofatty tissue with endometriosis.

Specimen E:
The paraffin section shows fibrofatty tissue only.

Specimen E:
Sections of the first described fallopian tube and ovary demonstrate unremarkable appearing fallopian tube and ovary with haemorrhagic involuting follicular cysts and benign serous inclusions. The adjacent peritoneum is unremarkable.

Sections of the second described fallopian tube and ovary demonstrate unremarkable appearing fallopian tube and ovary with haemorrhagic corpus luteum and with benign serous inclusions.

Sections of the gallbladder show mild smooth muscle hyperplasia and prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff Sinuses. The serosal surfaces appear unremarkable.

Sections of the skin show fibroblastic reaction, birefringent foreign material consistent with scar.
Sections of the omentum show patchy fibroblastic reaction and several omental lymph nodes show reactive changes only.

Sections of the fragments of peritoneum show subsurface fibroblastic reaction.

Sections of the hemicolectomy specimen demonstrate moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in association with sessile tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. The carcinoma infiltrates through all layers of the bowel wall to reach the pericolic fat and with mucous separated from serosa by fibroblastic tissue.

20 lymph nodes were identified and show reactive changes only. Sections of the appendix and proximal and distal margins appear unremarkable. See also synoptic report below.

Supplementary report 29/11/69

Immunostains for MSI proteins (Molecular Oncology Unit NARROGIN HOSPITAL; block: F29)

MLH1:  Positive staining present
PMS2:  Positive staining present
MSH2:  Positive staining present
MSH6:  Positive staining present

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.

Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
