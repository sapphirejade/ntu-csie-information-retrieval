V shaped portion of colon with anastomotic line, portion of bowel 170mm in length anastomosed to other side 130mm in length, with a maximum diameter of 50mm.  Smaller portion of bwel appears close loop. Multiple adhesions attached to the serosal surface. Mucosa is intact.  Sectioning shows multiple mucinous areas in the mesentery and serosa.
(1&amp;amp;2 surgical margin; 3&amp;amp;4 composite section of the mucinous focus; 5-7 more area of mucinous foci and colon)

Separate piece of bowel also in the same jar measuring 70mm in length and 50mm in diameter.  Multiple adhesions at the serosa present.  Mucosa appears intact. There is a 7mm tan polyp in the middle of the specimen.
(8 polyp; 9&amp;amp;10 RS of the bowel)

Multiple fibrofatty tissue with thick mucinous areas measuring 80x80x40mm in aggregate.
(11&amp;amp;12 RS).  RS (M-12/SM 23/11/2071 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. F. Scheel)
There are deposits of low grade mucinous epithelium within large pools of extracellular mucin and surrounding fibrosis.  These are present within the mesentery of the bowel and adjacent to skeletal muscle (abdominal wall).  There are 3 lymph nodes not involved.  There are no high grade areas and no signet ring cells.
