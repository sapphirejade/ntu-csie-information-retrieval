CLINICAL:
Fibroid uterus.  Uterus, tubes, ovaries.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and ovary weighing 648g in total.  There is a detached ovary and fallopian tube.  The uterus measures 115 x 100 x 60mm and has asmooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, the endometrium is up to 2mm in thickness and the myometrium is up to 34mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains multiple fibroids ranging from 8 to 55mm in maximum dimension and there are multiple external adnexal fibroids, the largest measures 120 x 85 x 80mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 70 x 8 x 7mm and the right ovary measures 25 x 25 x 18mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The detached fallopian tube measures 50mm in length x 7 x 6mm in maximum diameter and the detached ovary measures 27 x 15 x 10mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative section.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - full LS of anterior bodyand cervix; 6 to 10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 - right fallopian tube; 12 - right ovary; 13 - separate fallopian tube; 14 - separate ovary; 15 - representative large fibroid.  (TO: DZ; AK/rt 17.8.65); 16 to 19 - right posterior cervix; 20 to 21 - left posterior cervix; 22 to 24 - right anterior cervix; 25 to 27 -left anterior cervix (cervix AE).  (TO: TA;RG/vo 18.8.65) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Layel/Dr Z Antonopoulos)
Sections of cervix show moderately differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma arising on a background of multifocal adenocarcinoma in situ. The adenocarcinoma is up to 15mm in length along the cervical canal and infiltrates up to 5.5mm thick. The adenocarcinoma is focally 0.5mm from the ectocervical and cervical soft tissue margin (block 21). No diagnostic lymphovascular invasion is identified. The adenocarcinoma is ER positive and shows diffuse strong nuclear p16 positivity. 
The cervical squamous epithelium shows focal HPV effect and CIN 1- 2. CIN appears clear of the ectocervical margins. There is a benign endocervical/ endometrial polyp. The endometrium appears weakly proliferative with focal tubal metaplasia. There are multiple leiomyomas, foci of adenomyosisand serosal endometriosis. The right ovary shows focal endosalpingiosis and benign simple cysts. The left shows no significant abnormality. The right and left fallopian tubes show focal squamous metaplasia and mild atypia, possibly reactive in nature. There is no evidence of tubal adenocarcinoma in situ. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Endocervical moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising on a backgroundof adenocarcinoma in situ.
Adenocarcinoma extends 15mm along the cervical canal, is up to 5.5mm thick and is focally 0.5mm from the ectocervical/soft tissue margin. 
Proliferative endometrium, leiomyomas, adenomyosis and serosal endometriosis.
