D.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy left lateral" consists of two cores 12 and 16mm in length.   AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy left base" consists of two cores 18 and 20mm.   AE 1 block.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy right apex" consists of two cores 10 and 11mm and two fragments measuring 2 and 4mm.   AE 1 block.
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy right mid" consists of two cores 14 and 15mm.   AE 1 block.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy right transition" consists of a 20mm core.   AE 1 block. 
I.  Specimen labelled "Prostate biopsy right lateral" consists of two cores 9 and 12mm and a 3mm fragment.   AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Lainhart):
A. Sections show adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8, involving 60% and 80% of 2 out of 2 cores. High grade PIN is also present. Perineural spread is seen.

B. Sections show adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8, involving 80% of 1 out of 2 cores. 
C. Sections show a core biopsy of prostate gland with no evidence of malignancy. 
D. Sections show adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8, involving 90% both cores. High grade PIN is also present. Perineural spread is seen.
E. Sections show adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8, involving 30% of 1 out of 2 cores.
F, G, H & I. Sections show core biopsies of prostate gland with no evidence of malignancy. 
J. Sections show adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6, involving 10% of 1 out of 2 cores.
