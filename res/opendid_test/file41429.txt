CLINICAL NOTES:  Re-excision of cavity (right breast) medial and inferior.

MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &quot;RE-EXCISION MARGINS INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR RIGHT BREAST&quot; &quot;Short - superior, Medium - medial, Long - lateral.&quot;
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Re-excision oriented
SPECIMEN X-RAY, HOOKWIRE:  No
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral: 40mm, Superior to inferior 70mm, Anterior to posterior:  37mm
WEIGHT 45g
SKIN NIPPLE MUSCLE:  No
MARGIN INKED:   Non-standard:  Anterior blue, posterior black, medial red and lateral (cavity surface) green.
DISSECTION: Cut from superior to inferior, 14 slices
FINDINGS / LESION:  There are haemorrhage, fibrosis and areas of possible fat necrosis towards the lateral edge (cavity).  No discrete lesions are identified.
(1 four LS slice 1 superior; 2-4 slice 2; 5-7 slice 4; 8-10 slice 6; 11-13 slice 8; 14-16 slice 10; 17 anterior slice 11; 18 anterior slice 12; 19-21 slice 13; 22 three LS slice 14 inferior).  RS (M-22/ZH ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  F Wnukowski

There is residual DCIS in slices 13 and 14 from the inferior end of the specimen. The DCIS is of similar appearance to previous.

(RESIDUAL) BREAST DCIS SYNOPTIC REPORT:

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
- DCIS size/extent:  8 mm, present in x2 adjacent 4 mm slices, near inferior end
- Nuclear grade: Intermediate nuclear grade
- Architecture/type:  cribriform, papillary
- Necrosis:  Not identified
- Calcification of DCIS: Absent

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):  Not identified

EXCISION MARGINS, DCIS:
- Close margin(s), see NOTE#
NOTE#:
Because of the growth pattern of DCIS in the ductal system, a negative but close margin does not ensure the absence of DCIS in the adjacent tissue.
- Distance of DCIS to margins:
Anterior:  >10 mm
Posterior: > 10 mm
Superior:  > 20 mm
Inferior: 1 mm (close margin), (section 22)
Medial, near inferior end: 0.5 mm (close margin <1 mm), section 20
Lateral:  not applicable (previous cavity surface)

SEPARATE FINDINGS:
Epithelial hyperplasia, intraductal papillomas, granulating previous biopsy cavity surface.

DIAGNOSIS:

RE-EXCISION MARGINS INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR RIGHT BREAST:
- area of residual ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate nuclear grade, towards inferior end of specimen;
- close margins.
