HISTORY:  
PMP.  Peritoneal disease.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEAL DISEASE".  Multiple pieces of grey fibrous tissue and mucinous tissue, measuring in aggregate 60x60x50mm.
(1-4 RS; 5&6 tumour reserve 1, tumour reserve 2).  RS (M-6/GO/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. T. Schrameck)
The fragments of peritoneal tissue show involvement by mucinous neoplasm with features in keeping with a low-grade mucinous neoplasm of most probable appendiceal origin. The tumour is characterised by irregular lakes of extracellular mucin, some of which are at least partially lined by a layer of minimally atypical mucinous epithelium. Elsewhere, the mucin is associated with histiocytic inflammation. There is no high-grade epithelium in the sections examined. The appearances are consistent with clinical description of pseudomyxoid peritonei. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS 
- INVOLVEMENT BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM WITH FEATURES OF PSEUDO MYXOID PERITONEI.
