***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: MYOGENIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Dr G Riff (21.10.2065)

CLINICAL:
?R thigh sarcoma.  ??Haematoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "R thigh" and consists of six core biopsy fragments measuring 2 to 8mm in length.   AE 1 block.   (RM/ta 3/10/65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Egner):
Sections show a high grade sarcoma.  The tumour is composed of undifferentiated round to spindle cells.  There isan admixture of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm in spindle, tadpole, and racquet-like contours.  Frequent mitoses are present.  There are focal areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The tumour cells are positive for Vimentin and Desmin.  There is focal non-specific staining for S100 and EMA.  The stains for SMA, MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin), HMB45 and Melan-A are negative.  The main differential diagnoses include pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma and dedifferentiated leiomyosarcoma.  Additional immunohistochemical stain (myogenin) is to follow and a supplementary report will be issued.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right thigh - High grade sarcoma (see text).
***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: MYOGENIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Dr G Newey (21.10.2065)
Immunohistochemical staining for myogenin is negative.
The overall morphology and patchy desmin positivity is most in keeping with a high grade pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma with patchy smooth muscle (myogenic) differentiation. The features are not diagnostic of rhabdomyosarcoma.
