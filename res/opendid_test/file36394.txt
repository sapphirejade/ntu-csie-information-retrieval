CLINICAL NOTES:
Abdominal wound CRC frozen section.  Please do peritonectomy for metastatic colorectal ca recurrence.  Rectum, ureter (left), small bowel resection, segment 7 liver, left pelvic side wall.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;ABDOMINAL WOUND&amp;quot;.  Two pieces of firm reddish tissue 8x7x4mm and 7x6x3mm.  One piece has clear sutures removed.  One TS of each piece taken on one chuck for frozen section.

F/S : &amp;quot;Dense fibrous tissue with suture material in one piece.  No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot;.  Reported to Mark (anaesthetist) by Dr. J. Baymon at 13:15Hrs on 30.8.66.

(1 FS; 2 larger piece serially sliced; 3 smaller piece serially sliced). AE (M-3)

B.  &amp;quot;RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received multiple tissue specimens including :

A segment of small bowel 70x35mm. The mesentery is attached up to 15mm. The serosal surface has a central firm white nodule (tumour deposit) measuring 18x15mm invading into the wall of the bowel but no mucosal involvement is identified.

(1 LS of each longitudinal resection margin; 2 TS serosal nodule)

An anterior resection specimen 125x40mm with mesocolon and mesorectum up to 40mm. The entire colon is covered by peritoneum.  The outer surface has multiple firm white nodules and extensive adhesions on its outer surface.  A tubular structure is identified on the left side of the specimen (? vas) 30x5mm.  The non peritonealised resection margins are inked black. The ureter overlying surface is inked blue.  Upon opening there is a polypoid lesional mucosa over 35x25mm located 24mm of proximal and 55mm of distal margin.  It is located more than 20mm of the radial margin.

(3 proximal vasc margin; 4 distal vas margin; 5 proximal bowel margin; 6 distal bowel margin; 7&amp;amp;8 lesional mucosal area with underlying section of ureter; 9&amp;amp;10 continuous polypoid area; 11&amp;amp;12 each one LS of lesional polypoid area [recurrent tumour]; 13 three TS mid vaswith adjacent serosal lesion; 14&amp;amp;15 RS serosal deposit proximal and distal specimen; 16&amp;amp;17 each four lymph nodes)

Received multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue, 90x70x30mm,  some of which are covered by peritoneum with multiple firm white tumour deposits and fat necrosis. The cut surface reveals up to four lymph nodes 10-36mm im maximum extent with total effacement by firm white tumour.

(18&amp;amp;19 RS of lymph nodes ( 1 TS of each) and peritoneal involvement). RS (M-19)

C.  &amp;quot;SEMINAL VESICLE&amp;quot;.  A piece of tissue consistent with seminal vesicle 35x20x15mm. The outer surface is inked blue.  Reveals multiple tubules with no discrete lesion.  Serially sliced.  AE (M-3)

D.  &amp;quot;LIVER SEGMENT 7&amp;quot;. A segmental liver resection, 14g consists of disrupted capsular surface 30x30mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 20mm.  The margins are inked blue.  Serial slicing reveals a single firm white lesion 27x20x16mm involving the disrupted overlying capsule and abutting the surgical resection margins macroscopically.

(1 LS of each peripheral resection margin; 2 normal liver away from lesion; 3&amp;amp;4 lesion abutting the margins with block 4 tumour block for tissue banking).  RS (M-4)

E.  &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SIDE WALL&amp;quot;.  Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue with covering peritoneum 45x30x20mm.  The serosal surfaces are involved by firm white tumour deposits.  A longitudinal tubular structure is identified 40x5 mm with unremarkable cut surface.

(1&amp;amp;2 RS).  RS (M-2/ZH 6/5/2070 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr J Aholt)
A.   Histology shows pieces of dense fibrous scar tissue with a foreign body giant cell granulomatous reaction to refractile suture material.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Histology shows widespread infiltration by moderately to poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma which infiltrates widely throughout the wall of the segment of rectum in a transmural fashion focally involving the mucosa and extending widely throughout submucosa, muscularis propria and pericolic fat.  Multiple foci of lymphatic vascular invasion are seen throughout the wall of the rectum with deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma within 9 of 12 pericolic lymph nodes with extranodal extension of 3mm.  A focus of perineural infiltration is also seen in pericolic fat.  In the pericolic fatty tissue there is infiltration of vas deferens which extends to reach the local resection margin.  There is also infiltration into the wall of a segment of small bowel, where carcinoma infiltrates through muscularis propria just into submucosa.  There is patchy tumour necrosis throughout the deposits of malignancy.

C.  Histology shows relatively widespread infiltration of seminal vesicle by moderately to poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma with widespread foci of lymphatic vascular invasion.  Carcinoma lies at the resection margin.

D.  Histology shows a deposit of moderately differentiated metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with widespread central necrosis.  Carcinoma focally extends to reach the local diathermied resection margin.

E.  Histology shows an extensively necrotic deposit of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma within fibrofatty soft tissue adjacent to some vessels.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  ABDOMINAL WOUND -  SCAR TISSUE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
B.  RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE -
- WIDESPREAD INVOLVEMENT BY MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA WITH METASTATIC DISEASE IN 9 OF 12 PERICOLIC LYMPH  NODES AND INVOLVEMENT OF VAS DEFERENS
C.  SEMINAL VESICLE -  INVOLVED BY COLORECTAL  ADENOCARCINOMA
D.  LIVER SEGMENT 7 -  METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA
E.  LEFT PELVIC SIDE WALL -  METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA
