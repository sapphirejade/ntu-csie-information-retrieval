Vulva cancer.  IHD, DVT, hypothyroid, arthritis, anaemia, asthma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Anterior vulva, long stitch 12 o&amp;apos;clock, short stitch urethra&amp;quot;, consists of
an oriented triangular shaped piece of mucosa containing the distal urethra, with two orientating sutures (long denoting 12 o&amp;apos;clock, short denoting urethra (6 o&amp;apos;clock)). The specimen measures 58mm from 12 to 6 o&amp;apos;clock by up to 72mm from 3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock to a depth of up to 17mm.  In the
6 o&amp;apos;clock half of the specimen there is a roughened area on the mucosal surface, measuring 53 x 23mm.  This roughened area is 1mm to the mucosal margin in the 4 o&amp;apos;clock aspect, and 2mm to the margin in the 3 o&amp;apos;clock aspect.  The 10 to 12 o&amp;apos;clock region of the specimen on the mucosa is covered in blue dye. The urethral orifice measures 4 x 1mm. The 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin is inked blue,
9 o&amp;apos;clock margin inked black, and the urethral orifice on the deep aspect is inked red.
Block 1 - LS 12 o&amp;apos;clock pole; 2-13 - mid TS from 12-6 o&amp;apos;clock direction (3 and 4 composite sections; 5 and 6 composite sections; 7 and 8 composite sections; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - composite sections; 11 to 13 composite sections); 14-22 - serially embedded 6 o&amp;apos;clock margin from 3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock direction (slice 18 with urethra); please refer to blocking diagram.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right inguinal lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fat 29 x 22 x 13mm.  The specimen contains one lymph node, which is focally haemorrhagic on the cut surface.  Specimen serially sectioned and embedded across blocks 1-3.  AE.  (TO:EX/ec 23/8/69)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Bludworth):
A.  Sections show two separate foci of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising in a background of extensive HSIL / VIN 3.   One focus has a width of 14mm, a length of 12mm and a depth of 2.2mm.  This is clear of the deep margin by 3mm.  The other focus has a width of 13mm, a length of 12mm and a depth of 2mm.   This is clear of the deep margin by 9mm.
Squamous cell carcinoma is clear of the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin by 4mm, the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin by 10mm, the 6 o&amp;apos;clock margin by 2mm, and is well clear of the 12 o&amp;apos;clock margin.
The urethra is clear of dysplasia and carcinoma.  No convincing lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The margins are clear of HSIL.

B.  The single lymph node shows a 10mm deposit of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, clear of margins (see above for measurements).  One right inguinal lymph node shows metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
