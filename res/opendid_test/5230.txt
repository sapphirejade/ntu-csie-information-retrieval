Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Ca125 increased.  AF, thrombotic stroke.  Ovarian mass - poorly diff adeno.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a lobulated mass with some adherent fat and a smooth surface measuring 90 x 90 x 70mm.  There is a possible fallopian tube, 50 x 10mm in diameter.  The cut surface has a solid grey/pink appearance with small areas of necrosis.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section deblocked; 3 to 14 - representative ovary; 15- ?fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  
Phone result to Dr Johnny Hudlin by Dr T Falwell/T Sauls at 10.04am on 03.06.66.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of an adherent fallopian tube to ovary measuring in total, 40 x 30 x 15mm.  The fallopian tube measures 45mm in length x 8 x 8mm in diameter.  There is adherent fibrofatty tissue to the ovarian mass.  On sectioning the ovary has an unremarkable appearance.  Representative sections in 5 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 460 x 100 x 15mm.  No discrete lesion is identifiedon sectioning.  Representative in 3 blocks.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon epiploica" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with a firm mass embedded within the middle measuring 40 x 25 x 10mm.  The mass measures 15 x 10 x 10mm and has a firm cream cut surface.  Representative sections in 1 block.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a sheet of grey membranous tissue 80 x 40 x 3mm.  One surface is smooth and greyand the opposite surface is ragged with attached fibrofatty tissue.  On the smooth surface there are multiple firm cream nodules measuring from 1 to 10mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections in1 block.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Vaginal cusp (?sic cuff)" consists of two pieces of ragged haemorrhagic membranous tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 5mm and 30 x 15 x 10mm.  Both pieces of tissue are haemorrhagicand both contain areas of firm nodule material ranging from 1 to 50mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1- representative larger piece; 2- representative smaller fragments.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right uterosacral nodule" consists of a ragged piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm containing a smooth cream mass 50mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections in 1 block.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 70 x 30 x 15mm containing lymph nodes ranging from 8 to 40mm in maximum dimension.  The largest lymph node appears replaced by tumour.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1 - representative largest replaced lymph node; 2- one lymph node bisected; 3- one lymph node seriallysectioned; 4 - lymph nodes as seen.  
I.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator nodes" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 30 x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes ranging from 3 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.
J.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm.  Six lymph nodes ranging from 2 to 28mm in maximum dimension.  The largest lymph node appears replaced by tumour.  The lymph nodes are AE.
Blocks:  1- representative replaced lymph node; 2- one lymph node serially sectioned; 3- lymph nodes as seen.  
K.  Specimen labelled "Descendingcolon nodule" consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40, 30 and 25mm in maximum dimension.  Each containing a firm cream mass.  Representative from each in 3 blocks.  
L.  Specimen labelled "Caecal nodule" consists of a haemorrhagic nodule 5 x 5 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block.
M.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon nodule B" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 55 x 30 x 20mm.  There is a large deposit of firm cream tumour measuring 38mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections in 1 block.  
N.  Specimen labelled "Paraaortic node" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue 15mm each containing lymph nodes ranging from 8 to 10mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1block.
O.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a segment of small bowel, 90 x 20 x 20mm with surrounding fibrofatty tissue.  There is a deposit of firm cream tumour on the antimesenteric serosal surface measuring 40mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour is 10mm from one surgical margin inked blue and approximately 35mm from the opposite surgical margin.  The tumour does not involve the mucosal surface of the small bowel.  Representative sections.  
Blocks:  1- blue surgical margin and tumour; 2- black surgical margin; 3 & 4 - paired blocks full face through area of deepest invasion and bowel. 
(TO: QL:  TM/mm 3.7.66) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr T Dellarocco):
A. Sections are of a (poorly differentiated) high grade serous carcinomaof the ovary. 
The fallopian tube is unremarkable.
B. The left ovary and tube show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections are of fibroadipose tissue with occasional small vessels. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D, E, F, G, K, L, M. Sections show deposits of high grade serous carcinoma. 
H. One of four lymph nodes shows metatstatic carcinoma.  No definite extracapsular spread is seen. 
I. Sections show five lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
J. One of six lymph nodes shows metastatic carcinoma.  No definite extracapsular spread is seen. 
N. One of two lymph nodes shows metastatic carcinoma.  No definite extracapsular spread is seen.
O. Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving the serosa and muscularis propria of the small bowel.  The tumour is clear of the surgical margins.  
 
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of the right ovary with involvement of the descending colon, bladder peritoneum, vaginal cuff, right uterosacrum, caecum and small bowel.  
Three of seventeen (3 of 17) lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.
