CLINICAL:
Complex cystleft lateral section liver.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left lateral liver resection", consists of a lobe of liver measuring 125 x 85 x 50mm.  The surgical margin is inked black.  The capsular surface of the liver has areas of subcapsular haemorrhagemeasuring from 2 to 20mm in size.  There is an area of dimpling on the surface corresponding with an underlying cyst-like structure measuring 25 x 15 x 25mm.  The interior surface of the cyst appears smooth and the cyst is multiloculated.  On slicing the cut surface of the liver appears unremarkable with no macroscopic evidence of cirrhosis.  
Blocks: 1 - cyst wall; 2 - cyst wall; 3 - cyst wall; 4 and5- paired sections cyst wall and margin; 6 and 7 - paired sections cyst wall and margin; 8 and 9 - paired sections cyst wall and margin; 10 and 11 - paired sections cyst wall and margin; 12 - cyst wall; 15 - cyst wall; 16 - liver away from cyst.  
Comment:  All of the cyst has been embedded.  (TO: BE;NO/vo 20.3.66) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Wilging):
Sections of the liver show a 25 mm multiloculated cyst lined by a single-layer of benign cuboidal to columnar epithelium. The epithelium shows positive staining for CK7 and CK19, consistent with bile duct origin. CK20, calretinin, CK5/6 and WT-1 are negative. Branched bile ducts reminiscent of a bile duct hamartoma are focally present at the periphery of the lesion. There is no evidence of malignancy.
The lesion is > 15mmfrom the margin.
The adjacent liver shows mild macrovesicular steatosis.


COMMENT
The findings are of a benign bile duct lesion. The multilocular nature of the cyst and the presence of focal branch glands would favour a cystic bile duct hamartoma (Martin et al. JMRI, 2010 Apr;31(4):903-11).
DIAGNOSIS
Left lateral liver: benign bile duct lesion, favour cystic bile duct hamartoma
