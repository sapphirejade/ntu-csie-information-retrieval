Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass.  20kg weight loss.  Smoker.  Ca125 = >100.  Appendicectomy.  Tubal ligation and reversal (tube stented).  Anxiety/depression.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic mass" consists of a part of cyst wall which appears to be uniloculated 10 x 15mm with a thickness of 2 to 3mm.  Two representative sections for frozen section 1 and 2.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 - residual of the frozen section.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma, favour endometrioid carcinoma.
Result to Anaesthetist fellow/Prof Orville by Dr P Haaz at 10:45am on 11.11.2065.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and right tube and ovary weighing 89g in total.  The uterus measures 42 x 75 x 15mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 17mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm long and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 10mm.  There is no obvious tumour within the endometrial cavity.  On serial sectioning there is no tumour or lesion within the myometrium.  Sectioning of the right ovary reveals three cystic areas ranging from 5 to 7mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - posterior body and cervix; 7 - right fimbriae; 8 - right fallopian tube; 9 - right fallopian tube (fallopian tube AE); 10 to 12 - right ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a partly disrupted and partially opened ovary (90 x 70 x 35mm) with an attached fallopian tube, 75mm long and 10mm in diameter.  The fimbrial end is disrupted and haemorrhagic which is adherent to the ovarian haemorrhagic area.  On serial sectioning of the ovarian mass it shows solid cystic cut surface.  Most of the cyst is thin walled and contain brownish mucoid like material, ranging from 5 x 5 x 5mm to 25 x 20mm.  The walls are up to 1mm in maximum thickness.  However, centrally there is an irregular cystic lesion with thick fibrous wall and focal solidarea, 35 x 20 x 80mm.  The wall is 2 to 5mm thick.  Some of the solid areas appear to be necrotic and calcified..
Blocks:  1 to 8 - representative sections of the mass (1 - fallopian tube adherent to the mass); 9 - fallopian tube.
D.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas nodule" consists of two irregular fibrous tissue, 25 x 20 x 10mm and 20 x 15 x 10mm.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a fatty tissue, 35 x 15 x 5mm.  Four possible nodes identified, 5 to 13mm.
Blocks:  1 - twonodes; 2 - one node; 3 - one node bisected.
F.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid biopsy" consists of three dark tan tissue fragment measuring 5 x 3 x 2mm to 10 x 5 x 2mm.  AE.
Blocks:  1 - the largest fragment bisected; 2 & 3 - two other fragments.
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a omental fatty tissue, 250 x 50 x 10mm.  There are ten nodules within the omental fat ranging from 2 x 2 x 2mm to 20 x20 x 2mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections of the nodule.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Toepel):
A & C.  Sections show a mixed clear cell carcinoma (80%) and well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (20%) of the left ovary.  A small amount of clear cell carcinoma is present in the paradnexal soft tissues.  The tube is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show deposits of clear cell carcinoma on the endocervical serosa, the uterine serosa, on the surface of the right ovary and in the right ovary.  
Otherwise the ectocervix, endocervix, endometrium and myometrium are unremarkable.  The right tube shows foci of endometriosis.
D, F & G.  Sections show deposits of clear cell carcinoma.
E.  One of four (1 of 4) lymph nodes shows a tiny (0.1mm) deposit of clear cell carcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
Mixed clear cell carcinoma (80%) and well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (20%) of the left ovary.  Metastatic clear cell carcinoma involves the right ovary, the uterine serosa, the Pouch of Douglas, the sigmoid and the omentum.
One of four (1 of 4) left external iliac lymph nodes shows metastatic clear cell carcinoma (0.1mm deposit).
   
ADDITIONAL REPORT 20/11/65:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
