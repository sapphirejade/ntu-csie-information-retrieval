CLINICAL:
?volar wrist.  Ganglion.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right wrist ganglion", consists of two fragments of pale white tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 3mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block. (TO: PB;MK/vo 12.4.66) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr E Showalter)
Sections show a fragment of fibrocartilage with overlying synovium that shows mild papillary synovial hyperplasia. The fibrocartilage shows patchy mild myxoid type degenerative change and very occasional focal, small degenerative cyst-like spaces are seen. There is no significant inflammation or evidence ofcrystal deposition. No granulomas or pathogenic organisms are identified with routine staining. There is no evidence of malignancy.

COMMENT:
The fibrocartilageshows patchy very mild degenerative type myxoid change and early cyst formation. In the appropriate clinical setting, the features raise the possibility of an early ganglion. 
Please correlate with clinical, imaging and intra-operative findings. 

DIAGNOSIS:
Tissue, right wrist: Suggestive of a ganglion (see comment).
