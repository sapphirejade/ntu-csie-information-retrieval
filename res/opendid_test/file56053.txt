CLINICAL NOTES:
67 female (please note that discrepancy between the label and the clinical note in regards to gender). Hx of colon AdenoCa 2070 - R hemicolectomy for T4 tumour. Now laparotomy - PCI
- Omentum.
- R hemicolectomy redo.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OMENTUM REDO RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY&amp;quot;. Consists of omentum and a segment of large bowel consistent with right colon. Also noted within the specimen jar is a piece of fatty tissue with one glistening surface ?peritoneum.

The omental tissue measures 400x180x28mm. It feels firm on palpation. Focally, on sectioning through this area it shows tumour with a tan appearance. There are scattered areas with pale firm appearance consistent with tumour away from the focal lesion. Representative sections taken.

(1-3 omentum involved by tumour [2 tumour block]).

Right hemicolectomy comprises of segment of small bowel and large bowel with an end to end anastomosis. It measures 390mm (small bowel 195mm; large bowel 195mm). There is adherent omental tissue at the site of anastomosis with a segment of bowel looping and adherent to this area as well. The remainder of the serosa shows multiple areas of serosal roughening ?adhesions. Proximal margin is inked blue, distal margin is inked black. There are multiple tumour deposits within the attached omentum, mesocolic fat. On opening the mucosa shows some granularity adjacent to the anastomotic site. Remainder of the mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.

(4 margins; 5 roughened serosa ?tumour involvement small bowel; 6 area of anastomosis; 7 area of anastomosis with adherent omentum involved by tumour; 8 and 9 mesocolic fat involved by tumour).

Separate piece of fatty tissue with glistening surface measures 135x70x10mm. On the glistening surface there is a firm area with possible tumour involvement.

(10 sections with possible tumour involvement). RS (M-10/MC 24/10/2070 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. I. Llewlyn)
Sections show deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary involving omentum, mesocolic fat and serosa of small and large bowel and separately submitted peritoneal fragments.

The surgical margins of the small and large bowel are clear of tumour.
No lymph nodes are identified. No focal mucosal abnormalities are present.

DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM REDO RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY
- RECURRENT MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SEROSAL, MESOCOLIC AND OMENTAL DEPOSITS.
