SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (18.9.65):
CLINICAL:
Nil provided.
Further info:  Necrotic cervical tumour.  Outside bx diagnosis:  malignant melanoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 101g intotal.  The uterus measures 80 x 43 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 42mm across and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm and the myometrium is 17mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains multiple white whorled nodules up to 10mm in maximum dimension.  There is a cuff of vaginal mucosa up to 20mm in length.  On sectioning the anterior cervix is expanded by a soft smooth tumour 25 x 19 x 35mm.  The cut surface of the tumour is homogenous and white,and it appears clear of the mucosal margins. 
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS posteriorbody and cervix; 9 to 31 - anterior cervix embedded sequentially from right to left; 32 to 41 - posterior cervix embedded sequentially from left to right; 42 to 44 - left parametrium; 45 - one possible lymph node right parametrium; 46 & 47 - right parametrium.   (TO:KM; HT/ta 10/9/65) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube" consists of a fallopian tube 51mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The serosa is smooth and there is no abnormality on sectioning.
Blocks:  1 - representative fallopian tube.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube" consists of a fallopian tube 45mm in length and 4mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth and there is no abnormality on sectioning.
Blocks:  1 - representative fallopian tube.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right parametrial lymph node" consists of a lymph node 15mm in maximum dimension.  TAE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 30 x 15 x 5mm, containing a 9mm lymph node.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right proximal obturator lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 20 x 10 x 5mm plus some blood clot.  No definite lymph node is seen macroscopically.  AE 3 blocks.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right proximal common iliac lymph node" consists of a 18mm lymph node.  Fat trimmed.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node
H.  Specimen labelled "Left proximal common iliac lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 30x 15 x 8mm, containing two lymph nodes measuring 23mm and 10mm.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node.
I.  Specimen labelled "Left proximal obturator lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 25 x 15 x 6mm containing four small lymph nodes.
Blocks:  1 - four lymph nodes.
J.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 20 x 15 x 5mm containing five small lymph nodes.
Blocks:  1 - three lymph nodes; 2 - two lymph nodes.  (TO: VW; FA/rt 10.9.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Spingola):
A.  Sections show malignant melanoma involving the vagina, ectocervix and endocervix.  An extensive in situ component is seen within the vagina suggesting that the vagina is the primary.
The tumour is composedpredominantly of small epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli.
The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 17mm through a wall 18mm thick within the cervix and a maximum depth of invasion of 5mm through a wall 5.2mm thick in the vagina.  The tumour has a maximum length of approximately 37mm.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The anterior and posterior vaginal margins are positive for in situ and invasive melanoma.
(A large panel of immunoperoxidase stains have already been performed on the previous cervical biopsy from MED/SURGERY WARD 33OA02215.  The tumour was strongly positive for HMB45, SOX10, S100 and MelanA).
The endometrium is benign.  The myometrium shows several leiomyomas.  One negative lymph node is noted in the right parametrium.  
B & C.  The tubes are unremarkable.
D.  One lymph node shows tiny deposits (up to 0.2mm) and single cells of metastatic malignant melanoma.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
G.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
H.  One of two lymph nodes shows tiny deposits (up to 0.6mm) and single cells of metastatic malignant melanoma.
I.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
J.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive malignant melanoma involving the vagina, ectocervix and endocervix (see above resize).  Positive vaginal margins.  Two of sixteen (2 of 16) lymph nodes show metastatic malignant melanoma.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (18.9.65):
This case was discussed at the Gynae Oncology Tumour Board on 15.9.65.  A request was made for the tumour to have BRAF testing.  This is already being done on the previous cervical biopsy specimen, reported at ACT Pathology, as indicated on their biopsy report.
