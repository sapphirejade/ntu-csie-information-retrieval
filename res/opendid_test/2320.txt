CLINICAL:
Right breast cancer re-excision.  Right breast removal of implant.  Right axillary dissection.  Left axillary dissection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Excision of implant stitch on deep margin" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring in total 100 x 70 x 40mm.  The deep margin has a suture andconsists of a disc of fibrofatty tissue with granulation tissue measuring 35 x 30mm in diameter.  Attached to this disc is a fibrous capsule (previous implant) filled with clear stringy material.  No other sutures are given to orientate the specimen.  There is fibrous tissue and adipose tissue adherent to the external capsule surface.  The internal capsule surface appears smooth.  The deep margin is inked black and the rest inked blue.  
Blocks: 1 to 11 - deep margin AE; 12 & 13 - superficial surface of capsule;14 to 16 - representative sections of capsule.    
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 1 & 2 lymph node dissection" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 90 x 60 x 50mm in maximum dimension containing lymph nodes ranging from 2 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  Two lymph nodes appear to be replaced by a tumour. There is also an area of fibrosis with a haemorrhagic centre which could represent a previous site of surgery. 
Blocks: 1 - involved node; 2 - involved node; 3 - one lymph node bisected; 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 5 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 6 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 7 & 8 - lymph nodes as seen; 9 to 12 - representative sections through previous surgical site (9 - includes lymph node close to cavity).  
C.  Specimen labelled "Level 2 lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20mm in maximumdimension containing two lymph nodes measuring 2 and 3mm each.  Lymph nodes are AE.
Block: 1 - lymph nodes.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary dissection" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 95 x 80 x45mm containing lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 25mm in maximum dimension. There is an area of fibrotic tissue within the fat. No mass lesions are found within this area. 
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 to 6 - lymph nodes as seen; 7 - representative fibrous tissue.   (TO:YS.KE/(ta) 21/3/65)  
 

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Brittin):
A. Sections show breast tissue with a fibrous capsule in the superficial aspect and granulation tissue from the surgical cavity in the deep aspect.  
There are 6 residual deposits of invasive ductal carcinoma (with focal micropapillary features), ranging from 1mm to 15mm in size, over a 19mm area, adjacent to the surgical cavity.
The lesion involves the new deep margin over an 11mm front (blocks 1 to 3).
Multiple vacuoles with a foreign body giant cell response are seen in block 16. 
B. Sections show metastatic carcinoma, up to 10mm in size in 7 out of 13 lymph nodes. Extranodal spread up to 2mm into fat over a 5mm front, is seen in 2 of the involved nodes. In block B5, tumour is seen at a diathermied margin over 0.4mm front.
C. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
D. Sections show 12 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Right breast excision of implant and re-excision: 6 deposits of invasive ductal carcinoma up to 15mm in size, over a 19mm area, positive new deep margin.
B. Levels 1 and 2 lymph node dissection: metastatic carcinoma in 7 out of 13 lymph nodes, extranodal spread present
C. Level 2 lymph nodes: 2lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
D. Left axillary dissection: 12 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
