SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.1.65):


CLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma on curettings.  CT suggests multiple pulmonary metastases.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tube + bilateral ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 95g.  The uterus measures 87 x 55 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix is 35 x 34mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning a polypoid lesion is present on the anterior and posterior endometrium of the body and fundus.  It measures 35 x 22mm.  Further sections show the tumour is invading to a depth of 2mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 13mm.  There is a cervical polyp identified which measures 10 x 5 x 5mm.  A leiomyoma 5mm diameter is identified in the myometrium.  The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  The right ovary is 25 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  A nodule is attached to the right ovary measuring 7 x 5 x 5mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  There are clips attached to the proximal ends of both fallopian tube.  The left ovary is 22 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 - 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 - representative section of tumour with possible deepest invasion of the anterior portion; 6 - representative section of leiomyoma; 7 to 10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 - representative section of tumour with deepest invasion of the posterior portion; 12 - friable tumour; 13 - cervical polyp; 14 - representative section of right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 15 and16 - right ovary (15 contains the nodule attached to the right ovary); 17 - representative section of left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 18 and 19 - left ovary.  (TO: Kilts;Theiler/vo 3.12.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Mackaman):
Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.There is some squamous and mucinous differentiation.  There is myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 5mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 11mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion.  A leiomyoma isconfirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  The described endocervical polyp is benign but has a focus of endometrioid adenocarcinoma on its surface; there is no stromal invasion of the cervix.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  
Sections of the fallopian tubes and right ovary are unremarkable.  The described nodule attached to the rightovary is a paraovarian cyst.  A section of the left ovary showsa focus of metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma on the serosal surface and invading underlying cortical stroma.  The ovary is otherwise unremarkable.


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium invading myometrium, 5mm out of 11mm total thickness.  Lymphovascular invasion and involvement of surface of endocervical polyp.  Metastasis to left ovary. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (25.1.65):
A stain for oestrogen receptors has been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.
Percentage of cells staining positive:   95%
Predominant intensity of staining:   Strong.
