CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritonectomy 19/4/66 for mucinous adenoCa - Appendix.
Laparotomy for small bowel. Bleeding today.
Frozen section - small bowel specimen.
Previous peritonectomy 7/68.
Histo:
- SB resection
- Abdo wall mass (wound)
- (---illegible) ileostomy.
- Peritoneal nodule.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;. Consists of specimen, measuring 120x60x50mm, comprising an about 160mm length of small bowel with adhesions around firm mesenteric thickening. Mesentery sampled for F/S.

F/S: &amp;quot;Florid fat necrosis, inflammation and immature scar tissue. No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot; per phone to registrar at 2:20pm on 16/10/70 by Dr. Y. Cocking.

At the surface of the mesentery, adhesions inked green. One of stapled margin and one end identified at the surgical margin. The other end is already cut, probably during the frozen.

(1 frozen section; 2 margin; 3-5 one full face of the small bowel and adhesion; 6-11 another full face). RS (M-11)

B. &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;. Multiple pieces of small bowel, measuring 320mm in length in aggregate. Mucosa appears ulcerated, oedematous and dusky. No tumour deposits are identified over the serosa. One of the pieces has a round opening surface, probably stoma, 25mm in diameter. Representative section embedded.

(1-6 section of small bowel ?ischaemic; 7-8 one composite section of the ?stoma). RS (M-8)

C. &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;. Multiple fibrofatty tissues, measuring 6x5x4mm in aggregate. AE (4-1)

D. &amp;quot;WOUND&amp;quot;. Consists of fibrofatty tissue, 25x20x15mm. Outer surface is inked blue. Serially sliced. Sectioning shows fibrotic granulation tissue surface. All tissue embedded, Blocks 1&amp;amp;2. AE (4-2/SM 15/7/2070 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Y Lammi)
A.  Histology shows small bowel with extensive widespread fat necrosis within the mesentery throughout much of the specimen. Scattered amongst the fat necrosis and organising fibrous tissue are relatively small foci of metastatic poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features.  Focally some deposits of acellular mucin lie on the mesenteric resection margin.  The small bowel mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  There is some adherent skeletal muscle adjacent to the fibrous scar tissue but is not infiltrated by malignancy.

B.  Histology shows multiple pieces of small bowel several of which have areas of flat mucosal ulceration. The adjacent mucosa shows oedema and haemorrhage within the lamina propria with broadening of the villi with mild non specific chronic inflammation.  Elsewhere there is evidence of fibrous serosal adhesions with fat necrosis and scattered small foci of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.  Small deposits of mucinous adenocarcinoma are seen within the section taken from the presumed stoma lying within ares of fat necrosis between anastomosis between the skin and the small bowel.

C.  Histology shows small pieces of fibrofatty tissue which contain multiple small deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.

D.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue which contain relatively large widespread deposits of metastatic  poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of signet ring cells.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  SMALL BOWEL -
-FOCAL DEPOSITS OF METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS.
B.  SMALL BOWEL -
-FOCAL SEROSAL DEPOSITS OF METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS.
C.  PERITONEAL NODULE -
-METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS.
D.  WOUND -
-METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS.
