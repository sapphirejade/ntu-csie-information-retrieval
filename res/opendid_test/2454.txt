CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Obesity.  T2DM.  Endometrial cancer.  Bladder cancer, low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries weighing230g in total.  The uterus measures 143 x 65 x 60mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 23mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning,the endometrium has thickened, papillary appearance, ?tumour.  The endometrium measures 11mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium measures 25mm in maximum thickness.  There is a subserosal fibroid extending from the fundal region ofthe uterus measuring 42 x 46 x 45mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 52mm in length with a diameter of 9mm.  The right ovary measures 40 x 24 x 20mm and has a patchy grey tan and yellow cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures57mm in length with a diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary has a nodular and cystic appearance and measures 48 x 28 x 31mm.  The cystic regions are filled with yellow fluid.  The remaining left ovarian parenchyma has a patchy grey and yellowcut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 8 - midline LS anterior uterus and cervix (blocks 4/5 and 6/7 composite slices; 8 - includes portion of fundal fibroid); 9 and 10 - LS anterior uterus; 11 and 12 - LS anterior uterus; 13 and 14 - LS anterior uterus; 15 - fundal fibroid; 16 to 21 -midline LS posterior uterus and cervix (21 and 20 include portion of fundal fibroid); 22 and 23 - LS posterior uterus; 24; - posteriolateral region of fundal fibroid; 25 - representative right fallopian tube; 26 and 27 - representative right ovary; 28 - representative left fallopian tube; 29 to 32 - representative left ovary.
B.  Specimenlabelled "Right vulval lesion", consists of a roughly oval piece of skin measuring 70 x 50 to a depth of 4mm.  There is a skin coloured nodule measuring 5 x 3mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  The lesions measures a height of 3mm.AE 2 blocks. 
Blocks: 1 - TS shave ends; 2 - mid TS.  (TO: WL;NH/vo 28.5.65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Ruckdeschel):
A.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  Most of the tumour is confined to the endometrium.  There is a focus of probablemyometrial invasion measuring less than 1mm in depth through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable. Areas of complex hyperplasia are also present in the endometrium.  The myometrium shows a benign adenomatoid tumour and focal adenomyosis.  Both tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show a benign intradermal nevus.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  One probable focus of early myometrial invasion, <1mm in depth through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins have already been performed on the previous curettings.
