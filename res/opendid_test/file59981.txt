CLINICAL NOTES:
G1 endometrial adeno Ca.

1.  Peritoneal washings for Cyto.
2.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries.
3.  Right pelvic sentinel node.
4.  Left pelvic sentinel node.
5.  Omental biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;.  Consists of uterus and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen weighing 55g in total.  The uterus measures 60x22x30mm.  The cervix 29mm from left to right with a 5mm slit-like os. The specimen has been previously partially opened in the coronal plane.  The right fallopian tube measures 50x5mm.  The right ovary 25x15mm.  The left fallopian tube 50x5mm with a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  The left ovary 25x12x6mm.  The coronal section is continued and the specimen is bivalved and hinged at the fundus.  The cut surface reveals a papilliform endometrial cavity up to 10mm in thickness with myometrium up to 7mm in thickness.  Photograph and block diagram created.

(1  right parametrial shave; 2  left parametrial shave; 3  right fallopian tube and ovary; 4  right fimbrial end all embedded; 5  left fallopian tube and ovary; 6  left fimbrial end all embedded with parafimbrial/paratubal cyst; 7-12  a whole midline sagittal slice [7-9  anterior aspect, 10-12  posterior aspect]; 13  coronal section of endometrium to left cornu; 14  coronal section of endometrium to right cornu).  Representative sections.  (M-14).

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of two lymph nodes, the larger 6x3x3mm.  The smaller possible lymph node 3mm.

(1  bisected larger node; 2  smaller node embedded whole). Lymph nodes all embedded (3-2)

C.  &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of fibrofatty tissue 30x10x5mm, contains two lymph nodes.  The larger 10x5x3, the smaller 7x5x2mm.

(1  larger lymph node bisected; 2  second lymph node embedded whole).  Lymph nodes all embedded.  (M-2).

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue, 16x7x5mm.  Bisected.  Both halves embedded block 1.  All embedded.  (2-1/MY 11/6/2070 km).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:

Immunostains for MMR proteins (block: A10)

MLH1: normal (positive staining)
PMS2: normal (positive staining)
MSH2: normal (positive staining)
MSH6: normal (positive staining)

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.

Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
