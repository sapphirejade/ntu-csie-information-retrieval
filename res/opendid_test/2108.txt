CLINICAL:
Colonoscopy.  Urgent.  Transverse colon polyp Bx.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Transverse colon lesion bx" consists of two biopsies 2 to 3mm.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Transverse polyp" consists of one biopsy 3mm.  AE 1 block.
(TO:  GB; FA/bl 14/2/64)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr H Mccool)
A.  The biopsy shows a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Malignant glands of variable size and shape are associated with a focal desmoplastic stromal response. The morphology would be in keeping with primary colorectal carcinoma.  
B.  The transverse colon polyp is a tubular adenoma. There is no evidence of high grade dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Transverse colon lesion biopsy: Adenocarcinoma. 

B.  Transverse colon polyp: Tubular adenoma.
