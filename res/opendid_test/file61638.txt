Acral melanoma right ring finger previous punch biopsy.
Sentinel node right axilla 1.
Sentinel node right axilla 2.
Sentinel node right epitrochlear 1.
Sentinel node right epitrochlear 2.

NB. Fresh lesional tissue sampled for the biobank as requested by DX 28.08.69 12pm.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;MELANOMA RIGHT RING FINGER&amp;quot;. Consists of distal phalanx measuring 33x25x20mm disarticulated from DIPJ. Nail present. Over the palmer aspect there is an ill defined pigmented lesion approximately 7x6mm. It appears 15mm clear from soft tissue articular margin. Soft tissue margin shaved, embedded. Sectioning shows haemorrhagic area about 2mm depth below the skin surface and it is 8mm away from bone. No bone invasion identified. Bone located in decal and bone section will be achieved.

(1 soft tissue &amp;amp; skin margin enface; 2-4 serial slice of lesion tip to base, 5 two sections of bone underlying lesion, 6). Representative sections. (M-5)

B. &amp;quot;RIGHT RING FINGER BONE MIDDLE PHALANX&amp;quot;. Consists of bony fragment 12x8x6mm. Decalcified.

All embedded. (M-1/SM 11/3/2070 ank)

C. &amp;quot;SENTINEL NODE RIGHT AXILLA 1&amp;quot;. Consists of a lymph node 30mm, serially sliced. All embedded. (M-1)

D. &amp;quot;SENTINEL NODE RIGHT AXILLA 2&amp;quot;. Consists of a lymph node 5mm. All embedded. (1-1)

E. &amp;quot;SENTINEL NODE RIGHT EPITROCHLEAR&amp;quot;. Consists of lymph node 10mm, sliced. All embedded. (M-1)

F. &amp;quot;SENTINEL NODE RIGHT EPITROCHLEAR&amp;quot;. Consists of lymph node 8mm, bisected. All embedded. (2-1/SM 29/11/2068 ank)
