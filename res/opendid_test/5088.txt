CLINICAL:
Cervical.  Adenosquamous cervical cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 114g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 35mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 28 and has some mild nodular irregularityaround the os particularly posteriorly.  There is some potential scar also identified in the anterior and posterior cervical canal.  No definite tumour is identified.  The anterior soft tissue cervical margin is inked blue and the posterior cervical soft tissue margin is inked black.  The cut surface reveals the endometrium is 1mm over a total wall thickness of 22mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 70mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  The rightovary measures 30 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 20 x 10mm and has unremarkable simple cyst measuring 13mm in the cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 10 - remainder of anterior cervix AE from right to left; 11 to 13 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 14 to 20 - remainder of posterior cervix AE from right to left; 21 - right tube; 22 - right ovary; 23 - left tube; 24 & 25 - left ovary.  Please refer to attached diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Mulkey):
Sections of the cervix show a 0.1mm focus of residual invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the vicinity of scar tissue.  The carcinoma lies at a depth of 1mm and is 10mm from the circumferential and ectocervical resection margins.  No residual invasive adenocarcinoma is seen and there is no evidence of CIN or HPV effect.  Foci of endometriosis are also present within the scar.
The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  Both fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries:  0.1mm focus of residual squamous cell carcinoma, margins well clear.
