CLINICAL:
Stage 1C immature teratoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary", consists ofmultiple fragments of pale grey tissue 50 x 35 x 20mm in aggregate.  The largest fragment contains a pale grey nodule 25 x 20 x 10mm.  The second largest fragment appears to consist of fallopian tube 50mm in length and 7mm diameter. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - nodule (probable ovary); 4 - fallopian tube; 5 - RS smaller fragments.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall adhesion", consists of a piece of membranous grey tissue 20 x 5 x 3mm.AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of multiple fragments of adipose tissue 85 x 40 x 10mm in aggregate.  No focal lesions seen.  RS in 3 blocks.  
(TO: BO;RG/vo 30.3.65) 
(Reported by Dr. Y Bowron):
The previous review 97Q89826 is noted.
A.  Sections of the ovary show residual benign mature teratomatous elements.  
No immature areas are identified.The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B & C.  Sections show a few scattered hair shafts suggestive of previous rupture.  There is no evidence of immature teratoma or malignancy.
 
DIAGNOSIS:
Residual benign mature teratomatous foci present in the left ovary.  No immature areas seen.
