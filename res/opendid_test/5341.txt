CLINICAL:
IPMN.  Increased size, and fronds intra-ductal on EUS.  Whipple's.  Asthma/COPD. Anxiety, HTN.  Knee replacement, disc problems.  Pancreatic ca. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Pancreas", consists of a Whipple's resection comprising small bowel, head of pancreas and common bile duct.  The head of pancreas is 65 x 45 x 30mm.  The small bowel is 225mm in length and 70mm diameter.  The common bile duct is 70mm in length and 15mm across, and is patent with no focal lesions.  Attached to the common bile duct is a small amount of adiposetissue 50 x 40 x 20mm.  The pancreatic duct is markedly dilated, and is 14mm across.  The pancreatic duct mucosa appears diffusely haemorrhagic.  A connection between the distal pancreatic duct and ampulla could not be demonstrated despite repeated probing. The pancreatic parenchyma shows homogenous lobulated tan tissue.  No focal pancreatic lesions are identified.  A 20mm lymph node liesadjacent to the common bile duct.  
The portal vein margin is inked blue, uncinate margin black, pancreatic neck margin red, anterior pancreatic surface yellow and posterior pancreatic surface green.
Block 1 - proximal small bowel margin; 2 - distal small bowel margin; 3 - shave common bile duct margin; 4-7 - pancreatic neck margin serially embedded from superior to inferior; 8-12 - uncinate margin serially embedded from superior to inferior; 13 & 14- one lymph node adjacent to distant common bile duct; 15 - multiple lymph nodes adjacent to common bile duct; 16-19 - remainder of pancreas serially embedded from distal to proximal pancreatic duct (ampulla in block 19).  Pancreas AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Greater omentum", consists of a sheet of greater omentum 430 x 400 x 20mm.  No focal lesions seen.  Representative sections in 3 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Bile duct margin", consists of a segment of bile duct 7mm in length and 14mm in diameter.  The mucosa appears unremarkable.  BAE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Pancreatic duct stone", consists of three fragments of white tissue 4-6mm across. AE 1 block.  (TO: PV/ec  11.12.64) 
 

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Dirickson/Dr T Reihing)
A.  The pancreas has been entirely embedded.  Each block of the pancreatic duct has been examined at multiple levels. 
The pancreas shows preservation of the normal lobular architecture with patchy atrophy of the exocrine pancreas.  Prominent fibrosis is seen, as well as aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells.  The main pancreatic duct epithelium is partially denuded.  The residual intact epithelium shows squamous metaplasia and regenerative changes as well as adjacent areas of recent haemorrhage.  Some of the larger ducts contain acellular eosinophilic proteinaceous concretions in the lumen.  These features are consistent with chronic pancreatitis.  The lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
There is no evidence of dysplasia, in-situ or invasive malignancy. There is no evidence of a papillary lesion.
B.  The sections show adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The section shows bile duct with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of dysplasia ormalignancy.
D.  The section shows acellular eosinophilic proteinaceous material, similar to the concretions seen in the pancreas.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Discussed with Dr Waylon on 18/11/64.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to C.  Pancreas (Whipple's resection), greater omentum, separate bile duct margin and pancreatic duct stone:
	Dilated distal pancreatic duct, chronic pancreatitis with fibrosis and atrophy.
	No evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

D. Pancreatic duct ? stone: acellular eosinophilic proteinaceous concretions
