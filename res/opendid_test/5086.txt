Result to the Anaesthetist Dr Merle by Dr E Reatherford at 06:33pm on 02.02.2066
B.  Specimen labelled "2nd tier sentinel lymph node left axilla 2375" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 15 x 10mm containing a lymph node 20mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph node is serially sectioned and AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left breast sutures long lateral, short superior" consists of a mastectomy measuring 250 x 200 x 80mm.  There is an ellipse of skin, 175 x 80mm,  containing a unremarkable nipple areola complex.  The skin is also unremarkable.  There are two sutures orientating long lateral, short superior.  The superficial surface is inked blue and the deep black.  On sectioning there are two tumours.  
Tumour 1 located approximately 8 to 9 o'clock, 50mm from the nipple measures 18 x 10 x 10mm.  The tumour is surrounded byfibrous tissue.  The margins are as follows:  5mm deep, 50mm inferior, 60mm superior, 45mm superficial, 25mm medial and approximately 170mm lateral.  
The second tumour at 9 to 10 o'clock approximately 60mm from the nipple, and 15mm from tumour one,  measures 10 x 7 x 7mm.    The margins for tumour 2 are as follows:  15mm superior, 60mm inferior, 20mm medial, 5mm deep, 8mm superficial and approximately 170mm lateral.
Blocks:  1 - nipple areola complex; 2 - tumour 1 full face; 3 & 4 - paired blocks tumour 1 and 2 (the joined surfaces are nicked); 5 - superior margin tumour 1; 6 - medial margin tumour 2; 7 - tumour 2 and superficial margin; 8 - tissue adjacent to tumour 1 laterally; 9 - upper outer quadrant; 10 - upper inner quadrant; 11 - lower inner quadrant; 12 - lower outer quadrant; 13 - tumour 1 tissue for Bio Bank.  The tumours are AE.  Please see diagram.  (TO: IZ; TL/rt 3.2.66): 14 to 17 - lower inner quadrant to lower outer quadrant between blocks 11 & 12; 18 - tissue deep to nipple section (block 1); 19 to 21 - composite blocks, nipple and tissue deep to nipple; 22 - ? medial edge of  tumour 1.  (TO: RO; JR/rt 5.2.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Castillejo):
A.  The largest node, of three separate lymph nodes, contains a small cluster of malignant cells within a subcapsular sinus, measuring less than 0.1mm and consistent with isolated tumour cells.  The CAM 5.2 keratin immunostain is negative in a deeper section, not containing this cluster.  
B.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.  There is an aggregate of a few separate nests of bland nevoid -type cells within the fibrous capsule of  the  node across 0.2mm.  No mitoses, significant cytological atypia or pigment is seen in this group.  The appearances are compatible with a capsular naevus.  Immunostains cannot be preformed as the focusis cut out in deeper levels.  The CAM 5.2 keratin immunostain is negative in a deeper section, not containing these cells.
C.  Sections show two separate infiltrating ductal carcinomas.  The main tumour (tumour 1), located at 8 - 9o'clock 50cm FN, is a 20mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.  The second tumour (tumour 2) is about 15mm from tumour 1, at  9 - 10 o'clock 60cm FN, and is A 10.5mm grade 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST. Each tumour arises within a field of confluent low and predominantly intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) across approximately 70mm.  The DCIS involves ducts deep to the nipple, extends into the lower outer quadrant and is present both within and beyond the confines of tumour 1, in intervening tissue between the tumours and within tumour 2.  There are also a few foci of flat epithelial atypia and atypical ductal hyperplasia the latter either in the form of columnar cell alteration with superimposed architectural and cytological atypia equivalent to ADH or partial involvement of ducts.  The tumours have the following features.

Synoptic Report for Breast Carcinoma.
Invasive carcinoma:

Tumour one (eg block 2).
Site: Left breast 8 - 9 o'clock 50cm FN.  
Type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.
The carcinoma is composed predominantly of tubules or complex glandular structures with a component arranged in solid nests and cords.  The tumour cells display variably pleomorphic nuclei (up to grade 3) and display intracytoplasmic and intraluminal mucin.  There is central sclerotic stroma. No significant extracelluluar mucin or signet ring component is seen.
Invasive tumour size: 20mm (four consecutive slices)
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 2
Tubules: 2     Nuclei: 3     Mitoses: 1    Mitotic rate: 6/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: One focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion present(Block C13), however, there is also retraction artefact closeby making definitive diagnosis difficult.

Tumour two (eg block C7).
Site: Left breast 9 - 10 o'clock 60cm FN.  
Type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST 
The tumour is composed separate and anastomosing well formed angulated and round tubular glands lined by cells with grade 2 nuclei.  There is associated fibrohyaline stoma.  Patchy apical snouts are seen.  No intracellular or intraluminal mucin.  A central core biopsy tract is present.
