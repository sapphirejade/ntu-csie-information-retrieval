B.  Specimen labelled "Right hemi vulvectomy stitch at 12 o'clock ", consists of an orientated triangular piece of skin measuring 80 x 55 to a depth of 30mm.  There is a stitch at one end marking 12 o'clock.  There is an exophytic nodule on the surface measuring 10 x 10mm, 20mm from the 3 o'clock margin and 15mm from the 6 o'clock margin.  There is a subcutaneous nodule measuring approximately 30mm with an overlying scar on the surface of the skin measuring 10mm in length.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock black.  Onsectioning the nodule measures 25 x 20 x 20mm with two surrounding satellite nodules measuring 5 and 10mm each.  The nodule is composed of a opaque yellow cut surface with areas of petechial haemorrhage throughout.  No necrosis is identified.  The nodule is approximately 2mm from the deep aspect, 15mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 10mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 30mm from the 12 o'clock margin, 15mm from the 6 o'clock margin and breaches the skinsurface.  
Blocks: 1 -  LS 12 o'clock margin; 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 18 - composite blocks, TS from 3 to 9 o'clock through lesion; 19 to 29 - LS through 6 o'clock margin from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left vagina margin", consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin measuring 15 x 5mm to a depth of 10mm.  The skin surface is smooth and no lesionsare identified.  The deep aspect is inked black.  The specimen serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.
Blocks: 1 - TS edges; 2 - two TS mid.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral inguinal lymph node", consistsof three pieces of firm fatty tissue measuring 18, 20 and 30mm in length containing lymph nodes measuring 3 to 15mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are AE.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 and 3 - lymph nodes asseen.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right medial inguinal lymph node", consists of two pieces fibrofatty tissue measuring 80 and 30mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring 2 to 8mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - lymph nodes as seen.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right femoral lymph node", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 and 15mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are seen measuring from 5 to8mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - lymph nodes as seen.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Munk):
A. Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 25 x 20mm, based in the subepithelial connective and adipose tissue.  The maximum depth of invasion is 22 mm.  The lesion has focally ulcerated through the overlying squamous epithelium (B26). The adjacent squamous epithelium shows no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. No residual Bartholin's gland is identified in the lesion.
No lymphovascular invasion is seen.
The lesion is 0.5mm from the inferior soft issue margin (B26). It is also 0.9mm from the deep margin (B25), 7mm from the medial and lateral margins and is > 20mm from the superior margin.
C. Sections show squamous epithelium and underlying connective tissue with no evidence malignancy.
D. Sections show 6 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
E. Sections show 3lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
F. Sections show 3 lymph nodes with no evidence malignancy.
COMMENT:
While no residual normal Bartholin's gland is identified, the site of the lesion would be consistent with origin from Bartholin's gland.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Frozen section right medial inguinal lymph node: 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy
B. Right hemivulvectomy: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (see comment), measuring 25 x 20mm, depth of invasion 22mm, 0.5mm nearest inferior soft tissue margin, no lymphovascular invasion 
C. Left vaginal margin: no evidence of malignancy
D to F. Right lateral and right medial inguinal, right femoral lymph nodes: 12 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
