HISTORY:
PMP.  Peritoneal disease.  Peritoneal disease at Rt paracolic gutter.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  "PERITONEAL DISEASE". Omentum measuring up to 520x200x15mm showing multiple haemorrhagic areas and fibrous adhesions.  No definite tumour deposits are identified.  Separate in the specimen container are multiple pieces of peritoneal surface with attached fatty tissue, measuring in aggregate 70x70x50mm.  There are multiple firm areas ? tumour deposit noted on the surface (measuring up to 10mm in maximal extent each).
(1-6 representative peritoneal areas with ragged ? tumour deposit; 7-13 representative omentum with haemorrhagic and firmer areas ? tumour deposit).  RS (M-13)
B.  "PERITONEUM FROM RIGHT PARACOLIC GUTTER".  Apiece of grey and fatty tissue measuring 10mm in maximal extent.  There is a small nodule 2mm in maximal extent ? tumour.  AE (1-1/FZ/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr R Keegan)
A.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with a few patchy foci of fibrous scar tissue containing one or two foreign body multinucleated giant cells.Very focally there are few small isolated deposits of organising acellular mucin with no atypical epithelium present.
B.  Histology shows further fibrofatty tissue with a focus of maturing fibrous scar tissue.  No evidence of mucinous deposits or atypical epithelium is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  PERITONEAL DISEASE - 
-FOCALLY INVOLVED BY ORGANISING ACELLULAR MUCIN.
B.  PERITONEUM FROM RIGHT PARACOLIC GUTTER -
-FOCAL FIBROSIS, NO MUCINOUS DEPOSITS IDENTIFIED.
