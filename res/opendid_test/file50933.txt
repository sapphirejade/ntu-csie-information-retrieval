It is 25mm from lateral margin, 25mm from inferior margin, 42mm from superior, 140mm from medial, 12mm from posterior, and 10mm from anterior margin. The lesion is 55mm from nipple. The second lesion which is located in the 10 o&amp;apos;clock region and appears contiguous to the first lesion and joined by fibrous strands, measures 15mm superior to inferior, 20mm medial to lateral, 12mm from anterior to posterior. It is 55mm from nipple, 40mm from lateral margin, 125mm from medial margin, 30mm from superior margin, 65mm from inferior margin, 12mm from posterior margin and 5mm from skin/anterior margin. No other lesions are identified.
