HISTORY:  
CR Cancer. ?Peritoneal disease. Colorectal cancer. Redo-peritonectomy.
- Frozen section. 
- Rt paracolic disease
- Peritoneum
- Rt diaphragm
- Liver sub-segment
- Uterus. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "PERITONEAL BIOPSY". Consists of piece of tissue, measuring 10x3x2mm. 
F/S: "Fibrous tissue with vascular dilatation" per phone to Prof. Cruz by Dr. Z. Delariva at 10:05am on 26/05/65.
Whole specimen was embedded in one block. AE (M-1)
B. "UTERUS, LIVER TUMOUR R DIAPHRAGM AND PERITONEAL DISEASE". Consists of uterus with amputated cervix and few pieces of peritoneum. The uterus with cervix measures 90x55x45mm. The specimen weighs 160g. The serosal surface of the fundus appears slightly uneven. The uterus was sectioned longitudinally. There is a polyp in the fundus, measuring up to15mm in maximal extent. The endometrium appears up to 1mm in thickness, the myometrium is up to 21mm in thickness. The specimen was sectioned. Representative sections embedded.
(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 anterior body; 4 posterior body; 5 anterior fundus; 6 posterior fundus; 7 more representative sections of the polyp and the fundus; 8 representative sections of the fundus with uneven serosa; 9&10 representative sections of the peritoneum fromthe anterior right aspect of the uterus; 11&12 peritoneum from the anterior left aspect of the uterus). 
There is separate piece of tissue in the container, probabe piece of diaphragm, measuring 55x35x9mm. There is a pale round lesion within this piece measuring 22x20mm. There is disrupted piece of tissue measuring 30x20x10mm, most likely a portion of liver. The piece of tissue is sectioned transversely and all embedded. There are few pieces of peritoneum, measuring in aggregate 70x60x20mm. There are no obvious deposits of tumour identified. The piece of tissue is sectioned, representative sections are embedded in three blocks. 
(13,14&15 representative sections of the ?diaphragm;16&17 section of the liver, the whole piece of liver is embedded; 18-20 representative sections of the peritoneum).
C. "RIGHT PARACOLIC GUTTER". Consists of fibrofatty piece of tissue, measuring 35x30x20mm. The specimen is sectioned transversely. It appears multicystic with thin wall cyst filled with clear fluid. The specimen was sectioned and all embedded in three blocks. AE (M-3/ BW/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. Z. Perri)       
A.  Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of scar tissue with prominent somewhat dilated vessels. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections of the portion of diaphragm show involvement by metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The morphology of the carcinoma is consistent with primary colorectal origin. The carcinoma involves virtually the full thickness of the diaphragm in the involved portion. 
Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections confirm a benign endometrial polyp, and the adjacent endometrium is probable mid secretory phase. The myometrium is unremarkable. Sections of the peritoneum, both in continuity with the uterus as well as separately submitted, show scattered areas of fibrosis with suture granulomas.  
Sections of the portion of liver show noevidence of metastatic malignancy. The architecture is normal and no specific abnormalities are identified. 
C.  Sections show a number of dilated irregular cystic spaces lined by an attenuated layer of bland mesothelium deep to surface mesothelium. There is no evidence of atypia or infiltrative architecture and the appearances favour a benign multicystic mesothelial proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains confirm the mesothelial nature of the lining of the cystic spaces with positive staining for calretinin, WT1and HBME1 and negative staining for CD31 and CD34.
