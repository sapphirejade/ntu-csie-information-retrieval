B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right ovary and tube&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube and ovary.  The fallopian tube measures 40mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  The ovary measures 60 x 43 x 40mm.  The ovary is a multiloculated cyst with serous yellow fluid and  pale inspissated material. The cyst wall is unremarkable.  Blocks: 1 to 5 - RS of right ovary; 6 - two RS of fimbria and three TS of body.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left ovary and tube&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary.  The fallopian tube measures 35mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  The ovary measures 25 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Blocks: 1 - four TS of ovary; 2 - three TS of ovary; 3 - two RS of fimbriae and two TS of fallopian tube.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Transverse colon surface tumour&amp;quot;, consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 5mm and 10 x 5 x 4mm.  Specimen is serially sliced.  Blocks: 1 - three TS; 2 - four TS.  AE 2 blocks.   (TO:FY/vo 24/8/67)

A, B, C &amp;amp; D.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma of the right ovary, extensively involving the omentum and transverse colon serosa, and also involving the surface and cortex of the left ovary, and the mucosa and lamina propria of both tubes.  No carcinoma in situ is seen in the tubes.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of the right ovary also involving the left ovary, both tubes, omentum and transverse colon serosa.
