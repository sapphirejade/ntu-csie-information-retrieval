CLINICAL:
?Sarcoma - right paravaginal/pararectal mass and lesions suspicious of lungmets.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Paravaginal mass", consists of two fragments of pale tan brown tissue measuring 7mm x 3 x 2mm.  AE 2 blocks.  (TO: UV;EM/vo 17.4.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Haeckel):
Sections show one piece of tumour tissue and one piece of squamous epithelium with underlying tissue.  The tumour is moderately cellular.  It consists of atypical spindle shaped cells with moderately pleomorphic, sometimes hyperchromatic, nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour cells stain positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin, confirming that this isa smooth muscle tumour.  There is some tumour necrosis.  No mitoses are identified.  A Ki-67 stain shows an overall low proliferation index in this small biopsy, estimated around 2 - 3%.  The tumour cells stain strongly and diffusely positive for oestrogen receptors and around 50% of the cells show strong staining for progesterone receptors.
The appearances are of a smooth muscle tumour showing cytologic atypia and necrosis.  No mitoses are identified in this biopsy sample.  The features are highly suspicious of a leiomyosarcoma.  The slides have also been viewed by Dr B Mascolo.
DIAGNOSIS:
Paravaginal mass:  Smooth muscle tumour with atypia and necrosis, highly suspicious for leiomyosarcoma.
