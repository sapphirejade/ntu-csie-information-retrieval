HISTORY:  
Recurrent low-grade appendicular Neoplasm(---illegible). 
- Colon, small bowel
- Liver segment IV.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "LIVER SEGMENT IV". An unorientated segment of liver, 17g, 50x30x25mm. The surgical margin inked black. The specimen is cut into 9 slices. From slice 2-8, there is a lesion inside ?mucous.
(1 slice two; 2&3 slice three; 4&5 slice four; 6 slice five; 7 slice six; 8 slice seven; 9 slice eight; 10LS section of slice nine; 11 LS section of slice one). RS (M-11)
B. "COLON/SEGMENT OF SMALL BOWEL". Six pieces of bowel, two large bowel, four small bowel plus one piece of fibrofatty tissue.
-Piece of colon measures 50x25x10mm plus attached mesenteric fat measures 70x90mm. Mucosal is unremarkable. 
?a polyp/diverticulum measures 5x5mm, 30mm to surgical margin. One surgical margin inked blue, the other inked black.
(1 LS of two margins; 2,3,4,5 sections of lesion. No lymph nodes detected in mesenteric fat).
-There is another piece of small bowel, measuring 65x30x10mm, unorientated. Mucosa and serosa are unremarkable. It has two surgical margins. One end inked blue, the other inked black. 
(6 two LS segments of two margins; 7 representative section of this small bowel).
-Another piece of small bowel with two pieces of anastomosis measures 45x60x20mm. 
There is a ?thin nodule mucosa 3mm to one of the surgical margin, the black surgical margin, measures 3x4mm. 
 (8&9 LS of margin; 10, 11&12 random section).
-Another piece of colon measures 70x20x20mm, non-orientated, mucosa is unremarkable with mesenteric fat attached 80x40mm. One margin inked blue, the other black.
(13 two LS of each margin; 14 lymph node; 15 RS of the representative section of the specimen).
-Piece of small bowel measures 130x40x15mm. There is an anastomosis 40mm to one margin, 70mm to the other margin. Serosa and mucosa looks unremarkable.
(16&17 LS of margin; 18 random section; 19 anastomosis).
-Piece of large bowel with a meso. The large bowel measures 150x40x20mm, meso is 60x130mm. There is anastomosis as well in the mucosa. Otherwise the mucosa is unremarkable. One margin inked blue, the other black. 
(20&21 LS of margin; 22&23 anastomosis [there is a 15x5mm nodule within the lumen in cut-up; 23 three lymph nodes]; 24 consists of a nodule).
-There is a piece of fibrofatty tissue measures 65x45x10mm. 
(26&27 representative sections of fibrofatty tissue). RS (M-27/WX/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr R Handley)
A. Sections show small bowel which is adherent toliver capsule. At this site there is a mucinous lesion comprised of complex glandular structure lined by mucin secreting epithelium admixed with extravasated mucin. There is no involvement of the liver parenchyma. The hepatocytes show moderate to severe macro and microvesicular steatosis. Most of the tumour shows low grade atypia. However, some of the glands show pseudostratification with scattered mitotic figures, suggestive of moderate dysplasia. The extravasated mucin extrude onto the surface of the small bowel. 
Features are consistent with disseminated low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm with increased proliferation. 
B.  Sections from one of the colonic segments show an area of ulceration with inflamed granulation tissue and fibrous scarring which extends into the subserosal fat. There is haemosiderin deposition within the granulation tissue. Diverticulae are identified. 
Sections of one small bowel segments show serosal congestion and adhesions associated with acute inflammatory cell infiltrate. Focally, within the muscularis propria of the small bowel, foreign body reaction is identified. 
Sections from the colonic mesentery show an abscess formation. Granular debris are noted within the abscess. No evidence of malignancy in two lymph nodes identified. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  LIVER SEGMENT4 - DISSEMINATED LOW GRADE APPENDICEAL MUCINOUS NEOPLASM WITH INCREASED PROLIFERATION. 
B.  COLON/ SEGMENT OF SMALL BOWEL - 
 - COLONIC ULCERATION, FOREIGN BODY REACTION AND ABSCESS FORMATION.
