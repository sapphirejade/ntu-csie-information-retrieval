MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes & ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 127g in total.  The uterus comprises of corpus and cervix measuring 80 x 60 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 30 x 20mm. The cervical mucosa is unremarkable. The entire endometrial cavity is filled with a fleshy tumour.  The tumour invades into the deep myometrium with a maximal depth of 16mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 19mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter and has an unremarkable appearance.  The right ovary measures 
25 x 15 x 5mm.  The right ovary is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 30mm in length and 5mm in diameter and has an unremarkable appearance.  The left ovary measures 30 x 15 x 5mm.  The left ovary is unremarkable.  Blocks 1-5 ? one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 6 & 7 ? anterior endomyometrium; 8-10- full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 ? posterior endomyometrium; 13 ? reserved block; 14 & 15 ? right fallopian tube; 16 ? right ovary; 17 & 18 -2TS left fallopian tube; 19 ? left ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled ?Right obturator nodes?, consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 10 and 15mm.  Macroscopically no lymph nodes are identified.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Swaim)
A. Sections of uterus show a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (Figo grade 1).  The carcinoma shows architectural grade 1 and no solid component is seen.  The tumour cells show nuclear grade 1 to 2.  The carcinoma invades more than one half of myometrium and the maximal depth of invasion is 16mm.  The thickness of myometrium is 18mm.  The tumour invades the endocervix and cervical stroma (block A8).  The ectocervix is unremarkable.  The tumour does not extend beyond uterus and is completely excised.  Lymphovascular invasion is focally present.  The uterine serosa is unremarkable.  Both fallopian tubes show changes of salpingitis.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.
B. Sections show adipose tissue and blood vessels.  No lymph node is seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries 
? Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1);
? Depth of invasion 16mm/myometrial thickness 18mm; ? Invades endocervix and cervical stroma; ? Lymphovascular invasion.
B. Right obturator nodes ? Adipose tissue with no evidence of malignancy.
