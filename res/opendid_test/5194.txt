CLINICAL:
AVR - aortic leaflets.  MVR - mitral leaflets.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Lt valve leaflets" consists of three valve leaflets, 15-38mm across.  There is a minimal degree of calcification.  No vegetations are seen.  RS in 1 block.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Mitral valve" consists of two pieces of heart valve with attached chordae tendineae, 20 and 22mm across.  No calcification or vegetations are seen.  RS in 1 block.  (BZ/mm 16.12.65)  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr A Suitor):
A.  Sections of aortic valve show nodular calcific aortic sclerosis.  There is no significant inflammation or neovascularisation.  No vegetations are seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections of mitral valve show myxoid degeneration.  There is no significant inflammation or neovascularisation.  No vegetations are seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Aortic Valve:  Nodular calcific aortic sclerosis
B.  Mitral valve:  Myxoid degeneration.
