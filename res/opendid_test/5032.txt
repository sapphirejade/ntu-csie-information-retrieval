CLINICAL:
PH VIN.  New VIN ?invasion.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right vulva biopsy" consists of a 4mm punch biopsy to a depth of 7mm.  BAE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left vulva biopsy" consists of a 5mmpunch biopsy to a depth of 3mm.  BAE 1 block.  (TO: RX; NO/rt 29.5.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Balzotti):
A. The sections ofvulval mucosa show VIN 2 (usual type). There are foci of fibrinoid deposition and fibroblastic proliferation beneath the epithelium in areas, consistent with ulceration and regeneration.   Dysplastic epithelium extends along adnexal structures and there is focal micro-invasive squamous cell carcinoma 0.3mm from the edge of a hair follicle (re-cut level 2).
B. The sections of vulval mucosa show VIN 2 (usual type).  There is marked active chronic inflammation in the subepithelial tissues. Dysplasticepithelium extends along adnexal structures. There is focal incipient invasion but no unequivocal stromal invasion is seen.  Representative slides have been shown to Dr Ngarrindjeri Brumett who agrees with incipient invasion.
CONCLUSION
A. Right vulval biopsy: VIN 2, focal micro invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
B.Left vulval biopsy: VIN 2, incipient invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
