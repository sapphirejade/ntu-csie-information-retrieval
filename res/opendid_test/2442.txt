CLINICAL:
Metastatic melanoma.  Bx proven melanoma met stomach.  Partial stomach.  


MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Gastric melanoma" and consists ofa piece of gastric wall, 60 x 30 x 5mm.  There is a central polypoid lesion, 20 x 18 x 5mm, with a haemorrhagic appearance.  The tumour appears to invade into but not through the muscularis propria.  The overlying serosa is smooth.  The tumour is 5mm clear of the closestcircumferential margin.  Blocks: 1 to 4 - tumour serially embedded; 5 - uninvolved stomach.  (TO: KX; OO/ta 25/9/65) 


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Forberg):
The sections show gastric wall containing an ulcerated spindle cell malignancy centred in thedeep submucosa.  The tumour cells are arranged in short fascicles and storiform patterns.  There is patchy intracytoplasmic brown pigment.  The nuclei are elongated with vesicular chromatin and occasional enlarged nucleoli.  Mitoses are readily identifiable (up to 18/10HPF).  The tumour shows diffuse positive staining with SOX10 and S100, and patchy positive staining with HMB45.  These features are consistent with metastatic spindle cell melanoma.
The tumour infiltrates through lamina propria into muscularis propria, to a depth of 9mm.  No serosal involvement is seen.  The tumour is 0.5mm clear of the deep submucosal margin, and 5mm clear of the circumferential mucosal margin.  Perineural invasion is present.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
The uninvolved gastric mucosa shows no significant abnormality.  No Helicobacter organisms are identified.
DIAGNOSIS:
Partial stomach:  
-  Metastatic melanoma.
-  Margins free of tumour.
-  Perineural invasion present.
