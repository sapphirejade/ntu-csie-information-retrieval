HISTORY:
L rectus muscle hard mass ?cancer. Frozen section. Low grade appendix cancer. Behind umbilicus nodule. Right iliac fossa nodule. Gallbladder, spleen, omentum, left ovary, peritoneum. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "BEHIND UMBILICUS NODULE". Two pieces of rubbery tissue 8x20mm in diameter. No obvious lesion. 
F/S: "Fibrovascular tissue and muscle, focal FBR". 
One block and a piece of fibro fatty tissue measuring 30x35x5mm. AE (M-4).
B. "RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA NODULE". A piece of rubbery tissue 55x30x20mm with no obvious nodule. A representative section examined. 
F/S: "Dense fibrous tissue with focal FBR". 
A block and a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 60x50x10mm. RS (M-3).
C. 'LEFT RECTUS MUSCLE". A piece of rubbery tissue 15mm in diameter. No discrete lesion.
F/S:  Muscle with focal FBR". Reported by Dr P Hedon to Anaesthetist at 12.05pm on 27.01.65.
A block and a piece of rubbery fatty tissue measuring 30x20x10mm. AE (M-2).
D. "OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, OVARY AND SPLEEN". 
-An ovary 30x30x15mm with a cyst which is 20x15mm. The cut surface shows the cyst, corpus luteum, corpus albicans. 
-Gallbladder 80x35mm. The serosa looks unremarkable. The wall is 2mm in thickness. The mucosa looks unremarkable. There is a ?nodule in thefundus. 
-Spleen, 95x50x30mm, 65g, looks unremarkable
-Omentum is 150x150x30mm. Unremarkable cut surface.
-Peritoneum.
(1-4 ovary; 5 TS section of attached fallopian tube).
(6 cystic duct; 7 TS body; 8 LS fundus). 
(9-12 representative sections of spleen).
(13-19 RS of omentum). RS (M-19/RJh/t).
Further tissue (Omentum 20-24, M-24/PJ/ld).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr P Posa)
A,B&C. Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis in each specimen of benign fibroadipose tissue. The specimens are composed of fragments of scar tissue including suture granulomas. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show focal infiltration of the omentum by organising mucin. No epithelium is identified within the mucin. There are also scattered foci of organising mucin on the surface of the ovary. The ovarian parenchyma is otherwise within normal limits. Splenic parenchyma is unremarkable. Sections of the gallbladder show features of mild chronic cholecystitis. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  NODULE BEHIND UMBILICUS - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
B.  RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA NODULE - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
C.  LEFT RECTUS MUSCLE - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
D.   OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER AND OVARY - 
 - FOCAL INVOLVEMENT OF OMENTUM BY ORGANISING MUCIN, 
   NO EPITHELIUM IDENTIFIED.
 - ORGANISING MUCINON OVARIAN SURFACE. 
 - UNREMARKABLE  SPLEEN AND GALLBLADDER.
