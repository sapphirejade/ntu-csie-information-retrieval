CLINICAL NOTES:
G I-II endometrioid uterine ca.

1.  Peritoneal washings for cyto.
2.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries.
3.  Omental biopsy.
4.  Right pelvic sentinel node.
5.  Left pelvic sentinel node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES (BILATERAL)&amp;quot;.  A total hysterectomy specimen, 48g.  It is disrupted due to surgical opening coronally.  The uterus measures 65x40x20mm.  Attached is right fallopian tube 35x5mm, right ovary 15x6x6mm, left fallopian tube 35x4mm.  No definite left ovary is identified.  At the anatomical site of the left ovary, there is an ill-defined thickening of the broad ligament over 10x10x6mm.  The cervix measures 25x20x20mm.  The external os is oval 12x4mm.  The anterior margin is inked blue, posterior is inked black.

There is an area of thickened endometrium at the posterior left body measuring 12x10mm. It is 6mm thick out of 11mm (thickness over total myometrial thickness).  It is confined to the uterine body and located within 5mm of the left cornu.   No serosal involvement is identified.  The cut surface of both tubes and the right ovary is unremarkable.

(1  right tube two LS fimbrial end one TS mid; 2  two LS right ovary; 3  right parametrium; 4&amp;amp;5  left fallopian tube and adjacent thickened tissue serially sliced; 6  left parametrium; 7&amp;amp;8  LS anterior uterus [7  cervix, 8  fundus and body]; 9  LS posterior uterus; 10  TS isthmus; 11-15  uterine body from isthmus to fundus).  RS (M-15).  Please refer to diagram.

B.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue measuring 65x30x18mm.  The cut surface is fatty across the specimen.  No lesions are identified.

(1-4  representative).  RS (M-4).

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  A lymph node 22x9x4mm with unremarkable cut surface serially sliced.  AE (M-1).

D.  &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue 20x15x5mm, bearing one lymph node 7x5x5mm.  Serially sliced.  AE (M-1/ZH 6/9/2067 km).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
Immunostains for MMR proteins (DHM BEAUFORT & SKIPTON HEALTH SERVICES - BEAUFORT CAMPUS; block: A13)
MLH1: 	 positive
PMS2:  positive
MSH2:  positive
MSH6:  negative
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
