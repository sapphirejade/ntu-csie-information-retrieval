CLINICAL:
Likely MMMT.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymphnode" and consists of a single lymph node encased in adipose tissue measuring 30 x 17 x 10mm.  Complete lymph node submitted for frozen section (x2).
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one;2 - frozen section two; 3 - associated fibroadipose tissue.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign lymph node.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
Result to Dr Krysta FALHA by A/Prof L Lassere and Dr L Tadgerson on 18/02/2066 at 12:35.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries and cervix" and consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and bilateral ovaries weighing 116g.  The uterus measures 92 x 68 x 47mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 34 x19mm with an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, there is a large pale grey nodular tumour within the uterine cavity; patchy areas of necrosis are seen.  The tumour appears to extend to a depth of 13mm.
The left fallopian tube measures 38 x 7 x 6mm.  The left ovary measures 17 x 11 x 8mm, with an unremarkable cut surface; there is a 10mm paratubal cyst.  The right fallopian tube measures 53 x 6 x 5mm.  The right ovary measures 18 x 10 x 8mm, with an unremarkable cut surface. 
Blocks: 1 to 4 - anterior LS uterus and cervix; 5 to 10 - anterior LS uterus (blocks paired & 6, 7 & 8, 9 & 10); 11 to 14 - posterior LS uterus and cervix; 15 to 17 - posterior LS uterus (16 - ?deepest invasion); 18 - TS bilateral cornu; 19 - complete fimbrial end left fallopian tube, plus mid TS and paratubal cyst; 20 -left ovary; 21 - complete fimbrial end right fallopian tube, plus mid TS; 22 -right ovary.  RS.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" and consists of omental tissue measuring 160 x 100 x 30mm.  No lymphnodes or lesions are macroscopically identified.  RS 3 blocks.  (TO: DX; EZ/ta 19/2/66) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Masten): 
A.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show an extensive grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No sarcomatous component is seen.  Much of the tumour is necrotic.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 15mm through a wall 15.5mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
C.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 15mm through a wall 15.5mm thick.  Focallymphvascular invasion is present.  Cervix uninvolved.  Two lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
