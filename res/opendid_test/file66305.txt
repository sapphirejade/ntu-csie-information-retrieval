- Other invasive tumour foci 8mm, 2mm, 1mm, 1mm

Histologic type:

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
DCIS is present associated with invasive carcinoma.
Size (extent) of DCIS:   at least 36mm estimated diameter (9 x 4mm slices)
Nuclear grade:  Grade II (intermediate) to Grade III (high)
Architecture patterns:  Cribriform
Necrosis:  Focal necrosis present
Calcification of DCIS: Not identified

MARGINS:
- - INVASIVE CARCINOMA MARGINS: - -
Positive margin(s), focal

Distance of invasive carcinoma from margins:
Anterior: 5mm
Posterior: 5mm
Superior: 10mm
Inferior: 8mm
* Medial: 0 mm, positive margin, section B27, focal margin involvement (&amp;lt;0.5mm length positive margin)
Lateral: 10mm

- - DCIS MARGINS: - -
Close negative margins (0 - 1.9mm), see NOTE#
NOTE#: Due to the growth pattern of DCIS in the ductal system, a negative but close margin does not ensure the absence of DCIS in the adjacent tissue

Distance of DCIS from margins:
Anterior: 6mm
