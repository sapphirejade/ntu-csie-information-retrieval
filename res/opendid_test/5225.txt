Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Ovarian mass.  DVT 2065.  MTHFR homozygous.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Leftovarian mass frozen section" consists of a mass 90 x 70 x 60mm with an irregular nodular surface which is rough in areas.  The cut surface shows predominantly myxoid material with peripheral necrosis.  2x frozen sections.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 to 12 - representative section.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour primary ovarian tumour possibly stromal ??.  Await paraffin for definitive diagnosis.
Result to Dr Shaun by Dr Y Hoitt at 3pm on 24.02.66.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + mass" consists of a uterus with attached cervix andseparate mass.  Uterus and cervix weighs 207g with uterus measuring 110 x 75 x 50mm with a tan serosal surface.  The serosal surface has a haemorrhagic appearance with friable fibrinous material attached possibly representing tumour.  This fibrinous material covers both the anterior and posterior surfaces.  The ectocervix measures 20 x 25mm and has unremarkable surface.  On the anterior section of the uterus is a endometrial polyp measuring 15 x 15mm.  There is a further polyp on the posterior endometrium measuring 10 x 5mm.  The endometrium is 1mm thick over a total wall thickness of 50mm.  The myometrium contains fibroids up to 60mm in maximum dimension with the largest fibroid in the posterior wall.  The separated mass measures 150 x 130 x 35mm and is pale tan in appearance and is disrupted with areas of haemorrhage.  On sectioning there are areas of necrosis, haemorrhage and mucinous/myxoid material.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 13 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 & 13 - paired blocks); 14 & 15 - representative sectionanterior uterine wall; 16 & 17 - representative section posterior uterine wall; 18 to 26 - representative section separate mass; 27 - reserved block for tumour banking.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a single specimen measuring 50 x 40 x 30mm in maximum dimension.  The tube length is 75mm x 15mm.  The ovary has a pale tan surface with areas ofhaemorrhage and fibrinous deposition.  On sectioning the ovary contains a cystic mass 20mm x 10mm.
Blocks:  1 - tube; 2 to 5 - further representative ovary.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of omental fat measuring 130 x 90 x 10mm.  No suspicious areas are identified from the specimen.  Representative section 3 blocks (blocks 1 to 3).
E.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix measuring 45 x 9mm.  On the surface is haemorrhagic and fibrinous material.  The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm.  The lumen contains a small amount of faecal material.
Blocks:  1 - tip LS; 2 - three TS mid; 3 - shaved margin and proximal TS.
F.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas" consists of three fragments of irregular tissue measuring up to 60 x 30 x 5mm in size.  The peritoneal surface is identified.  There is fibrinous necrotic and haemorrhagic material on the surface.  Representative section 3 blocks (blocks 1 to 3).
G.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic exudate" consists of two pieces of pale grey fibrinous material measuring up to 20 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side and peritoneum" consists of a single piece of tissue measuring 40 x 15 x 10mm.  The surface is haemorrhagic.  AE.
I.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas and peritoneum" consists of a single piece of dark tan material measuring 25 x 13 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported byDr Y Brannum):
A.  Sections show a clearcell carcinoma of the ovary.  The tumour is extensively necrotic.  The tube is not identified.
B.  Sections showthe separate mass is a clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.  The tumour is extensively necrotic.  The tube is not identified. 
Dense adhesions are present on the uterine serosa associated with endometriosis.
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium is proliferative and contains benign polyps.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.   
C.  The surface of the ovary shows scattered adhesions.  The tube is unremarkable.  
There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  There is no evidenceof malignancy.
E.  The appendiceal serosa shows dense adhesions.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show dense adhesions together with necrotic material;  necrotic tumour cannot be excluded.
G.  Sections show necrotic material which is favoured as probable necrotic tumour.
H.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Sections show dense adhesions.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Clear cell carcinoma of the left ovary.  Probable necrotic carcinoma is present in the specimen labelled 'pelvic exudate'.  Endometriosis is present.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by DrY Kin, 3.7.66)

Mismatch repair deficiency immunoperoxidase stains were requested at the Gynaecology Tumour board meeting. 
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
