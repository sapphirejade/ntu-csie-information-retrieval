HISTORY:  
Menorrhagia ++. Obesity. Endometrial carcinoma.
- Uterus + ovaries + tubes + cervix.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES". Uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The right fallopian tube is 50x8mm and is unremarkable. The right ovary is 30x20x10mm and is unremarkable. The left fallopian tube is 60x6mm and is unremarkable and the left ovary is 30x20x10mm and is unremarkable. The uterus alone weighs 335g and is 130mm from fundus to ectocervix. The uterine body is 85x65mm. The uterine cervix is approximately 30x25mm. The external cervical os is 20x5mm. The specimen is received opened coronally. There is a well-demarcated white fibroid in the subserosal area ofthe anterior myometrium which is 50mm in maximum dimension. The entire endometrial cavityis occupied by a firable tumour. The cervix appears macroscopically clear of tumour. The tumour measures 65mm in maximum (opened uterine) dimension.It invades approximately 15mm  in a myometrial thickness of 20-25mm. 
(1 right parametrium; 2 left parametrium; 3-9 surgical resection anterior myometrium [3 cervix; 4 isthmus with tumour; 5&6 single section showing relationship of tumour to leiomyoma; 7,8&9 body and fundus; 10-16 surgical sectionfrom posterior wall [10 cervix; 11 isthmus; 12-16 body and fundus]; 17&18 further section from posterior wall showing deepest area of invasion; 19-21 right fallopian tube and ovary; 22-24 left fallopian tube and ovary). RS (M-24/Larew/cy)
Further tissue:  (25 cervix; 26 anterior body with caesareansections cut; 27&28 section of the fundus with the tumour; 29&30 another section of the fundus with tumour).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Immunostains for MSI proteins (The PNC Financial TRESILLIAN FAMILY CARE CENTRE - WOLLSTONECRAFT Lab; block: 18)
MLH1:  Absent staining
PMS2:  Absent staining 
MSH2:  Positive stainingpresent
MSH6:  Positive staining present
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodiesused are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
