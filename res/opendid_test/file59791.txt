CLINICAL NOTES:
Ca ovary. Recent path review DHM. Histopathology pieces: 1. Omentum  2. Right pelvic side wall peritoneum 3. Small bowel mesentery 4. Rectal sigmoid serosa 5. Appendix 7. Right para-aortic node. 8. Left adnexa 9. Right adnexa 10. Right pelvic lymph node  11. Small bowel. Cytology: 6. Peritoneal washings.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;OMENTUM&amp;quot;. One piece of omental fatty tissue measuring 480x140x35mm. There is an indurated area within the omentum measuring 55x50x20mm with adherent peritonealised fatty tissue measuring 60x35x15mm. The surgical margin of the peritonealisd tissue is inked blue. The firm tissue contains cream coloured tumour nodules, which are clear of the blue inked surgical margin by 2mm.
(1-4 tumour adjacent to peritoneal wall tissue [1 and 2 tumour in peritoneal wall tissue with overlying omentum; 4 tumour within omentum]). Representative sections (4-4)
B. &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;. A 185mm length of small bowel with two non-stapled margins and with attached mesentery up to 70mm in thickness. One surgical margin is inked green. Between 50mm from the green inked margin and 110mm from the other margin, there is a mass in the wall of the small bowel which is ulcerating through the serosa, measuring 30x20x12mm. The mass does not involve the mucosa. The mucosa is unremarkable.
(1 green inked margin; 2 other margin).
The mass is 50mm from the mesenteric surgical margin. There is a white plastic ring within the mass, 4x2mm, ?possibly from a tied tube.
(3 one section of mass adherent to small bowel with plastic removed; 4 further section of mass, also with plastic removed; 5 three possible lymph nodes). Representative sections (M-5)
C. &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY&amp;quot;. Two pieces of fatty tissue measuring 22x7x7mm and 22x7x4mm. All embedded in one block. All embedded. (M-1)
D. &amp;quot;APPENDIX&amp;quot;. An appendix 55mm in length and 5mm in diameter with attached mesoappendix 63x22x15mm. The proximal end is inked blue. Representative sections in one block. Representative sections (M-1)
E. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Fatty tissue 40x23x5mm, containing two lymph nodes 18x12x4mm and 6x5x4mm. Both embedded in one block. Representative sections (M-1)
F. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SIDE WALL PERITONEUM&amp;quot;. One ragged strip of peritoneum and grey fibrous and yellow fatty tissue 125x30x5mm. One area of firmer nodular tissue measuring 25x23mm. The area underlying the firmer tissue is inked blue. Nodular area all embedded in Blocks 1 and 2. Representative sections (M-2)
G. &amp;quot;RIGHT PARA-AORTIC NODE&amp;quot;. Grey and yellow fatty tissue 27x20x13mm containing one grey nodule 14x9x9mm. The nodule is bisected and all embedded in one block. Representative sections (M-1)
H. &amp;quot;RIGHT ADNEXA&amp;quot;. Two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 50x35x13mm. All embedded in Blocks 1-5, one piece in 1 and 2 and one piece in 3-5.
J. &amp;quot;LEFT ADNEXA&amp;quot;. One piece of fibrofatty tissue 35x21x11mm. The tissue contains creamy white nodule 12x10x8mm and a second nodule 4mm across. All embedded. (M-3)
K. &amp;quot;RECTAL SIGMOID SEROSA&amp;quot;. One piece of fatty tissue 14x10x4mm with serosa on one edge, bisected and all embedded in one block. All embedded. (M-1/ FR 6/9/2069 cy)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. X. Aamodt)
(The previous diagnosis of high grade serous papillary carcinoma of the right ovary is noted in StVincent pathology report 97982-28TI, collected 16/6/2069).

A.  The omental fat shows extensive large deposits of high grade serous carcinoma characterised by papillary and micropapillary tumour sitting within cystic spaces and infiltrating into desmoplastic stroma.  The tumour is 1.5mm from the inked diathermy margin.  There is a separate focus of benign epithelial cyst and surrounding smooth muscle within the adhesion.  The epithelium is ciliated.

B.  The small bowel shows fibrotic mass attached to the mesentery which contains inflamed granulation tissue and associated small nests of carcinoma, with surrounding haemosiderin and inflammatory cells.  There is also viable carcinoma sitting on the serosal surface and as nodular deposits within the mesentery.  A benign serous epithelial cyst with surrounding smooth muscle is attached to the fibrous mass.

C.  The small bowel mesenteric fat shows a serosal deposit of metastatic carcinoma.

D.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the lumen.  There is no malignancy.

E.  Two lymph nodes with no malignancy.  There is metastatic carcinoma present on the serosal surface of the fatty tissue.

F.  The fibrofatty tissue shows nodules of metastatic carcinoma with surrounding desmoplasia.  They are 2.5mm from the closest diathermied margin.

G.  The lymph node is involved by a 12mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma. There is no extranodal spread.

H.  The fibrofatty tissue shows large areas of haemorrhage and organising granulation tissue and scarring.  Within this there are numerous deposits of serous carcinoma with papillary, micropapillary and sheet like growth pattern.  There are a few adjacent benign serous cysts with muscular stroma.  There are also sutures granulomas.  There is no recognisable ovary or fallopian tube tissue.  The tumour is extensive and involves the inked surface of multiple fragments.

J.  The tissue shows similar specimen to the right side with fibrofatty tissue showing large deposits of viable high grade serous carcinoma, involving the surface of most fragments.

K.  The fatty tissue shows small deposit of serous carcinoma in areas of diathermied tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  OMENTUM -  Metastatic carcinoma.
B.  SMALL BOWEL -  Metastatic carcinoma.
C.  SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY -  Metastatic carcinoma.
D.  APPENDIX -  Fibrous obliteration of the lumen.
E.  RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE -  Two lymph nodes with no malignancy.  Metastatic carcinoma on serosal surface of fat.
F.  RIGHT PELVIC SIDE WALL PERITONEUM -  Metastatic carcinoma.
G.  RIGHT PARA-AORTIC NODE -  Metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node.
H.  RIGHT ADNEXA -  High grade serous carcinoma.
J.  LEFT ADNEXA -  High grade serous carcinoma.
K.  RECTAL SIGMOID SEROSA -  Metastatic carcinoma.
