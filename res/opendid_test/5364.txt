CLINICAL:
Pancreatic cancer, pelvic mass Ca 125/>300.  Pancreatic cancer with lung mets.
Additional clinical history (from Dr T Springfield): Pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 2062 with bilateral lung metastases. The lung biopsy showed mucinous adenocarcinoma with a bronchoalveolar pattern, positivity for CK7, negative CK20 and patchy positivity TTF1. Thelung tumour was favoured to represent metastatic pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary" consists of a cystic ovary, 130 x 120 x 50mm having a smooth external surface.  The attached tube is 70 x 5 x 5mm.  Sectioning reveals solid and cystic area.  Cystic areas contain thick mucoid material.  Frozen section one - solid area.  Frozen section two cystic area.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 end; 4 to 6 - fallopian tube and cyst wall; 7 - cyst with paratubal tissue; 8 to 18 - representative sections of the cyst. (fallopian tube AE)
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 40mm long and 5mm in diameter with attached ovarian cyst 50 x 40 x 10mm.  The external surface of the ovary is nodular on the opposite side to the hilum, 20 x 15 x 5mm.  The ovarian cyst is a multiloculated cyst containing thick mucoid material.
Blocks:  1 - fimbria end; 2 & 3 - fallopian tube AE; 4 to 10- representative sections of the ovarian cyst (the external surface nodular area is AE).
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic peritoneum" consists of a fibrofatty tissue fragment, 33 x 15 x 3mm.  AE 3 blocks.  (TO: Garret; MALIK/rt 15.12.65)

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Mucinous tumour ?primary ?met (await paraffin).
Result to Dr Lamar RACIOPPI by Dr T Mahabir at 1:48pm on 14.12.2065
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Beerman and Dr T Sinibaldi)
A & B.  Sections of left and right ovaries show mucinous adenocarcinoma. The tumour is composed of variably sized infiltrative malignant glands and showing mild to moderate cytological atypia. In the right ovary, foci of poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma are identified. There is patchy ovarian surface involvement by carcinoma. The carcinoma is CK7 and CK20 positive. The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.
C.  Sections are of fibroadipose tissue showing metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. 
COMMENT:
There is extensive bilateral ovarian and peritoneal involvement by mucinous adenocarcinoma. Although the tumour is predominant moderately to well differentiated, there are scattered foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma in the right ovary. The carcinoma is CK7 and CK20 positive. 
As both primary ovarian and pancreatic mucinous carcinomasmay have identical morphology and are both CK7/20 positive, it is very difficult to accurately determine whether these ovarian tumours represent primary ovarian tumour or metastasis from a primary pancreatic lesion. 
Correlation with clinical, imaging and previous pathology findings is essential. 

DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes: Mucinous adenocarcinoma. 

C.  Left pelvicperitoneum: Metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma.
