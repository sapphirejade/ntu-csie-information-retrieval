MARGIN INKED:  Standard:  Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from lateral to medial.
Number of slices:  12
FINDINGS / LESION:  Underlying the yellow inked area is a cavity surrounded an area of haemorrhage and fibrosis.  This is in slices 3 to 5.  Also noted in slices 7 and 8, is a well demarcated pale white lesion measuring 5 superior to inferior x 5 anterior to posterior x approximately 5 medial to lateral.  The lesion is 15mm from superior, 15mm from inferior, 15mm from anterior, 14mm from posterior, 30mm from lateral and 16mm from medial margin.  Representative sections taken.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr O Keeney)
A. Routine and cytokeratin stained sections show two benign lymph nodes.

B. Sections show five distinct foci of invasive lobular carcinoma ranging from 12 to 1mm in size. There is extensive lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) including areas of pleomorphic LCIS.
Invasive lobular carcinoma is incompletely excised at the anterior margin and pleomorphic LCIS is 0.5mm from the anterior margin. See synoptic report.
