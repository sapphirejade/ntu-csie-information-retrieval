Distribution:  
CLINICAL:
Right upper lobe.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "R upper lobe" consists of a right upper lobectomy, 150 x 150 x 45mm with a pre-inflation weight of 185g.  There are two stapled margins over the hilar surface (inked blue).  Over the posterolateral pleural surface is an area of puckering (inked black).  Underlying the area of pleural puckering there is a peripheral tan tumour, 23 x 19 x 20mm.  The tumour is 1mm clearof the pleura and at least 25mm clear of the bronchial and stapled margins.  The remainder of the lung shows scattered cystically dilated air spaces, dilated up to 4mm.
Blocks:  1 - bronchial shave margin; 2 - hilar blood vessel shave margin; 3 - hilar lymph node; 4 - hilar lung; 5 & 6 - full cross section tumour; 7 - tumour with pleura; 8 & 9 - tumour (9 - reserved block); 10 - uninvolved lung and apical pleural plaque.
B.  Specimen labelled "R paratracheal LN" consists of five fragments of lymph node ranging from 5 - 15mm across.  AE 2 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "R hilar LN" consists of a lymph node 6mm across.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Superior R hilar" consists of a lymph node 10mm across.  AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Posterior hilar" consists of a lymph node 12mm across.  AE 1 block.  (TO: PD; AO/rt 17.6.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Callais/Dr W Krumvieda):
A.  The lung tumour is a poorly differentiated malignancy which has a circumscribed border.  The tumour cells are arranged in sheets with some areas of fascicular architecture.  The cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, markedly pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Many cells have unusual, bright eosinophilic cytoplasmic globules; these stain PAS positive and are diastase resistant, consistent with mucin globules.  Occasional multinucleate cells are seen.  Mitoses are frequent.  The tumour has prominent areas of geographic necrosis.  Aggregates of lymphocytes are seen at the periphery of the tumour.  No in-situ component is identified.  No definite glandular areas or keratinisation are seen.  One hilar node which was present with the lobe is free of tumour.
Immunostains:
TTF-1:  Negative,
Cytokeratin 5/6:  Positive.
P63:  Focal positive.
Pancytokeratin:  Positive.
The features are of a poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The positive mucin staining indicates glandular differentiation while the positive CK 5/6 staining indicates squamous differentiation.  The features are considered to be best classified as a poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma.
