HISTORY:  
Recurrent colorectal cancer. CRC.
- Peritoneal biopsy.
- Frozen section.Omentum, perinephric fat, suture mark on the lesion.
- Liver lesion segment 7.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "PERITONEAL BIOPSY". Two pieces of firm, fatty tissue each 15mm in maximal extent. Representative sections for frozen section.
F/S: "Scar tissue, no evidence of malignancy" per phone to liver fellow at10:20am by Dr. D. Triska on 10/6/65.
(1 CP, block is remaining of frozen section tissue; 2 contains remainder of the specimen). AE (M-2)
B. "OMENTUM, MESENTERIC NODULE, PERINEPHRIC FAT". Consists of omental tissue.The largest piece measuring up to 590mm. There are three smaller pieces of fat. The smallest piece measures up to 40mm with a tan nodule up to 10mm. The second largest piece has a suture at one end. The piece measures up to 35mm. No lesions are identified and the larger of the three pieces measure up to 180mm. There are suture at one end. On the cut sectioning, the second largest piece of fatty tissue contains a tan, firm nodule up to 10mm. This area was deep to the suture. 
(1-4 sections from the largest omentum; 5&6 the second largest piece [5 tumour nodule; 7&8 from the third largest piece, representative section; 9,10&11 from the smaller piece. One tumour block added which is the tumournodule). RS (M-11)
C. "LESION LIVER SEGMENT 7". Consists of a segment of liver, 35x25x15mm. The specimen weighs 7g. The resection margin was inked blue and the capsular margin was inked green. The specimen was cut into transverse pieces and revealed a firm, tan nodule which abuts the resection margin. The nodule measures 15x15x10mm. 
(1-3 contains sections through the nodule, the closest resection margin). RS (M-3/VY/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr D Laroque)  
A. Sections show dense fibrosis replacing adipose tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections through the second largest piece of adipose tissue with the suture show an extranodal deposit of moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma including areas of necrosis in keeping with origin from colorectal primary. The other pieces of adipose tissue show scattered reactive lymph nodes and otherwise no abnormalities.
C. Sections through the liver show metastatic moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma including areas of necrosis in keeping with origin from the colorectal primary. No lymphovascular invasion is seen. The adenocarcinoma is seen to extend to the capsular surface of the liver segment. The carcinoma also extends to the surgical margin of resection. Adjacent liver parenchyma shows moderate fatty change but otherwise no significant abnormality. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL BIOPSY: 
- FIBROSIS, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
OMENTUM, MESENTERIC NODULE, PERINEPHRIC FAT:
- METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING ADIPOSE TISSUE WITH SUTURE
 
LESION LIVER SEGMENT 7:
- METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA.
