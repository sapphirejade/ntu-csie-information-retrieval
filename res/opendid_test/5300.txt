AMENDED REPORT (29.3.66):

CLINICAL:
(L) Breast Ca - local excision and SLN bx.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary sentinel" consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue measuring 20 x 17 x 10mm.  There is a lymph node measuring 13mm.  Serially sectioned.  AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary sentinel node 2" consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 22 x 13mm with one lymph node 15mm diameter and a possible second node 3mm diameter.  
Blocks:  1 - 13mm lymph node serially sectioned AE; 2- small ?lymph node.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Excision short superior, medium medial, long lateral left breast wire guided" consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue measuring 57mm (medial to lateral), 50mm (superoinferior) and 35mm (superficial to deep).  The superficial aspect has been inked blue, the deep aspect black and the superior aspect red.  The specimen is serially sliced from lateral to medial into 8 slices.  In slices 5 to 7 there is a tumour measuring 10mm (superficial to deep), 10mm (superior to inferior) and 12mm (lateral to medial).  The tumour is 10mm from the superficial margin, 7mm from the deep margin, 15mm from the superior margin, 30mm from the inferior margin, 3mm from the medial margin and 10mm from the lateral margin.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - LS slice 1; 3, 4 & 5 - slice 2; 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 & 11 - slice 3; 12, 13, 14, 15 - slice 4; 16, 17,18, 19 - slice 5, 20, 21, 22, 23 - slice 6, 24, 25, 26 - slice 7; 27 & 28 - LS slice 8.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left breast new medial inferior margin, stitch margin" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with a stitch on one side measuring 50 x 40 x 20mm.  The stitch indicates the medial/inferior margin surface which is inked black.  Specimen serially sectioned AE 12 blocks.  (TO: JM:  HW/mm 23.3.66) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Sealock):
A to D.  Sections show a 15mm diameter grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma.   There is lymphovascular invasion.  All excision margins are free of tumour.  There is metastatic tumour in one sentinel node, and another sentinel node has isolated tumour cells.  A synoptic report follows:

Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS.
Invasive tumour size: 15mm 
Grade: 2 (Modified Bloom & Richardson)

Perineural invasion: Absent 

DCIS component:  
DCIS: Present. 
Maximum extent of DCIS: 13mm.
Nuclear grade:  Intermediate
Architecture: Solid, cribriform.
Necrosis:  Present. 
Calcification: Not identified. 
Degree of DCIS in tumour:  <5%.
DCIS in adjacent tissue: Absent.
Excision Margins (of main specimen, specimen C):  
Invasive and in-situ components:
Deep margin:  5mm 
Superficial margin: 5mm 
Inferior margin:  6mm.
Medial margin:  4mm
Superior lateral margins:  >10mm  
Receptors: (Block C21)
ER:   POSITIVE
	90% of nuclei stained
	Predominant intensity of staining: Strong.
PR:   POSITIVE
	5% of nuclei stained
	Predominant intensity of staining: Moderate.
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7):  1+  (regarded as negative)..
HER2 SISH:  Performed at Du Pont, CENTRAL HIGHLANDS RURAL HEALTH - KYNETON Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 immunoproliferative index: 20% of tumour cell nuclei positive. 

Nipple: Not included. 
LCIS / ALH: Not identified. 
Miscellaneous:The adjacent non-neoplastic breast tissue in the main specimen (specimen C) has one incidental benign lymph node.  The adjacent breast tissue is otherwise unremarkable.
Specimen D "new medial inferior margin" consists of benign glandular and fibroadipose breast tissue only. There is no evidence of malignancy.  This tissue also includes two unremarkable small lymph nodes. 
Sentinel lymph node(s): Specimens A and B.
Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 3
Number of sentinel lymph nodes involved by tumour: 2          
Number of sentinel nodes with metastases >2.0mm: 1   
Number of sentinel nodes with metastases <2.0mm:  0    
	
Number of sentinel nodes with isolated tumour cells <0.2mm:  1
          Detected by HE and IHC
Extranodal spread: Not present
Axillary/other nodes:
Number of axillary/other lymph nodes examined: 3 (in specimens C and D).
Number of axillary/other lymph nodes involved by tumour:  0         
Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined (including sentinel node(s)): 5  
Total number of involved lymph nodes (including sentinel node(s)): 2  
DIAGNOSIS:
A. to D.   Left breast excision and leftaxillary sentinel lymph nodes:  15mm diameter grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma.  Metastasis in one sentinel lymph node and isolated tumour cells in another sentinel lymph node (2/5).

AMENDED REPORT (29.3.66):
In the previous report it was incorrectly stated that the medial excision margin to the invasive carcinoma and DCIS in the main specimen (specimen C) is 8mm.  In fact it is around 4mm (report amended above).  However the separate specimen from the medial/inferior margin (specimen D) is free of tumour.
