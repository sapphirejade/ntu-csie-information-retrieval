HISTORY:  
Large right ovarian mass ?borderline mucinous.  Pelvic mass. Large amount of ascitic fluid.  (1) Right ovary and tube for frozen section.  
Uterus, left ovary and tube, appendix, pouch of Douglas peritoneum, omentum. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE". Enlarged ovary measuring 230x18x80mm and weighing 2230g. The specimen is fluctuant, with a semitranslucent smooth surface. The cut surface is multicystic with thick gelatinous straw colored cyst contents. No appreciable solid or papillary areas. Four pieces of tissue on two chucks for frozen section.
F/S: "Multicysticmucinous tumour with mostly flat benign epithelium, focal proliferative/low-grade border-line changes" per phone to Dr. Pohl at 9:35am on 08/02/65 by Dr. I. Dahnke.
The fallopian tube measures 75mm in length with diameter up to 7mm. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(1&2 frozen section; 3 longitudinal section of the fimbrial end; 4 transverse longitudinal section of the fallopian tube; 5-13 representative sections through the specimen, most of them are papillary looking areas embedded). RS (M-13/ SS/cy)
B.  "UTERUS + LEFT OVARY + TUBE".  A uterus with attached left ovary and tube.  The left ovary measuring 30x20x10mm.  On cut surface, there are corpus luteum, two cysts measuring 5x3mm, 2x3mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 50x10x30mm.  The uterus measures 100x60x40mm and the endometrium is 2mm, myometrium 14mm.  Anterior inked blue, posterior black.  The cut surface looks unremarkable.
(1&2 blank; 3&4 left ovary; 5 left fimbria; 6 left fallopian tube [TS x 2]; 7 anterior end of cervix; 8 posterior end of cervix; 9 anterior cervix; 10 posterior cervix; 11 anterior cervix [body]; 12 posterior cervix [body];13-15 fundus as per diagram; 16 fallopian tube/uterus left side; 17 fallopian/uterus right side; 18 parametrial tissue).  RS (M-18).
C.  "APPENDIX".  An appendix measuring 65x7x3mm, the meso attached measures 55x25mm.   Thewall of the appendix is 2mm.  
(1 two LS proximal; 2 LS distal; 3 three TS body).  RS (M-3).
D.  "POUCH OF DOUGLAS".  Oval shaped tissue measuring 20x15x5mm, cut into 10 pieces from one side to the other in transverse sections.  AE (M-2)
E.  "OMENTUM".  Tissue measuring 110x70x10mm.  RS (M-5/MM/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (I Arlia )
A. The ovarian tumour has been extensively sampled, and sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis or borderline mucinous tumour. The tumour is multicystic and of intestinal type. The proliferative activity is patchy and low-grade. There are no high-grade nuclear changes, or complex architecture. There are scattered foci of extravasated mucin with a prominent histiocytic inflammatory response. However, there is no evidence of invasive malignancy in the sections examined. There is no surface ovarian involvement. 
Immunohistochemical stains show that the mucinous tumour is positive for CK7 and CDX2 with patchy positive staining for CK20. This profile is in keeping with an ovarian primay.
Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable. 
B. Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. There is no evidence of squamous or glandular atypia. The endometrium shows weak proliferative changes. The myometrium is unremarkable. Sections of the left ovary and fallopian tube are within normal limits for age. 
C. Sections of the appendix show fibrous obliteration of the distal lumen. The proximal lumen is unremarkable. There is no evidence of mucinous change and no evidence of inflammation or malignancy. 
D. Sections show strips of peritoneum with mild mesothelial hyperplasia in association with adjacent organising mucin. No epithelium is identified within the mucin either on routine staining or on a panel of immunohistochemical stains (calretinin, HBME-1, EMA, HerAg, CEA, BerEP4, WT1). The appearances raise the possibility of previous rupture of the ovarian tumour.
 
E. Representative sections of the omentum show patchy foci of mild mesothelial hyperplasia in association with mild chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE

B. UTERUS AND CERVIX, LEFT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE
- PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM
- UNREMARKABLE CERVIX 
- UNREMARKABLE OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBES
C. APPENDIX
- FIBROUS OBLITERATION OF DISTAL LUMEN.
D. POUCH OF DOUGLAS
- PERITONEUM WITH ADJACENT ORGANISING EPITHELIAL FREE MUCIN.
E. OMENTUM
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
