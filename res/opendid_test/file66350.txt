Non-standard: Anterior superior - blue; Anterior inferior - green; Posterior - black.
DISSECTION:
Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION: The cut surface is fibrofatty. In the lower outer quadrant in the posterior half, there is a 4mm possible calcification.  This area is 12mm from the posterior margin.  No other focal lesions identified. No solid masses identified. This area is 12mm from the posterior margin.

(1 nipple; 2-3 composite blocks for calcification to deep margin; 4 lower outer quadrant deep [superior to calcification]; 5 lower outer quadrant anterior; 6-7 upper outer quadrant [7 two posterior margins]; 8-9 upper inner quadrant [9 with posterior margin]; 10-11 lower inner quadrant [11 with posterior margin]). Representative sections (M-11/AO 26/4/2071 cy)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. Y. Raposo)
Sections of the breast show benign ducts and lobules. The possibly calcifiied area seen macroscopically is a dilated duct containing inspissated secretions and surrounded by mild fibrosis and chronic inflammation. There is focal usual epithelial hyperplasia. There is no in situ or invasive malignancy.
