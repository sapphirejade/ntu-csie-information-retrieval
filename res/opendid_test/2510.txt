CLINICAL:
D/W Radiation Oncology registrar - hx of newly diagnosis sarcoma knee.  Rule out malignancy.  Specimen in saline - all for histo (MS 16.10.65).  US guided core biopsy, right breast, lower inner quadrant.  Chronic bilateral extracapsular silicone implant rupture.  Irregular mass in right breast.  Probable extracapsular silicone but exclude malignancy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast lower inner quadrant" consists of three core biopsies 10, 15 and 16mm in length.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast lower inner quadrant" consists of a core biopsy received in saline, 15mm in length.  AE 1block.  (TO: XI:  OS/mm 16.10.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by A/Prof R Cain and Dr R Cianfrani):
A and B show similar features and deeper levels have been examined. 
The core biopsies show fibroadipose connective tissue and glandular breast tissue. There is lipogranulomatous inflammation with admixed non-polarisable refractile crystalline material (consistent with silicone). 
The inflammation consistsof histiocytes, giant cells and a mixed lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate. There is coagulative type necrosis present within areas of cystic acellular tissue containing calcification. 
The background stroma is fibrotic. 
The features are of giant cell lymphohistiocytic inflammatory response and would be consistent withsilicone leakage.
There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast lower inner quadrant:
- Giant cell lymphohistiocytic inflammatory response to silicone leakage.
- No diagnostic evidence of malignancy.
