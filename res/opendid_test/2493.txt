MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 160g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 53 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 30mm inmaximum thickness.  Within the myometrium there are eight fibroids, 5 to 20mm; the largest fibroid at the fundus is 20 x 20 x15mm. Some of the fibroids have focal calcification area.  The endometrium appears to be unremarkable.  There is no obvious lesion or tumour within the endometrial cavity.  There is a pedunculated pale-white polyp, 10 x 7 x 2mm at the superior end of the endocervical canal (close to the internal os). There is an additional pedunculated pearl white cervical polyp, 6 x 6 x 6mm, close to the external os (5mm from the os/ectocervix).  The endocervical canal also contains thick mucoid material.  Apart from the polyps the endocervical mucosa appears to be normal.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm long and 3mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 3mm.  The sectioning of the right ovary shows small cystic area, 8 x 8 x 6mm (block 12 and 13). The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in long and 5mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 30 x 15mm.  The left ovarian cyst is multiloculated and contains clear fluid.  There are no papillary excrescences on the ovarian cyst wall.  The cyst wall is 1mm in thickness.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - Full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 9 and 10 - the largest cervical polyp close to the lower uterine segment; 11 - the smaller cervical polyp closed to the external os; 12 to 14 - right ovary AE; 15 - right fimbriae; 16 - right tube; 17 to 22 -left ovarian cyst, AE; 23 - left paraovarian soft tissue; 24 - fimbriae; 25 - left tube. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a firm omental fat 280 x 55 x 8mm.  There are no obvious tumour deposits or nodule, however the sectioning shows some irregular fibrosis of the omentum.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections.  (TO: SALVATORE;Kenny/vo 14.10.65). 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Doung)
A.  Sections of cervix show an endocervical polyp. The ectocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium shows cystic atrophy. The myometrium shows leiomyomas and adenomyosis. There are scattered foci of metastatic moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma, with associated psammomatous calcifications, involving the uterine serosa,bilateral ovarian and fallopian tube surfaces. The right fallopian tube fimbrial end is also involved and contains a focus of probable serous carcinoma-in-situ. Foci highly suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion are identified. 
B.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma. There are numerous psammomatous calcifications. 
COMMENT:
There is metastatic moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma involving the uterine serosa, bilateral ovarian and fallopian tube surfaces and omentum. The right fimbrial end is also involved by serous adenocarcinoma, with a focus suggestive of serous carcinoma-in-situ. Overall, the pattern of involvement favours probable primary peritoneal origin. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Uterus, cervix, ovaries and omentum: Serous adenocarcinoma involving the uterine serosa, surface of bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes, right fallopian tubefimbrial end and omentum.
