CLINICAL NOTES:
Serous endometrial ca.
1. Uterus, tubes, ovary.
2. Omental biopsy.
3. Left pelvic sentinel node.
4. Right pelvic sentinel node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus, cervix, attached tubes and ovaries 79g altogether. Right tube measures 60mm in length 5mm diameter. Paratubal and parafimbrial cysts present. There is a large paratubal cyst 20mm present filled with clear fluid. Right ovary measures 20x15x10mm. Sectioning unremarkable. Both tube and ovary embedded entirely. Left tube measures 50mm in length 5mm diameter. Paratubal cyst present. Left ovary measures 25x10x8mm. Sectioning is unremarkable. Both ovary and tube embedded entirely.
- Uterus measures 70x40x35mm. Anterior surface inked blue, posterior inked black and opened sagittally. Serially sliced sagittally and anterior wall measures 10mm, posterior wall measures 14mm. There is a pale endometrial lesion located in fundus and body towards right side measuring 20mm diameter. The tumour invades to a depth of 9mm out of 16mm myometrial thickness in this area. The tumour is macroscopically clear of the endocervix.  There is a small circumscribed intramural lesion (fibroid) 5mm present.
