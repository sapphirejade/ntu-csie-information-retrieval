Endometrial cancer in a polyp.
Additional information:   Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (Grade 1) arising in an endometrial polyp.  BRIGHAM & WOMEN'S HOSPITAL Pathology, specimen no: 99658-52OFX.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a previously opened and partly disrupted uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 196g in total.  The uterus measures 100x 80 x 35mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  There are three subserosal fibroids on the anterior serosa ranging from 10 x 5 x 5mm to 20 x 20 x 20mm.  There are four subserosal fibroids on the posterior serosa ranging from 10 x 5 x 5mm to 25 x17 x 10mm.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm long and 5mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 8mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm long and 5mmin diameter.  The left ovary measures 17 x 15 x 5mm.  There is no obvious endometrial polyp within the endometrial cavity.  On sectioning there are seven intramural fibroid within the anterior wall, ranging from 5 x 5 x 5mm to 30 x 25x 30mm.  The anterior myometrium is trabeculated.  There is no obvious endometrial thickening.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 13mm in maximum thickness where the wall is trabeculated.  Within the posterior myometrium there are thick intramural fibroids ranging from 2 x 2 x 2mm to 20 x 18 x 20mm.  The posterior myometrium is also trabeculated.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - anterior body and cervix; 6 & 7 - composite section, left anterior wall; 8 - left anterior wall; 9 & 10 - left anterior wall towards the cornu; 11 - right anterior wall; 12 - left fimbria end; 13 - left tube; 14 - left ovary; 15 to 18 - posterior body and cervix; 19 & 20 - right posterior wall; 21 & 22 - compositesection left posterior wall; 23 - left posterior wall; 24 - right fimbria end; 25 - right tube; 26 - right ovary.  (Alfonso/rt 12.1.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Kesek):
The ectocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endocervix shows a focus of endometriosis.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  Multiple leiomyomas are present within the myometrium as well as extensive adenomyosis.  Both fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality. The uterus is extensively sampled and no residual polyp or adenocarcinoma is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
-   Leiomyomas.  Extensive adenomyosis.
