A.  &amp;quot;LEFT BREAST LESION&amp;quot;.
SPECIMEN SIDE:  Left
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Excision
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  Yes, widespread calcification present in the mid portion of the specimen, mostly located in F4, G7, F7. Inked yellow
HOOKWIRE:  Yes, hookwire split located around H6, inked yellow.

OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:
MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green (loop suture located anteriorly, inked yellow)
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral.
Number of slices: 7

(1-3 slice 1; 4&amp;amp;5 slice 2; 6&amp;amp;7 slice 3; 8&amp;amp;9 slice 4; 10 slice 5; 11 slice 6; 12&amp;amp;13 slice 7).  AE (M-13)
B.  &amp;quot;RETROALVEOLAR BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Fibrofatty tissue 5x5x3mm.  AE (1-1/SM 28/2/2067 nh)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr T Gatrell)
A. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):

Size:		Approximately 30mm
Nuclear grade:	Intermediate grade
Architecture: 	Solid
Necrosis: 		Present
Calcification: 	Present

EXCISION MARGINS:  DCIS extends to within 0.1mm from the posterior margin across a 3mm front (block 9), 0.2mm from the superior margin (block 9), 0.5mm from the anterior margin (block 4), 1mm from the medial margin and at least 8mm from all other margins.  A single duct of diathermied DCIS lies 3mm from the sutured nipple area of the biopsy.

OTHER:
Paget&amp;apos;s disease: 		Not assessed
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): 	Not identified
Non-neoplastic breast: 	Fibrocystic change with a small fibroadenomatoid nodule
ER/PR (Immuno method): 	To follow

COMMENT:   A large core biopsy/mammatome biopsy site is present in the specimen.  No invasion is identified.

B. Histology shows a further piece of fibrotic breast parenchyma which contains further 4mm of intermediate grade DCIS which focally lies 0.3mm from inked margins.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  LEFT BREAST LESION -
-  30mm OF INTERMEDIATE GRADE DCIS WITH VERY CLOSE MARGINS
B.  RETROAREOLAR BIOPSY -  4mm DCIS WITH CLOSE MARGIN
