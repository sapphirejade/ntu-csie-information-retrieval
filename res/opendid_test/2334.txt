CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma of the cervix.  Cervical cancer.  Obesity.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 216g.  The uterus measures 120 x 70 x 35mm and has a smooth, shiny serosalsurface.  The ectocervix measures 55 x 35mm and posteriorly there is an ulcerated area measuring 17 x 20mm.  Anteriorly, the ectocervix appears bulbous throughout.  There is a vaginal cuff anteriorly measuring 50 x 15mm and posteriorly the vaginal cuff appears disrupted and measures 40 x 20mm.  The anterior soft tissue cervical margin is inked blue and the posterior cervical soft tissue margin is inked black.  The cut surface reveals a cream, relatively well-circumscribed tumour in the area of ulceration measuring 16 x 12mm to a maximum depth of 10mm over a total wall thickness of 21mm.  The tumour is well clear of the vaginal cuff margin and 11mm from the soft tissue resection margin.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The right ovary measures 30 x 22 x 18mm and shows several haemorrhagic cystic areas up to 10mm in maximum dimension.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 20 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.:  1 to 20 - anterior cervix AE from right to left (paired blocks 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14, 15 & 16, 17 & 18); 21 to 24 - anterior endometrium (paired blocks 22 & 23); 25 to 43 - posterior cervix AE from right to left (paired blocks 30 & 31, 32 & 33, 34 & 35, 36 & 37, 38 & 39, 40 & 41); 44 to 47 - posterior uterus; 48 - right tube; 49 & 50 - right ovary; 51 - left tube; 52 - left ovary.  Please refer to attached diagram.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of fatty tissue up to 60mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5 to 25mm in length.
Blocks:  1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of three pieces of fatty tissue 5 to 10mm in maximum dimension.  No definite lymph nodes are identified.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of three pieces of fatty tissue 12 to 20mm across.  One lymph node is identified measuring 20mm in length.  Lymph node is serially sectioned and AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of fatty tissue from 5 to 70mm in maximum dimension.  Two lymph nodes are identified 20 and 22mm in length.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned.
F.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of three pieces of fatty tissue 8 to 20mm across.  Two possible lymph nodes are identified each 10mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a fatty piece of tissue 22mm in maximum dimension.  One lymph node is identified measuring 20mm in length.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block.  (TO: FZ; VG/rt 3.4.65)


MICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr P Tolly):
A. The sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma at the squamo-columnar junction of the cervix. There is adjacent severe dysplasia / CIN 3 / HSIL and invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma which cytologically resemble the cells in CIN 3.  Immunoperoxidase stains on the biopsy specimen (51Q75720 on 17/2/2065) show differentiationconsistent with adenosquamous carcinoma. The tumour invades to a depth of 8mm and is 15mm from the deep margin in thisarea including fatty tissue 2mm thick.  No lymphovascular or perineural spread is seen. The tumour measures up to 12mm across in microscopic sections (superior to inferior dimension) and is up to 16mm wide (macroscopic, medial to lateral).  The tumour is clear of the vaginal margin (> 20mm).
The cervix otherwise shows Nabothian cyst formation, mild chronic inflammation and areas of tubal metaplasia.  The endometrium is in mid proliferative phase. The myometrium shows adenomyosis.
The fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. The ovaries show mesothelial inclusion cysts, primordial and developing follicles, corpus haemorrhagicum and corpora albicantes.  There is no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia in the ovary or fallopian tube.
B. The sections show three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
C. The sections show fatty tissue containing two small lymph nodes partly replaced by fat. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D. The sections show a lymph node with sinus histiocytosis and partial fatty replacement.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E. The sections show two lymph nodes mainly replaced by fat.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F. The sections show three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
G. The sections show one lymph node largely replaced by fat.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
CONCLUSION
A. Uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix:  CIN 3 / severe dysplasia, poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma; invasive carcinoma is 16mm across and invades to a depth of 8mm in a wall 21mm thick, no lymphovascular or perineural invasion.
B. Right external iliac lymph nodes: No malignancy in three lymph nodes.
C. Right obturator lymph node: No malignancy in two lymph nodes.
D. Right common iliac lymph node: No malignancy in one lymph node.
E. Left external iliac lymph nodes: No malignancy in two lymph nodes.
F. Left obturator lymph nodes: No malignancy in three lymph nodes.
G. Left common iliac lymph node: No malignancy in one lymph node.
