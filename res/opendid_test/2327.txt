Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Borderline serous with non invasive implants.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "?Abdominal wall mass" consists of an unorientated piece of soft tissue 110 x 100 x 55mm.  At the superficial aspect there is an elliptical piece of skin 105 x 32mm.  There are no lesions on the skin surface.  There is a skeletal muscle on part of the margin.  The specimen has been incised through prior to reception exposing a unilocular cyst measuring approximately 50 x 35 x 20mm.  There are papillary excrescences on the inner surface of the cyst.  The resection margin is inked green.  The cyst abuts the skeletal muscle and is 6mm from the closest inked margin towards the deep aspect.  There are no solid nodules outside the cyst within the subcutaneous fatty tissue.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - cyst wall and the closest inked deep margin; 3 to 5 - representative sections of the cyst (5 - reserved block); 6 & 7- friable solid material within the cyst; 8 - random section of the skin.
B.  Specimen labelled "Retroperitoneal nodule" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40 x 15 x 10mm.  On slicing there is a focally indurated area 6 x 2 x 2mm (?fat necrosis).  There is also a pale solid nodule 7 x 2 x 2mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - AE (1 - includes the area of ?fat necrosis); 2 - includes the 7mm nodule.  AE.
C.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic nodule #2" consists of a piece of tan solid tissue 25 x 10 x 9mm.  BAE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic mass" consists of two ragged pieces of red and yellow solid tissue 60 x 37 x 10mm in aggregate.  Slicing reveals pale solid and yellow fatty cut surfaces.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - representatives.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 42 x 32 x 11mm.  Specimen is sliced.  No nodule is identified.
Blocks:  1 to3 - representatives.  (OM/rt 16.6.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Andelman & registrar Dr R Sidles):
A.  Sections show a large amount of high grade borderline serous tumour situated within the deep soft tissue abutting underlying skeletal muscle.  The amount of tumour together with location makes an implant unlikely.  The resection margins appear clear of tumour.
B.  Sections show non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour.
C.  Sections show dense fibrous adhesions containing occasional psammomatous calcification.  A focus of endosalpingiosis is seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour.
E.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - E.  Abdominal wall, retroperitoneal and pelvic nodules, omentum:
- High grade borderline serous tumour within the abdominal wall, margins clear.
- Non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour within retroperitoneum and pelvic mass.
- Omentum negative.
