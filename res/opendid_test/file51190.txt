FINDINGS / LESION:  There is a pale white lesion identified in slices 3-7.  It measures 20mm medial to lateral x 15mm superior to inferior x 10mm anterior to posterior. The lesion is &amp;lt;1mm from anterior margin, &amp;lt;1mm from inferior margin, 5mm from posterior and 10mm from superior.  It is 10mm from medial and 20mm from lateral margins.  It underlies the loop/nipple margin which was inked yellow.  Entire specimen embedded.

EXCISION MARGINS
INVASIVE TUMOUR MARGINS: Invasive carcinoma extends to focally involve the antero-inferior margin over an area approximately 0.5mm wide (Block 7). Invasive carcinoma lies less than 0.5mm from the nipple margin on the antero-inferior surface marked with the looped suture (block 4) but is well clear of all other margins (greater than 10mm).
&amp;#160;
DCIS MARGINS:
DCIS focally extends to within less than 0.5mm of the antero-inferior margin with an adjacent diathermied atypical duct on this margin - best considered focally involved (single duct block  6, DLS). This focus lies adjacent to the nipple marking suture. There is less than 0.5mm to the superior margin focally (single duct, Block 6), with 0.5mm to the posterior margin (Block 7) and greater than 8mm to all other margins.
