HISTORY:  
GI endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
Uterus tubes, ovaries, omental biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "UTERUS TUBES AND OVARIES". Received partially opened a total hysterectomy specimen of a total weight of 65g. Consists of an uterus, 75x40x30mm. The attached cervix measures 30x25x20mm, the attached adnexal structures are the right fallopian tube, 55x6mm; right ovary, 32x15x6mm left fallopian tube; 55x5m and left ovary, 25x14x7mm. The serosal surface is smooth and tan in colour. Anterior cervix is inked blue, posterior is inkedblack. The body of the anterior endometrium There is a partially endophytic and partially exophytic  polypoid firm tan lesion, measuring 24x18x 13mm, appears to be invading into the myometrium to a depth of 4mm out of 19 mm (macroscopically). The uninvolved endometrium is up to 3mm thick. The tumour is confined to the uterus. There is no cervical involvement. The tumour is 40 mm of the inferior surgical margin, 17mm from the nearest fundic serosa, 24mm from the right and 27mm from the left cornu. 
(1 right fallopian tube [two LS fimbrial end, one TS mid]; 2 two TS right ovary and base of right tube; 3 left tube, two LS fimbrial end, one TS mid; 4 left ovary two TS and one TS base of tube; 5&6 continuous piece [5 anterior cervix; 6 anterior body with a start of the tumour]; 7&8 maximum invasion of tumour into myometrium [anterior body]; 9 posterior cervix; 10 posterior body; 11 fundus[includes part of tumour ]; 12 fibroid).RS (M-12) (Further blocks; 13 right parametrium 14 left parametrium 15&16 each one LS cervix [completion of blocks 7&8]; 17 LS tumour anterior body) RS (M-17/ZY) 
B. "OMENTAL BIOPSY". Multiple fatty pieces of tissue, 19x15x5mm. AE (M-1/ZR/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (DR F Prudhomme) 
Specimen A:
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA: 
Tumour type: Endometrioid (with mucinous and secretory change)
FIGO grade: 2
(architecture grade: 2, nuclear grade: 2)
Myometrial invasion: Invasion limited to inner half of myometrium 
Depth of myometrial invasion: 4mm
Myometrial thickness: 16mm
Focality: Unifocal
Tumour involves:  Fundus, Body
Vascular/lymphatic invasion:  Not seen
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Involvement of uterine serosa:  No
Excision margins:  
Carcinoma is well clear of cervical surgical margins. 
Non-tumour uterus:  
Adjacent endometrium:  Simple hyperplasia
Adenomyosis: Focal. 
Adnexae:  
Left fallopian tube:  Unremarkable
Right fallopian tube:  Unremarkable
Left ovary:  Serous inclusions
Right ovary:  Unremarkable
Lymph nodes:  Not received
Other tissues:  Specimen B (Omentum) - unremarkable
Comment:  There is a small benign leiomyoma of the uterus. 

Pathologic Staging (AJCC/UICC TNM 7, FIGO 2008):

TNM stage:  pT1a, pNx, pMx
FIGO stage: 1A
DIAGNOSIS:  
UTERUS: ENDOMETRIOID ENDOMETRIAL ADENOCARCINOMA (GRADE 2).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Immunostains for MSI proteins (Dell ST MARGARETS REHABILITATION CENTRE Lab; block:  A7)
MLH1: Absent staining
PMS2: Absent staining
MSH2: Positive staining present
MSH6: Positive staining present
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
