CLINICAL:
Total gastrectomy + omentum and spleen.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Stomach, spleen and oesophagus" consists of a total gastrectomy specimen with attached spleen.  The total gastrectomy specimen measures 210mm in length, consisting of 10mmportion of oesophagus, in continuum 200mm of stomach.  The spleen measures 110 x 80 x 40mm and weighs 223.1g.  Omentum of greater curvature measures up to 200mm and the omentum of lesser curvature measures up to 50mm The radial margin is inked black and the proximal resection margin is inked blue.  The distal resection margin is inked black.  At the gastro oesophageal junction there is small prominent nodule measuring 12 x 10 x 4mm.  The rest of the mucosa  shows predominant normal ruggae  and small area of mucosal flattening.  No polyps or other lesion is seen.   Cut surface of the spleen is unremarkable.  .  
Blocks:  1 to 25 - gastro oesophageal junction including the proximal resection margin with the nodule described (6 to 9 - slices with the nodule); 26 & 27 representative section of the flattened mucosa area; 28 - representative sections of normal; 29 - representative sections of distal resection margin. 30 & 31 - representative sections of spleen; 32 - one probable lymph node; 33 - one lymph node bisected; 34 to 40 - fat.  (TO: AK; FZ/rt 9.5.66) Please see diagram
Further tissue: 41- 4 probale lymph nodes, 42-58 Rs of fat
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Ralon):

Tumour site: Gastro-oesophageal junction
Tumour type: Adenocarcinoma
Histological grade: Grade3, poorly differentiated 
Size of tumour:  21mm (microscopic)
Level of invasion: 
  T2	Tumour invades muscularis propria (block 10)
Invasion beyond the muscularis propria: Not seen
Serosal surface involvement: Not seen
Vascular space invasion
Small vessel invasion:  multifocal lymphovascular invasion present
Large vessel invasion: Not seen
Perineural growth:  Not seen
Degree of regression after preoperative chemoradiation (AJCC, 7th Ed.):
2 (minimal response, residual tumour outgrown by fibrosis)
Distance of tumour from margins
From proximal: 1.2mm (block 10)
From distal:  > 100mm
From radial: 5.5mm (block 6)
Lymph nodes
Regional lymph nodes
Number received: 20
Number involved: 0
Other pathologies
Inflammation: chronic inflammation present in gastric cardia and antrum
Helicobacter infection: negative on immunohistochemistry
Intestinal metaplasia/Barrettmucosa: not seen on ABPAS staining 
Dysplasia: Present, focal high grade in gastric cardia (block 10)
Spleen is unremarkable.
Ancillary tests
HER2 immunohistochemistry:  2+
Staging (AJCC, 7th Ed.)
ypT2 	Tumour invades muscularis propria
N0 	No regional lymph node metastasis
MX 	Cannot be assessed histologically

DIAGNOSIS
Stomach, oesophagus and spleen post treatment:
	21mm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ofthe gastro-oesophageal junction, invasion into muscularis propria (ypT2)
	20 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (N0)
