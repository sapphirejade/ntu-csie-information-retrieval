CLINICAL NOTES:
Low grade appendix tumour, small bowel, part of ureter, peritoneal tumour.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Multiple pieces of tissue fragments including portion of small bowel measuring 40x40x20mm.  It appears to be irregular ragged and opened.  There is a staple line on both ends 30mm in length each.  The other pieces measure 50x30x30mm in aggregate.  Small bowel mucosa appears unremarkable.  Staple line removed 2mm from the margin and inked blue.  There is a separate portion of fatty tissue ?mesenteric tissue with a cystic mucinous lesion approximately 30mm in maximum dimension.
(1  two sections from stapled margin; 2-5  sections of the lesion; 6  RS from the small bowel).  RS (M-6).

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT URETER&amp;quot;.  A portion of ureter 22mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  No obvious tumour deposit on the serosa.  No obvious tumour inside the ureter identified.

(1  two sections from both ends; 2  four sections from middle).  AE (6-2/SM 17/5/2069 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr N Mayorca)
A. Sections show fibroadipose tissue infiltrated by large pools of mucin. Some are partially lined by cuboidal to columnar mucinous epithelium with low grade atypia. Occasional isolated groups of the same epithelium are floating within the mucinous pools. The features are in keeping with the clinical history of low grade mucinous neoplasm.
Sections of small bowel are unremarkable, with no epithelial dysplasia or malignancy. One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.

B. Sections of ureter show acute on chronic inflammation with occasional lymphoid aggregates. There is no in situ or invasive malignancy.

SUMMARY:
A. SMALL BOWEL -
- FEATURES IN KEEPING WITH LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM INVOLVING FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.
B. RIGHT URETER - ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.
