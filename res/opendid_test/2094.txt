CLINICAL:
(L) Adrenal tumour.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left adrenal tumour" consists of a 70 x 60 x 50mm mass with yellow external surface and attached scant fatty tissue weighing 92g.  Slicing reveals yellow/orange solid cut surfaces with focal haemorrhage.  There is an incomplete rim of adrenal gland at the periphery.  
Blocks:  1 to 7 - representatives (block 1 - reserve block).  
(TO: XK:  NA/mm 6.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Steube): 
Sections show adrenal with an associated fatty tumour.  The adipocytes show moderate variation and size and shape but no lipoblasts are identified.  Throughout the tumour there are scattered small cells with hyperchromatic round nuclei; these are singly dispersed and in small clusters and are consistent with erythroid precursors.  Focally there is haemopoietic tissue which includes erythroid and myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes.  There are scattered small foci of calcification and ossification through the tumour.  Essentially normal adrenal cortical tissue is compressed at one edge of the tumour.  
There is no significant atypia and there is no evidence of malignancy.  The appearances are most consistent with an adrenal myelolipoma.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Left adrenal tumour:  Myelolipoma.
