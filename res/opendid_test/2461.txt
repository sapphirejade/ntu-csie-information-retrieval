A.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 15 x 14 x 7mm containing a single lymph node measuring 13 x 8 x 5mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  The lymph node is bisected AE 1 block.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:

Result to Dr Erin by Dr N Levins at 18:05 on 24/06/65.  
C .Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and right ovary and weighing 320g in total.  It is received partially opened.  The uterus measures 160 x 90 x 60mm with a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 60 x 50mm and appears slightly bulky in the anterior and posterior but no gross tumour is seen on sectioning.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness.  In the posterior half of the uterine body there are two endometrial polyps measuring 25 x 10 x 10mm and 10 x 7 x 10mm.On sectioning, myometrium of posterior body measures up to 30mm.  The cut surface shows two fibroids, one within the myometrium and one sub serosal measuring from 10 to 30mm.  
Four sections for frozen section. On sectioning of anterior myometrium  there is a single foci of fibroid measuring up to 6mm and some areas which appear cystic measuring up to 10mm.  Thefallopian tube measures 45mm in length with an outer diameter of 8mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable with a single unilocular fimbrial cyst with a wall thickness up to 1mm.  The inner surface is smooth with no papillary excrescences.  The ovary measures 25 x 18 x 10mm.  The cut surface is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - base of larger polyp; 2 - frozen section ofouter half of myometrium; 3 - frozen section posterior ectocervix; 4 - frozen section adjacent to endocervix; 5 & 6 - deep tissue corresponding to C4 (the serosal surface); 7 to 14 - LS anterior body and cervix; 15 - two areas of fibroid; 16 to 36 - anterior cervix from left to right (block 16 to18 - one slice each; 19 & 20 - one slice; 21 & 22 - one slice; 23 & 24 - one slice25 - one slice; 26 & 27 - one slice; 28 & 29 - one slice; 30 & 31 - one slice; 32 - one slice; 33 - one slice; 34 - one slice; 35 - one slice; 36 - one slice); 37 to 40 - RS of cystic areas in the anterior myometrium; 41 to 43 - RS fallopian tube (43 - RS fallopian tube with fimbrial cyst); 44  - two RS ovaries; 45 to 51 - large polyp (47 & 48 - one slice; 49 & 50 - one slice); 52 to 59 - smaller polyp; 60 & 61 - RS fibroids from posterior body; 62 to 72 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (block 67 & 68 - one slice; 69 & 70 - one slice); 73 to 83 - posterior cervix from left to right. 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
NB: Discussion with Dr Eugenio:  grossly endometrial polyp plus cervix with no obvious carcinoma.Would still prefer a frozen section done.  

There is no evidence of carcinoma. 
Result to Dr Aurelio by Dr N Ueki at 19:20 on 24/06/65.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic node" consists of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 10mm.  No lymph nodes are identified.   AE 1 block.    
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left iliac lymph node" consists of a single fatty tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 10mm.  One lymph node is identified measuring up to 35mm.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node sliced into seven slices.   (TO: XV; EB/ta 25/6/65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr N Helley):
A.  Sections show a lymph node with reactive type changes.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections of the ovary show features of a fibro-thecoma.  Nests and singly disposed thecoma cells are seen within a prominent fibromatous background.  Occasional clusters of hyperplastic Leydig cells are also present.  There are no atypical features.  Mitotic figures are up to 2/10 HPF.  No necrosis can be seen.  Multiple benign serous cysts are identified at the periphery.  There is no intracellular mucin on PASD stain.
Sections of the fallopian tube show focal luminal dilatation, reduced and fibrotic plicae, and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, suggestive of hydrosalpinx.  The tube otherwise appears unremarkable.
C.  Sections of the uterus confirm two endometrial polyps undergone hyperplastic changes with focal areas of nuclear atypia.  The hyperplasia ranges in morphology from simple to complex with transitional merging of the two architectural patterns.  The glands show moderate irregularity and branching with intervening stroma preserved.  Focal areas demonstrate nuclear atypia marked by nuclear enlargement, coarse chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.  There are no features suggestive of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
The hyperplasia extends to the base pf the polyps and focally to the non-polypoid adjacent endometrium.  The residual endometrium is mainly composed of inactive type glands.
Multiple transmural fibroids can be seen with no atypical features.  The non-involved myometrium also shows evidence of adenomyosis and a focus of benign adenomatoid tumour.
The entire cervix has been embedded.  Sections show simple nabothian cysts.  There is no evidence of CIN, significant glandular dysplasia or malignancy.
The right ovary and fallopian tube show no significant abnormality.
D.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue only.
E.  Sections show a lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
Selective slides shown to Dr N Bercher who concurs.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left external iliac lymph node:  One lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Left tube and ovary:  Fibro-thecoma and benign serous cysts.
C.  Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary:  
-  Endometrial simple and complex hyperplasia with focal atypia, arising in endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrium.
-  Fibroids, adenomyosis, and focal adenomatoid tumour.
-  Cervix, right ovary and fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality.
D.  Right pelvic node:  Fibroadipose tissue only.
E.  Left iliac lymph node:  One lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
