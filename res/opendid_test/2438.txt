CLINICAL:
BRCA risk reducing surgery. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes & ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 52g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 22mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.  Themyometrium is unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 22 x 8mm and contains a possible unilocular cyst 20 x 15 x 3mm.  (This area might be an ovarian cyst or soft tissue loosely attached to the ovary).  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 12 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix;  4-6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7-10 - entire right ovary; 11-13 - entire right fallopian tube; 14 & 15 - entire left ovary; 16-18 - entire left fallopian tube.   (TO: QP/ec   1.10.65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Rayborn):
Sections of the uterus show inactive endometrium and focal adenomyosis.  There are no features of hyperplasia or malignancy.  The cervix contains focal tunnel clusters and benign nabothian cysts and otherwise appears unremarkable.  
The ovaries and fallopian tubes have been sectioned and blocked entirely as per protocol.  There is nosignificant abnormality in the uterine adnexa.  No evidence of malignancy is identified.
DIAGNOSIS: 
Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes & ovaries:
	Inactive endometrium.
	Adenomyosis.
No significant abnormality in the cervix, ovaries and tubes.
