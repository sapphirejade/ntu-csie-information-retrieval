MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;COLON, DUODENUM, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Multiple tissue fragments in the same jar.

Portion of small bowel probably duodenum/jejunum with length of 130mm and 45mm maximum circumference.  Attached fatty tissue to the outer surface of the duodenum 80x50mm.  Peritoneal margin inked black and adhesion margin inked blue.
Sectioning of the adhesive tissue shows stellate fairly circumscribed tumour invade into the small bowel wall.  Mucosa of small bowel appears intact. Tumour is clear from the margin 2mm at closest. Multiple tumour deposits/possible involved lymph nodes identified.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. W Orabone)
A.  Sections of small bowel show infiltrating moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumour extends into the fatty mesentery and focally abuts the free serosal surface.  It encroaches onto the adjacent lymph node.  Multiple foci of perineural and lymphovascular invasion are noted.  The overlying small bowel mucosa appears unremarkable.
The large bowel mesentery shows multiple foci of fat necrosis and fibrous scarring.  Two lymph nodes are identified and these show no evidence of metastatic tumour.  The large bowel mucosa appears unremarkable.
Sections from the rectum show unremarkable mucosa.  Within the fatty mesentery, fibrous scarring is identified.  No evidence of tumour.
Sections of gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis.  The cystic duct lymph node shows scattered lipogranulomas.  No evidence of tumour.
Further sections of the small bowel tumour  uninvolved pancreatic tissue at one edge.  One focus shows atypical epithelium beneath the small bowel mucosa.
Metastatic carcinoma and involvement by carcinoma by direct extension are present in 3 out of 21 lymph nodes identified.
Immunohistochemistry stains show positive staining of the tumour for cytokeratin 19 and CEA.  Focal positive staining for CK7, CK20 and CD2 are noted.  ER/PR, TTF-1, p16, WT1 and PAX8 are negative.
Comment:  Sections show moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving submucosal small bowel extending to the edge of the pancreas.  There is extensive perineural involvement and the appearances favour adenocarcinoma from upper GI tract origin including ampullary, cholangiocarcinoma from biliary tract, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
B.  Sections show liver.  The architecture is slightly distorted with nodular appearance.  There is haemorrhage within the portal tracts.  Mild macro and microvesicular steatosis is identified. No evidence of invasive malignancy.

C.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in a lymph node identified
D.  Sections show lymph node.  Occasional lipogranulomas are identified.  No evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  COLON, DUODENUM, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- ADENOCARCINOMA, FAVOUR UPPER GI TRACT ORIGIN (AMPULLARY, BILIARY, AND PANCREAS)

B.  SEGMENT VI LIVER:  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY

C.  PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE:  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN ONE NODE

D.  STATION 8:  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN ONE NODE
