CLINICAL NOTES:
Colon cancer with peritoneal mets.
Abdominal wall for frozen section. ?malignancy ?fibrosis.
Recurrent colon Ca with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
1. Bilateral ovaries, omentum, gallbladder x peritoneal disease.
2. Common hepatic artery lymph node.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UMBILICAL WOUND&amp;quot;. A piece of fibrofatty tissue, 50x25x8mm. Representative sections examined.

F/S: &amp;quot;Fibrosis tissue. No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot; per phone to fellow at 12pm on 18/02/71 by Dr. F. Soplop.

(1 frozen; 2-5 remainder tissue). AE (M-5)

B. &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, LEFT OVARY, RIGHT OVARY, OMENTUM, RIGHT PERITONEUM&amp;quot;. Received in one specimen jar multiple tissue fragments including a gallbladder, 75x20mm. The outer surface is ragged and haemorrhagic at the fundus. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosal surfaces are green and granular. No calculi are identified.

(1 cystic duct, TS neck and TS body; 2 three LS fundus, ragged serosa).

A fallopian tube, 42x8mm, with attached partially cystic ovary, 50x25x20mm, weighing 20mm in aggregate. Possible mucinous material is identified on the fallopian tube serosa. The ovarian cut surface reveals a unilocular cyst with a smooth inner lining filled with clear serous fluid, measuring 30x17x15mm. The adjacent ovarian parenchyma is variegated with occasional corpus luteum and haemorrhagic foci.

(3 fallopian tube, two LS fimbrial end and two TS mid; 4-6 representative ovary).

A fallopian tube, 50x10mm, with an adherent cystic mass, 160x130x100mm. The cystic lesion weighs 1145g. Three defective areas are identified on the outer surface, 25x20mm, 35x30mm, and 15x10mm. The outer surface away from the defective area is smooth and lobular. The ovarian cut surface reveals multilocular cystic lesion with solid and necrotic area comprising about 40% of the total mass size.

(7 fimbrial tube, two LS, with edge of the cystic lesion; 8 TS tube with underlying ovarian cyst; 9-11 representative ovarian tumour, solid areas; 9 and 10 including the defect [9 tumour block for tumour banking]).

A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum, 300x90x50mm. No definite lesions are identified. Ill-defined firm areas were sampled.
(12 and 13 omentum.)

Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue, 120x80x20mm, in aggregate. They are covered by peritoneum. It has ragged, haemorrhagic surface. A possible tubular structure ?vessel is identified.

(14 and 15 representative). RS (M-15)

C. &amp;quot;COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY&amp;quot;. Three lymph nodes, 14x5x3mm, 20x14x8mm, and 20x12x6mm.

(1 smaller lymph node, trisected; 2 one lymph node, serially sliced; 3 one lymph node, serially sliced). AE (M-3/ZH 19/2/2070 cy)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr F Diruzzo)
A.  The paraffin sections confirm fatty tissue in which there are areas of dense fibrosis consistent with scar.  Negative for malignancy.
B.  Sections of the gallbladder are unremarkable.
Sections of the first described ovary and fallopian tube ovary with multiple follicular cysts and unremarkable appearing fallopian tube.
Sections of the next described fallopian tube and ovary with associated multicystic mass demonstrate normal appearing fallopian tube and the ovarian cystic mass shows multiloculation with broad areas of necrosis.  The cystic spaces are lined by columnar epithelium with multilayering, cribriform architecture, prominent mitotic activity and nuclear hyperchromasia and nuclear membrane irregularity.  Focal areas of infiltrative pattern glands with high grade cytology within fibrotic and desmoplastic stroma are identified. Immunohistochemistry (Block B8) shows positive staining for CDX-2; patchy positive staining for CK20; and negative staining of both CK7 and PAX-8. The appearances are consistent with the given history of colorectal carcinoma.
Sections of the omentum are unremarkable and four omental lymph nodes show reactive changes only.
Sections of the separate piece of fibrofatty tissue are unremarkable.
C.  Three lymph nodes are identified and show reactive changes only.
COMMENT: Clinical correlation is recommended.

A.  UMBILICAL WOUND -
-FIBROSIS CONSISTENT WITH SCAR.
B.  GALLBLADDER, LEFT OVARY, RIGHT OVARY, OMENTUM, OMENTUM, RIGHT PERITONEUM -
-ADENOCARCINOMA - SEE TEXT FOR DETAILS
C.  COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY -
-THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
