*** AMENDED REPORT (2.10.2066) ***
Specimens B and C were received incorrectly labelled as "Right external iliac lymph node" and "Left external iliac lymph node", respectively.  Following clarification by Dr S Landvatter, the labels have been correctedin the report to "Right pelvic lymph node" and "Left pelvic lymph node", respectively.


CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  GORD.  Obesity.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 146g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 150 x 65 x 40mm.  The ectocervix is 28 x 28mm.  Over the fundal aspect of the endometrial cavity is a polypoidal lesion, 25 x 20 x 5mm.  The tumour involves both the anterior and posterior uterine walls.  The tumour appears to infiltrate into themyometrium by a depth of 5mm through a total myometrial thickness of 20mm.  There is a 5mm intramural fibroid.  The left fallopian tube is 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary is 25 x 20 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube is 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary is 25 x 15 x 8mm.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6 to 8 - further sections anterior tumour; 9 to 12 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 13 - intramural fibroid; 14 - left fallopian tube and ovary; 15 - right fallopian tube and ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 100 x 60x 20mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, 3 to 35mm across.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one lymph node; 3 & 4 - one lymph node; 5 to 7 - one lymph node in each block; 8 & 9 - multiple lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 70 x 50 x 30mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, 4 to 40mm across.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one lymph node; 3 & 4 - one lymph node; 5 & 6 - one lymph node in each block; 7 & 8 - multiple lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy"consists of a piece of omentum 80 x 45 x 20mm.  No focal lesions are seen.  RS in 3 blocks.   (TO: KY; CB/rt 2.4.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Saltness):
A.  The sections show a Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma ofthe endometrium.  The tumour invades into the myometrium to a depth of 8mm through a wall thickness of 18mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved by tumour, and show no significant abnormality.  A leiomyoma is confirmed in the myometrium.  Both the fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining (patchy weak positive staining)
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B.  The sections show ten lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/10).
C.  The sections show ten lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/10).
D.  The sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative sections seen with Dr S Baucum.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes andovaries:  Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
B.  Right pelvic lymph nodes:  Ten negative lymph nodes (0/10).
C.  Left pelvic lymph nodes:  Ten negative lymph nodes (0/10).
D.  Omental biopsy:  No significant abnormality.
