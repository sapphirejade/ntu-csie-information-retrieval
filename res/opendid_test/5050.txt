CLINICAL:
Microinvasive SCC.  Posterior vulva, stitch at anterior margin.  (Orientation is further clarified with Dr G Penman (at 11.15am, 17/06/65):  The suture marks the anterior most margin of the specimen.  Opening of the urethra is posterior to the suture).  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva stitch at anterior margin" consists of a "butterfly" shaped vulvectomy specimen, 93 x 90 x 25mm.  The right lateral side on the bigger wing of the "butterfly" is inked black and the remaining margins are inked blue.  No urethral opening is seen.  On the skin surface there is an ill defined paler flat area 45 x 30mm.  Specimen is transversely sliced and sequentially blocked from anterior towards posterior.  
Blocks:  1 to 19 - anterior, larger wing (blocks 1 - to anterior margin; 2 to 4 - each one sliced; 5 & 6 - one slice; 7 & 8 - one slice; 9 & 10 - one slice; 11 to 13 - one slice; 14 to 17 - one slice; 18 - trimmed off block 14; 19 - trimmed off 15); 20 & 21 - soft tissue overhanging, posterior introitus margin (block 21 - one slice); 22 to 27 - one slice; 28 - trimmed off 23; 29 to 33 - one slice; 34 to 41 - one slice; 42 to 47 - one slice; 48 & 49 - one slice; 50 & 51 - one slice; 52 & 53 - one slice; 54 & 55 - one slice; 56 - one slice (left posterior); 57 & 58 - one slice (deep margin undercut on both blocks); 59 & 60 - one slice; 61 & 62 - one slice; 63 & 64 - one slice; 65 to 68 - each one slice (block 68 - right posterior).  Please see the picture and the diagram.  All of the epidermal surface and 98% of the soft tissue is blocked.  (TO: HG:  EZ/mm 17.6.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Q Dimattia) 
The entire specimen has been examined.  Sections show extensive VIN 3.  Invasion appears imminent but not definite.  High grade VIN is clear of all margins (by at least 5mm).No urethra is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
Posterior vulva:  Extensive VIN 3.
