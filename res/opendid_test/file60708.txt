MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS + BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus with attached cervix, and bilateral tubes and ovaries. Specimen received bisected coronally through cervix and lower uterus. Specimen measures with uterus and cervix from superior to inferior is 75mm long, cervix anterior to posterior 30mm, cervix right to left 30mm, external os distorted by coronal disection, uterus anterior to posterior 40mm, and intercornual space is 45mm. Weight 101g. Anterior inked blue, posterior black, right red and left green. Myometrium is 12mm anteriorly and 15mm posteriorly. Endometrium is 4mm. Uterus cut into 10 slices. There is a vague creamy yellow polypoid-like thickening on posterior endometrium in slices 4-8 that extends posteriorly to 6mm from posterior serosa. It is 25mm in diameter maximally. A 6mm whorled lesion identified in the apex of uterus in slices 3-5. Right fallopian tube is 30x15mm with the fimbriae distorted by multiple cysts filled with thin golden yellow fluid. Serosa is fan and cut surface unremarkable. Right ovary is 22x10x10mm and has a creamy white serosa covered in a brown transparent fibrous covering. Cut surface of ovary is unremarkable. Left fallopian tube is 45x8mm with a creamy serosa and 3mm clear filled cyst on the middle third of the fallopian tube. Left ovary is 25x12x6mm. It has a creamy yellow serosa with unremarkable cut surface.
(1 right parametrium; 2 left parametrium; 3-7 composite of Slice 5; 8 from Slice 7; 9 from Slice 8; 10 right fallopian tube; 11 right fallopian tube cyst; 12 right ovary; 13 left fallopian tube; 14 left ovary). Representative sections (M-14)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of three pieces of yellow brown fatty tissue with an aggregate of 25x25x12mm. A 12mm diameter lymph node and three possible smaller lymph nodes identified.
(1 bisected larger lymph node; 2 three possible small lymph nodes). Representative sections (M-2)
C. &amp;quot;PERITONEAL BX&amp;quot;. Consists of a 12x4x1mm fragment of tan brown tissue. All embedded. (1-1)
D. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of three fragments of fatty tissue with an aggregate of 40x28x15mm. Multiple lymph nodes present. The largest with a 15mm diameter.
(1 bisected large lymph node; 2 multiple smaller lymph nodes within one strip of tissue; 3 two possible lymph nodes). All embedded. (M-3)
E. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BX&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of 15x15x6mm fibrofatty tissue. All embedded. (1-1/BM 16/6/2070 cy)

Immunostains for MMR proteins (Allstate MED/SURGERY WARD; block:  )

MLH1: abnormal (loss of staining)
PMS2: abnormal (loss of staining)
MSH2: normal (positive staining)
MSH6: normal (positive staining)

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.

Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
