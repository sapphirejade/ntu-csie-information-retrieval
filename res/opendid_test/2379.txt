Pelvic mass.  Ca 125 = 153.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis/portal hypertension.  Crohn's disease.  Antiphospholipid syndrome.  SLE.  Epilepsy.  Obstructive sleep apnoea.  Cholecystectomy, biliary stent.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube plus ovary" consists of an ovary with attached fallopian tube.  The ovary measures 240 x 170 x 80mm with an intact surface.  The fallopian tube measures 60 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary shows a multiloculated cyst filled with mucin.  No solid areas seen.  Two representative sections taken for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section tissue one; 2- fresh frozen section tissue two; 3 to 27 - RS of tumour; 28 & 29 - fimbrial end of fallopian tube; 30 & 31 - rest of the fallopian tube.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Mucinous tumour, benign in sections sampled.  
Phone result to Dr R Molden by Dr R Benesh/R Pagnozzi at 2.20pm on 05.05.65.
(TO: GN:  JF/mm 5.6.65)
B.Specimen labelled "Uterus, right tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right tube and right ovary weighing 89.6g.  The uterus measures 80 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth, shiny surface.  The ectocervix measures 25mm x 20mm.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 1mm in thickness and the myometrium measures up to 17mm.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 80mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25mm x 15mm x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 to 12 - fallopian tube (10 - fimbrial end); 13 - all of ovaries.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of terminal ileum 60mm in length in continuity with caecum and ascending colon measuring 140mm in length.  The proximal and distal open circumferences are 30 and 50mm respectively.  The proximal resection margin is inked blue and the distal resection margin is inked black.  There is an attached appendix measuring 70mm in length with an outer diameter of 20mm.  The mesocolon measures up to 50mm wide.  The serosal surfaces of the colon and the terminal ileum are unremarkable.  The mucosa and wall of the terminal ileum and colon are unremarkable.  The appendix has a bulging, expanded tip measuring 25mm x 30mm x 15mm.  The bulge area is inked blue.  The cut surface of the appendix shows a dilated tip with calcification and haemorrhagic areas.  A few lymph nodes are identified.
Blocks:  1 - proximal resection margin; 2 - distal resection margin; 3 - RS of terminal ileum; 4 to 7 - RS of colon; 8 - two LS of base; 9 -mid appendix; 10 to 15 - all of tip (10 - one slice; 11 &12 - one LS tip bisected; 13 & 14 - one LS tip bisected; 15 - one LS); 16 - one probable apical node; 18 to 20 - lymph nodes from mid section (18 - one lymph node; 19 - one lymph node bisected; 20 - one lymph node bisected); 21 - four lymph nodes; 22 - fat; 23 - fat.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left broad ligament and peritoneum" consists of tan brown fatty tissue measuring 50mm x 40mm x 15mm.  The cut surface shows a focal multiloculated cyst filled with mucin measuring 10mm x 10mm x 20mm.  The rest of the tissue is uniformly fatty.  AE blocks 1 to 8.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a fatty tissue measuring 280mm x 100 x 20mm.  There are multiple fociof mucin adherent to the fat, measuring from 15mm to 18mm in maximum dimension.  The rest of the tissue is uniform fat.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - representative sections of the mucinous area; 5 & 6 - RS of fat.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr R Zuehlsdorff): 
A.  Sections show ovary with a low grade mucinous neoplasm.  In the clinical context the features are most consistent with a metastasis from appendix.  Muchof the tumour consists of cystic spaces lined by bland columnar mucinous epithelium.  However in a minority of the tumour the epithelial cells are more crowded and have enlarged, atypical nuclei.  There is extensive escape of mucous intothe ovarian stroma.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable. 
B.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is weakly proliferative. The myometrium is unremarkable. Sectionsof the ovary show a few small surface epithelial inclusions.  The ovary is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tube show no significant abnormality. 
C.  The whole appendix has been blocked. The appendix is obliterated by fibrofat at the base.  More distally it is distended by mucous and shows involvement by a low grade mucinous neoplasm. The distended appendix is lined by mucinous columnar epithelium which is atypical.  Nuclei are crowded, enlarged and often multilayered.  Much of the wall is very attenuated and there is organising mucous on the serosal surface.  The mucous distending the wall is partly calcified and focally ossified.  No invasive adenocarcinoma of conventional type.  Sections of the terminal ileum and caecum are unremarkable.  A total of eleven lymph nodes were identified in the attached mesentery and these are all free of tumour. 
D.  Sections show fibrofat with a deposit of mucous.  The mucous is mostly lying free within stroma but some of it has associated low grade atypical columnar mucinous epithelium.  The featuresare of an implant of low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  Some organising mucous is seen on the serosal surface of the specimen. 
E.  Sections of the described mucinous areas show deposits of stromal mucous.  Some of the mucous has associated low grade atypical columnar mucinous epithelium but much of it is acellular.  (ec)
 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.   Left ovary and fallopian tube:  Metastatic low grade mucinous neoplasm.  
B.   Uterus, right ovary and right fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality. 
C.   Right hemicolectomy:  Low gradeappendiceal mucinous neoplasm.
D.   Left broad ligament and peritoneum:  Low grade mucinous neoplasm. 
E.   Omentum:  Low grade mucinous neoplasm.
