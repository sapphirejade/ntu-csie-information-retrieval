CLINICAL:
Ovarian cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of the ovary 25 x 10 x 7mm with attached fallopian tube 45mm long and up to 18mm in diameter and attached parametrial tissue 40 x 15 x 15mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  No focal lesions are identified.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - all of the ovary; 3 to 5 fallopian tube; 6 to 8 - parametrial tissue.  AE.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a solid tumour mass within the paradnexal soft tissues 35 x 25 x 25mm.  A small unremarkable ovary is adjacent and this measures 15 x 10mm.  The fallopian tube appears to be present within the soft tissue attached to the ovary however a fimbrial end is not identified.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - RS tumour (3 - reserved block); 5 to 11 - all of the attached soft tissue.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental fatty tissue 120 x 65 x 20mm.  There are five pale solid nodules ranging from 7 to 25mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - RS.  (TO: DD; DI/rt 23.3.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Baxter):
A, B & C.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma predominantly involving the left paradnexal soft tissue and omentum.  There are also tiny groups of serous carcinoma cells within the right paradnexal soft tissue.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin predominantly involving the left pardnexal soft tissue and omentum, and also involving the right paradnexal soft tissue.
