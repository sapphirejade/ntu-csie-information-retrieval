CLINICAL NOTES:
Palliative.  Small bowel NET.  Gallstones.  Small bowel, gallbladder.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL AND GALLBLADDER&amp;quot;.  Consists of gallbladder and a segment of small bowel.  The gallbladder measures 75mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm. The serosa is unremarkable.  The wall is up to 2mm thick. The mucosa is granular green in appearance.  Within the lumen are multiple stones ranging from 1-4mm.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus)

The segment of bowel measures 120mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm.  The serosa is kinked centrally.  On opening there is a tumour located at the kinked site.  This is 60mm from one margin and 45mm from opposite margin. Closest margin is inked blue, opposite margin black.  The tumour infiltrates into the underlying mesentery and appears to be clear of the serosa.

(3 margins; 4-7 TS through tumour [4&amp;amp;5 composite slices]; 8 LS of tumour in relation to normal bowel). RS (M-8/ MC 27/1/2068 ank)

Further blocks:
(9-13 further blocks).  RS (M-13/SM 2/1/2070 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr R Khalsa)
Sections of the gallbladder show features of very mild chronic cholecystitis. There is no thickening of the muscularis.

Sections of the small bowel tumour show a grade 1 (WHO) well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour. See synoptic report for details.
