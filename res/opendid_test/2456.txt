MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left fallopian tube" consists of a fallopian tube 70mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  There are several cysts 1 to 3mm in maximum dimension on the serosal surface.  Two blocks for frozen section.  RG/ESA/mm at 14.30, 12.06.65.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 to 5 - remainder of the specimen.  AE
(TO: HD:  BF/mm 17.6.65) 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign paratubal cyst.
Phone result to Ortelt (anaesthetic registrar) conveyed to Dr Rhys by Dr J Sarff/J Fredenburg/J Wend at 14.40hrs on 16.06.65
B.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, right tube, both ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, the right fallopian tube and both ovaries weighing 96g in total.  The uterus has been received partially opened.  The uterus measures 90 x 70 x 40mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The anterior soft tissue margin is inked blue and posterior margin is inked black.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Posteriorly over an area measuring 21 x 18mmin surface dimension the endometrium is thickened up to 4mm.  Definite extension into myometrium is not seen.  The right ovary measures 20 x 12 x 5mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm in length andup to 8mm in diameter.  There are numerous paratubal cysts ranging from 1 to 4mm in maximum dimension over the fallopian tube.  The left ovary measures 22 x 15 x 5mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - fullLS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 9 - representative posterior cervix; 10 & 11 - continuous LS of posterior body of uterus; 12 to 14 - full thickness section of body of uterus the entire thick endometrium is blocked; 16 - right fallopian tube and right ovary; 17 - left ovary.

C.  Specimen labelled "Left bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan and yellow solid tissue 25 x 15 x 3mm.  No nodules are identified.  Sliced and AE 1 block.
(TO: II:  MD/mm 17.6.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr J Buchbinder)
A.  The tube shows a mild hydrosalpinx and chronic salpingitis.  Several small paratubal cysts arepresent.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has probable early myometrial invasion of 3mm through a wall 19mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.  The tube shows a mild hydrosalpinx and a chronic salpingitis.  
C.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 3mm through a wall 19mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
