CLINICAL NOTES:
Appendiceal ca.
1. Meckel&amp;apos;s diverticulum.
2. Small bowel.
3. Small bowel, gallbladder, diaphragm, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;MECKEL&amp;apos;S DIVETICULUM&amp;quot;.  Consists of a segment of bowel forming a pouch with one edge stapled.  It measures 15x15x10mm.  There is attached fatty tissue 6mm maximum dimension. The surgical staples are trimmed off with approximately 3mm of tissue.  Margin is then inked red.  Specimen is trisected.  RS (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Consists of a short segment of small bowel with attached mesentery.  It measures 130mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm. The attached mesentery is up to 35mm wide. The serosa is roughened. On opening the mucosa looks is oedematous but is otherwise unremarkable.  One margin inked blue, the other black.  There are multiple sutures 15mm from the blue inked margin.  30mm from the black inked margin the wall is thickened ? tumour deposit.

(1 margins; 2&amp;amp;3 thickened roughened wall). RS (M-3)

C.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, DIAPHRAGM, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Consists of gallbladder, a short segment of small bowel, pieces of fibrotic tissue some with attached muscle consistent with diaphragm.  Multiple pieces of glistening tissue ? peritoneum and separate pieces of mucinous material.

Gallbladder measures 65mm in length with maximum diameter of 40mm.  The serosa is covered by mucinous tumour deposit. The wall is up to 25mm thick and involved by mucinous tumour deposit.  The mucosa is granular green and unremarkable.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body; 3 fundus)

Segment of small bowel measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm. The serosa is roughened and of an area measuring 50mm and has a full thickness disruption measuring 15x15mm.  One margin is inked blue, the other black. The mucosa is unremarkable. Within the wall is a mucinous tumour deposit.

(4 margins; 5 section of tumour including roughened serosa and site of full thickness disruption)

Pieces of tissue with attached muscle ? diaphragm in aggregate 160x120x15mm.  It is involved by mucinous tumour deposit.

(6&amp;amp;7 RS)

Multiple pieces of tissue involved with mucinous tumour (peritoneum) altogether measure 160x160x50mm.

(8&amp;amp;9 RS).  RS (M-9/MC 28/10/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Z Krahenbuhl)
A. Sections of the Meckel&amp;apos;s diverticulum show villiform small bowel mucosa throughout. There is no evidence of mucosal inflammation or ulceration. There is involvement of the serosal aspect by low-grade mucinous neoplasm, grade 1 (DPAM) characterised by pools of organising mucin containing strips and glands of low-grade mucinous epithelium.

B. Sections show involvement of the peritoneal surface the excised segment of the small bowel by low-grade mucinous neoplasm, grade 1 (DPAM). The deposits are characterised by low cellularity and low-grade cytology. The sampled small bowel mucosa is unremarkable.

C. Sections show serosal involvement of the gallbladder, the excised segment of small bowel, the fragments of peritoneum and presumed fragments of diaphragm by low-grade mucinous neoplasm (DPAM). The mucinous neoplasm is characterised by low cellularity and low nuclear grade. There is no signet ring cell change, high-grade cytology or desmoplastic invasion.

The gallbladder mucosa is moderately autolysed and unremarkable. Small bowel mucosa is unremarkable.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. MECKEL&amp;apos;S DIVERTICULUM
- SMALL BOWEL MUCOSAL LINED DIVERTICULUM .
- PERITONEAL INVOLVEMENT BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (DPAM).
B. SMALL BOWEL
- PERITONEAL INVOLVEMENT BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
C. GALLBLADDER, SMALL BOWEL, DIAPHRAGM AND PERITONEUM
- SEROSAL SURFACE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GALLBLADDER AND SMALL BOWEL BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (DPAM).
- INVOLVEMENT OF PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS AND DIAPHRAMATIC FRAGMENTS BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
