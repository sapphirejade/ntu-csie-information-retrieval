CLINICAL:
?metastatic benign leiomyoma - left anterolateral thigh lesion.  Multiple nodules throughout body.  Please also test for ER/PR reception status.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left thigh tumour", consists of pale grey nodule, 52 x 40 x 26mm, weighing 28g.  The external surface is smooth and covered by intact capsule.  The cut surfaces show solid pale grey tissue with a whorled appearance.  No areas of haemorrhage or necrosis are identified.  RS in 6 blocks.  (TO: QP;QO/vo 18.12.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Rayes):
Sections show a circumscribed and mostly encapsulated mass.  It is moderately cellular and consists of spindle shaped smooth muscle cell arranged in fascicles.  There is nonecrosis and no significant cytologic atypia.  Mitoses are infrequent.  The appearances are of a smooth muscle tumour which histologically appears benign.  Excision appears complete.  
Immunostains:
Smooth muscle actin:   Positive.
Desmin:   Positive.
S100:   Negative.
Ki-67:   Low proliferation index, around 3-4%.
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.
                                   90% of tumour cells show positive staining.
                                   Predominant intensity of staining:  Strong. 
Progesterone receptor:   Positive.
                                    75% of tumour cells show positive staining.
                                    Predominant intensity of staining:  Strong.  
 
DIAGNOSIS:
Left anterolateral thigh:  Histologically benign smooth muscle tumour (leiomyoma).
