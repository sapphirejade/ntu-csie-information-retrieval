HISTORY:  
Benign cystic meso.  Redo peritonectomy.  Gallbladder, peritoneum.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE".  An intact gallbladder 70mm in length and up to 30mm in diameter. The external surface is green and smooth. The gallbladder wall measures up to 5mm thick. The gallbladder was filled with bile.  No stones were identified. The mucosal surface is green and velvety.  No lesions are identified. There is an unorientated ellipse of skin with underlying fatty tissue.  The skin measures 320x15mm to a depth of12mm.  The skin surface is unremarkable.  Also within the specimen jar multiple pieces of omentum/fatty tissue with multiple cysts adherent to the fatty tissue. The cysts have a translucent lining filled with straw coloured fluid.  No excrescences are identified.  No solid lesions are seen. The cysts range in size from 2 up to 8mm in maximum dimension.
(1&2 gallbladder [1 TS from cystic duct and body, 2 LS through the fundus]; 3-5 sections through the skin [3LS from the poles and 4&5 TS through the middle]; 6-14 RS through the cystic lesion; 15 section through the omentum).  RS (M-15/CF/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr I. Bertucci)
Histology confirms the presence of multiple peritoneal mesothelial inclusion cysts characterised by an inner lining of hobnailed epithelium with mild cytological atypia with supporting fibrous stroma.  Immunostains show positivity for WT1 and CK5/6. CEA is negative.  The inclusion cysts are seen predominantly within peritoneal/omental tissue with a single focus seen on the serosa of the gallbladder. The skin contains dermal scarring and fibrosis but is not involved by the process.  The gallbladder also shows mild chronic cholecystitis witrh cholesterolosis of the mucosa.
DIAGNOSIS:  
GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE - MULTILOCULAR PERITONEALMESOTHELIAL INCLUSION CYSTS.
