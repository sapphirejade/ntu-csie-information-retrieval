DR YARRANJI YARA-MAY Bovio
Distribution:     FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY

CLINICAL:
R breast Ca at 5 o'clock.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast sentinel node 1 (3139)" consists of one lymph node and surrounding fatty tissue 23 x 13 x 5mm.  The lymph node measures 12 x 7 x 4mm.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue stitches short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches measuring 22 (lateral to medial) x 45 (superior to inferior) x 38mm (superficial to deep).  On the superficial aspect there is a piece of skin 15 x 6mm.  The margins are inked in three colours:lateral green, medial red and deep black.  Specimen is serially sliced into eight sections from superior to inferior.  In slice four there is a pale solid tumour 7 x 6 x 8mm.  The tumour is 8mm from lateral, 6mm from medial, 4mm from deep, 16mm from superficial, 15mm from superior and 20mm from inferior margin.
Blocks:  1 - slice one en face (superior); 2 - slice two; 3 & 4 - slice three; 5 & 6 - slice four (6 - ER, PR, HER-2, Ki-67); 7 & 8 - slice five; 9 - slice six; 10 - slice seven; 11 & 12 - slice eight (inferior margin).  AE.  Please see the diagram.
