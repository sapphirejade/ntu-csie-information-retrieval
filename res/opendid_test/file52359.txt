MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral
Number of slices: 14
FINDINGS / LESION:  At the site of hookwire split is a pale, white lesion seen in Slices 7 and 8. It measures 10mm superior to inferior, 5mm anterior to posterior, 8mm medial to lateral. The lesion is 17mm from superior margin, 25mm from inferior margin, 7mm from anterior margin, 16mm from posterior margin, 24mm from medial margin and 28mm from lateral margin. Remainder of the breast tissue is predominantly fatty. Representative sections taken.
(1 longitudinal through medial margin, Slice 1; 2 and 3 Slice 3; 4-6 Slice 6; 7-9 Slice 7; 10 and 11 superior half, Slice 8; 12-14 Slice 10; 15-17 Slice 12; 8-21 longitudinal through lateral margin, Slice 14]). RS (M-21/MC 29/7/2068 cy)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. N. Kasprowicz)
A.  The paraffin sections of the two sentinel nodes have been sectioned at multiple levels and with pancytokeratin stains. There is no evidence of malignancy (0/2).

B.  The majority of the specimen has been embedded and shows fibrofatty tissue.  Two separate foci of invasive lobular carcinoma are identified which are approximately 10mm apart.

Tumour 1 is present in slices 6, 7 and 8 inclusive (spanning a total of 3 slices) to give a maximum dimension of 15mm.  Tumour 1 is grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma (tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses ?1/3).

Tumour 2 is present in slice 11.  Tumour 2 is a 5mm grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma (tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/2)

Both foci of invasive lobular carcinoma are well clear of margins.

The remaining breast tissue in proximity with both tumours shows extensive lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia.  There are also changes suggestive of previous biopsy adjacent to tumour 1 including foamy macrophages, fibrosis and haemorrhage.  The breast tissue otherwise shows benign proliferative changes including a radial scar, columnar cell change without atypia, fibrocystic change and usual duct hyperplasia. There is also patchy chronic inflammation around ducts.
