Stage 1 A2 cervical cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Cervix uterus bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 102g in total.  The uterus measures 78 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 30 x 26mm and is discoloured by blue surgical dye.  The cervical os appears stenotic.  On opening the endometrium measures less than 1mm thick on a myometrium that measures up to 23mm thick.  Within the cavity there is an endometrial polyp with base located 45mm from the cervical resection margin and measuring 24 x 14 x 4mm.  There is no evidence of macroscopic invasion at the base of polyp.  No myometrial lesions are identified.  The right fallopian tube measures 30 x 7mm and the right ovary measures 30 x 18 x 15mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 40 x 7mm and the left ovary measures 32 x 20 x 15mm.  The serosa of both adnexa is smooth and shiny and a single unilocular cyst is identified within the left ovary measuring 12mm in diameter.  No other lesions are identified.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal sections through anterior body and cervix including base of endometrial polyp; 4 to 10 - remainder of anterior cervix.  All embedded from one end to the other; 11 &amp;amp; 12 - remainder of endometrial polyp base; 13 to 15 - full longitudinal section through posterior body and cervix; 16 to 22 - remainder of posterior cervix embedded from one end to the other; 23 &amp;amp; 24 - right adnexa; 25&amp;amp; 26 - left adnexa.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right pelvic lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of multiple pieces of fatty tissue measuring 43 x 35 x 24mm in aggregate.  8 possible lymph nodes are identified within the fat measuring 8 to 20mm in maximal dimension.  All nodes embedded.  Blocks: 1 - three nodes; 2 - two nodes; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - one lymph node per block bisected; 5 &amp;amp; 6 - one lymph node serially sliced.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left pelvic lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of multiple pieces of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 40 x 15mm in aggregate.  7 possible lymph nodes are identified within the fat ranging in size from 6 to 25mm in maximal dimension.  All nodes embedded.  Blocks: 1 - three nodes; 2 to 4 - one lymph node per block bisected; 5 &amp;amp; 6 - one lymph node serially sliced.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Louge):
The previous report 86F91576 is noted.
A.  The entire cervix has been examined.  There is no residual CIN or invasive carcinoma.  There is no AIS.
The endometrium is weakly proliferative and contains a benign polyp.  The myometrium shows adenomyosis.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
No residual CIN or invasive carcinoma.  Fifteen (15) negative lymph nodes.
