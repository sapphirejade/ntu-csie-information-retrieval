CLINICAL:
Recurrent vulval cancer.  Lichen sclerosis.  Hypertension.  Recurrent vulval squamous cell carcinoma.  Wide excision.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left groin nodule" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 50 x 45 x 25mm.  There is a firm but ill defined nodule 25mm across.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - RS in nodule for frozen section; 3 & 4 - further sections of nodule.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Squamous cell carcinoma
Result to Dr Ewan by Dr P Crichlow at 10:22am on 07.08.2065
B.  Specimen labelled "Left groin" consists of an ovoid piece of skin 145 x 70mm with underlying subcutaneous tissue to a depth of 50mm.  There is a central area of epidermal induration.  Underlying this area within the subcutis there is a tumour nodule with cystic degeneration, 35 x 20 x 15mm.  At the deep margin is a soft ill defined pale grey area 15mm across.  A 7mm lymph node is identified.  A 6mm tan papule is present at the edge of the skin.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - maintumour nodule; 6 & 7 - separate fibrous area; 8 - one lymph node; 9 - skin papule.
C.  Specimen labelled "Femoral canal" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 20mm across.  An 8mm lymph node is identified.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left medial groin fat" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 35 x 20 x 15mm.  No lymph nodes are identified.  AE 3 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral groin fat" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 50 x 30 x 30mm.  No lymphnodes are identified.  AE 5 blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled "Lower abdominal scar" consists of a triangleof skin 18 x 11 x 18mm.  There is a 12mm scar.  TAE 1 block.  (TO: FO; NR/rt 7.9.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Korbal):
A.  Sections show a deposit of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma withinadipose tissue.  No lymph node is identified.  Focal perineural invasion is present.
B.  Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma within the subcutis.  There are also three adjacent small lymph nodes which are negative. 
The tumour appears clear of the margins.  Vascular invasion is present within the subcutis. A benign compound nevus is also noted.
C. One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
D.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F.There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma within the left groin subcutis.Perineural and vascular invasion is present.  Five lymph nodes are negative.
