CLINICAL:
CRC.  CLM in seg IVb.  Left liver.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Gallbladder and left lobe of liver", consists of a partial liver resection 160 x 110 x 90mm and a separate gallbladder 100mm in length and a 100mm in circumference.  The capsular surface of the gallbladder is smooth and glistening.  The wall of the gallbladder is up to 2mm thick.  The mucosal surface is green and granular.  Nogallstones are seen.  The capsular surface of the liver is smooth.  The resection margin is inked blue.  Slicing the liver reveals an extensively necrotic pale solid tumour 74 x 55 x 45mm.  The nodule is less than 1mm from the capsular surface of the liver.  The nodule is very close to the resection margin.  
Blocks: 1 - cystic duct margin andTS neck; 2 - TS body; 3 - LS fundus; 4 - tumour and liver capsule; 5 and 6 - tumour and resection margin; 7 - tumour and liver capsule; 8 - centre of tumour, reserved block; 9 - liver awayfrom tumour. 
(TO: DN;VQ/vo 10.5.65). 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof O Bundschuh and Dr O Sigler):
Sections of gallbladder show focal pseudopyloric metaplasia and moderate chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy in the gallbladder. 
Sections of liver show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive tumour necrosis. Large peripheral areas of the tumour appear histologically viable.
The appearances are similar to those of the colonic primary (lab no 55X90069) and are consistent with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The tumour is 1.2mm from the resection margin. The liver away from the tumour show mildsteatosis and very mild non-specific active portal inflammation. 


DIAGNOSIS:
Gallbladder and left lobe of liver:
- Metastatic colorectal carcinoma in liver with extensive necrosis.
- No significant abnormalities in gallbladder
