CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritonectomy for appendix tumour ?low grade, appendix tumour, right colon, gallbladder, omentum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, APPENDIX, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;.  Multiple components in the same jar.

There is a right hemicolectomy including portion of terminal ileum measuring 250mm in length, 20mm in diameter with portion of colon including caecum 50mm in length, 30mm in diameter.  Attached enlarged, dilated,distorted and distended appendix, 120x50x40mm.  Outer surface appears haemorrhagic with patchy grey foci.  At the tip, there is an area of defect 10mm in diameter.  Defect edges inked blue.  Appendiceal orifice probed and appendix open longitudinally.  It appears dilated and filled with mucin.  Appendiceal wall  is thin, measuring 1 to 2mm with grey smooth lining.
Small amount of mesocolon attached to the caecum, separated and searched for lymph nodes.  Some irregularity present over the small bowel and cecum serosa,  sampled. bowel mucosa appears unremarkable.

There is a gallbladder measuring 70x30x20mm.  Serosa appears irregular with multiple black foci.  Wall thickness measures 3mm and mucosa appears velvety.  No lesion identified in the mucosa.

Multiple fibrofatty tissue including omentum and diaphragm,  measuring 220x150x60mm in aggregate, mixed with mucin.  However, no obvious solid lesion containing mucin present macroscopically.  Representative section embedded.

(1  proximal and distal surgical margin of the hemi; 2-7  full face longitudinal appendix [5  ?preparation and 2 orifice]; 8&amp;amp;9  area of ?perforation; 10-12  transverse section of the appendix; 13  one lymph node bisected around the appendix; 14  ?four lymph nodes; 15  small bowel; 16  caecum; 17  gallbladder; 18-24  sections of soft tissue ?mucinous changes; 25  tissue banking).  RS (M-25/SM 11/9/2070 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. B Bores)
Sections of appendix show low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN). The tumour is lined by low-grade mucin secreting epithelium with papilliform area and subjacent stromal fibrosis. On the serosal surface, focal accumulation of acellular mucin associated with granulation-type tissue is identified. One area shows destruction of the muscle wall, suggestive of perforation. Focal reactive mesothelial proliferation is noted. No evidence of malignancy is seen in 5 lymph nodes identified.
The mucosal surface of the proximal and distal resection margins appear unremarkable.
Acellular mucin is present on the serosal surface of the small bowel and caecum. There is associated reactive mesothelial proliferation.
Sections of the gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis. Sections of the peritoneal tissue show mucin locules associated with granulation tissue and patchy lymphocytic infiltrate. There is deposition of acellular mucin on the surface of the diaphragm.
DIAGNOSIS:
GALLBLADDER, APPENDIX, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE AND DIAPHRAGM
- LOW-GRADE APPENDICEAL MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (LAMN).
- ACELLULAR MUCIN INVOLVING APPENDICEAL SEROSA, PERITONEUM, SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL SEROSA AND DIAPHRAGM.
