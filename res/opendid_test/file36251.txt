CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritonectomy - anterior resection, omentum, right hemi, gallbladder, spleen, B/o diaphragm, peritoneum. App. Adenoca.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SPLEEN, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, DIAPHRAGM, STOMACH, ANTERIOR RESECTION&amp;quot;.  Multiple tissue and organs in the same jar including:

Right hemicolectomy including a portion of terminal ileum 80mm in length 35mm circumference.  Portion of colon 130mm in length and 90mm circumference.  There is a tumour attached to the serosa at the junction of ileocaecal valve, obliterated appendix measuring 60x40x30mm.  Sectioning shows the firm white lesion occupying the appendix and invading the colonic wall.  Multiple tumour deposits and involved lymph nodes are identified in the peritoneum.

Rectosigmoid measuring 300mm in length and 30mm circumference.  Serosa and pericolic fat appears involved by multiple tumour deposits. Mucosa appears unremarkable.

There is a spleen measuring 10x10x70mm.  There is attached fatty tissue with multiple tumour deposits and nodularity 150x80x80mm.  Sectioning shows that there is a tumour deposit at the hilar plane possible going to parenchyma.

There is a gallbladder measuring 80x30x30mm.  Multiple adhesions over the serosa and fatty tissue surrounding the cystic duct.  The gallbladder mucosa appears velvety.
Portion of stomach 130x60x50mm.  Mucosa appears unremarkable. Multiple adhesions over the serosa noted.
Omental cake with multiple nodularities and thickened foci 300x200mm with a thickness of 30-60mm.
Multiple diaphragmatic strips with foci of tumour deposit also present.

(1-3 one full face of appendix with the colon and tumour; 4-6 second full face appendix and colon; 7&amp;amp;8 pericolic fat; 9 distal margin of rectum; 10 rectum and tumour deposit; 11&amp;amp;12 colon and tumour deposit and pericolic fat; 13-15 tumour and spleen; 16 fatty tissue around the spleen; 17&amp;amp;18 gallbladder [17 cystic duct, 18 gallbladder]; 19&amp;amp;20 stomach; 21&amp;amp;22 omental cake).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. B Awe)
Sections of appendix show an infiltrating poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. The tumour cells are embedded within large mucin pools. There is extensive lymphatic permeation. Carcinoma involves the periappendiceal fat and extends into free serosal surface which shows reactive mesothelial proliferation. Multiple deposits of tumour are also noted within the adjacent colonic fatty mesentery. Perineural and intraneural involvement is present. Metastatic carcinoma is present on the serosa of the rectum.
There is extensive deposition of tumour cells and mucin on the capsular surface of the spleen extending into the perisplenic fat and peritoneum.
There is tumour involving the fat surrounding the gallbladder. The cystic duct lymph node shows lipogranuloma. The serosal surface of the gallbladder also shows deposition of mucinous carcinoma.
Sections of the stomach show metastatic carcinoma involving serosal surface. Sections of the omentum also show extensive involvement by mucinous adenocarcinoma.
3 lymph nodes are identified in the hemicolectomy specimen and all three show metastatic carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry stains show positive staining for cytokeratin 20, CDX2
Negative:  synaptophysin, chromogranin, cytokeratin 7
Immunostains for MSI proteins (Southern BYRON CENTRAL HOSPITAL; block: 1 )
MLH1: 		positive
PMS2: 	positive
MSH2: 	positive
MSH6: 	positive
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
DIAGNOSIS:
SPLEEN, OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, DIAPHRAGM, STOMACH, ANTERIOR RESECTION
- MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS INVOLVING APPENDIX, OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER AND STOMACH.
