MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "BOWEL, UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT OVARY + TUBE".  A uteruswith attached cervix, left tube and ovary.  It weighs in total 35g.  The uterus measures up to 40mm from medial to lateral, 55mm from fundus to cervix an 20mm from anterior to posterior. The attached cervix measures 25mm in maximal diameter, is unremarkable macroscopically.  The attached left fallopian tube measures up to 40mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The fimbrial end is not readily visualised. The left ovary measures up to 20x10x6mm.  On sectioning the cervicalos appears occluded and there is mucus in the lumen.  The endometrium measures less than 1mm and the myometrium measures up to 10mm in maximal extent.  On sectioning the ovary shows a thin walled cyst 10mm in maximal extent and is otherwise unremarkable.
(1-3 cervix to fundus full face uterus; 4 LS fimbrial end and adjacent cyst; 5 representative TS tube; 6&7 ovary all embedded)
Separate in the specimen container is a portion of bowel measuring upto 100mm in length and 30mm in diameter.  The external surface shows some petechial haemorrhage and some irregular areas ? adhesions.  The bowel segment blind ended with a well healed resection margin (inked green). The opposing resection margin is inked blue.  On sectioning there is a mesenteric node which appears necrotic.  
(8&9 LS resection margin; 10&11 firm areas ? adhesions; 12 ? necrotic bisected node; 13 four possible nodes; 14 two possible nodes; 15&16 representative mesenteric fat with possible node).  RS (M-16)
B.  "STOMA".  A stoma with surrounding fat and circumferential skin.  The bowel lumen measures 20mm in diameter with underlying connective tissue for a length of25mm.  The deep aspect is oversewn with sutures.  Possible skin margin inked blue.  On opening the mucosa is unremarkable.  
(1 LS stoma; 2 representative mesenteric fat with possible node).  RS (M-2)
C.  "GASTRO-COLIC LIGAMENT". An orientated piece of fatty tissue with serosal surface over some areas.  It measures up to 150x120x10mm in maximal extent. There is some petechial haemorrhage and rough areas ? adhesions.  On sectioning there are somesuspicious firm areas but no definite mass is identified.  
(1-4 RS).  RS (M-4)
D.  "DISTAL BOWEL". A segment of bowel with lumen measuring 20mm in diameter and 20mm in length.  The opposing is blind ended with staples.  Margin inked blue.  End with staples inked red.  On opening the mucosa appears oedematous.  
(1 representative LS full face lumen to staple margin; 2 representative mesenteric fat).  RS (M-2)
E.  "POUCH OFDOUGLAS".  Two pieces of unorientated irregular grey to brown haemorrhagic tissue measuring in aggregate 15x15x10mm.  
(1 piece one all embedded; 2 piece two longitudinally bisected).  AE (M-2)
F.  "DISTAL DONUT".Two separate donuts, one with staple line measuring 20mm in diameter and 5mm in length.  Margin inked blue (staples removed).  The second donut measures 15mm in diameter and 10mm in length with sutures (margin inked black).
(1 donut one bisected; 2 donut two bisected).  AE (M-2)
G.  "APPENDIX". An appendix measuring 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter. There is mesoappendix attached along the length. The external appearance shows some focal haemorrhagic areas.  No tumour deposits identified.  On sectioning the lumen appears patent.
(1 two LS distal; 2 four TS mid; 3 two LS proximal; 4 trimmed mesoappendix).  AE (M-4/FA/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. B. Seebold)
A.  Sections of the fallopian tube show a small deposit of high grade serous carcinoma in the paratubal stromal tissue.  The tubal mucosa is unremarkable. The macroscopically described paratubal cyst is a benign simple cyst.  Sections of the ovary show several small collections of psammoma bodies with admixed haemosiderin laden macrophages without evidence of residual viable tumour.  The ovarian parenchyma is otherwise within normal limits
Sections of the cervix show relatively atrophic ectocervix and unremarkable  endocervix with occasional Nabothian cysts.  The endometrium is atrophic and the myometrium is unremarkable.
The mucosa of the excised bowel segment is unremarkable. The serosal surface shows patchy immature fibrosis and fat necrosis including multinucleated giant cells.   The macroscopically described possible necrotic lymph node is an area of fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of lymph node architecture and no evidence of malignancy within this necrotic focus.  Three paracoliclymph nodes are identified, and one of these shows a small focus of high grade serous carcinoma.
B.  Sections of the stomal opening show focally ulcerated colonic mucosa with areas of polypoid granulation tissue and fat necrosis with immature scar tissue.  Two benign reactive lymph nodes are identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show fragments of fibroadipose tissue including scattered foci of granulomatous inflammation.  The granulomas are discrete and bland. There is no necrosis or suppurative inflammation and no foreign material is identified on polarising microscopy.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections of the bowel segment show smallclusters of highly atypical cells in  subserosal connective tissue, some within lymphovascular spaces, with appearances consistent with high grade serous carcinoma.
E.  Sections show strips of peritoneum with scattered chronic inflammatory infiltrates.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections of the donut tissue show unremarkable fragments of bowel wall.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Sections of the appendix show fibrosis of the lumen. There is no evidence of inflammation or malignancy.
