CLINICAL:
Risk reducing surgery.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with cervix andbilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 150g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 90 x 80 x 50mm.  The ectocervix is 37 x 35mm.  The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometrium is 24mm thick.  There are several intramural fibroids ranging from 5 to 25mm across.  The left ovary is 45 x 20 x 12mm.  The left fallopian tube is 55mm in length.  The right ovary is 34 x 20 x 10mm, and the left fallopian tube is 55mm in length.  Over the left ovary is a solid pale grey nodule 20mm across.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 and 8 - fibroids; 9 to 12 - left fallopian tube serially embedded; 13 to15 - left ovary; 16 to 18 - nodule adjacent to left ovary; 20 to 21 - right fallopian tube; 22 to 25 - right ovary.  Ovaries and fallopian tubes AE.  (TO: LR;YP/vo 21.4.65)  Re-select - 26 to 30 - further sections of fibroids.  JF 25.4.65.
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Brucculeri):
Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  One of the leiomyomas shows cystic degeneration, hyalinization, focal necrosis and some increased cellularity and mild atypia.  Mitoses number up to 2/10 high power fields.  The appearances are interpreted as degenerative.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
The ovaries and fallopian tubes have been blocked in their entirety, in accordance with the protocol for risk reducing surgery.  Sections of the fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.  The described nodule adjacent to the left ovary is a sclerotic fibroma; there is no evidence of malignancy.  A few small simple cysts are also present in the left ovary.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr Y Peyton.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:
1.  Uterine leiomyomas.
2.  Fibroma left ovary.
