CLINICAL:
Right ovarian mass.  Ca 125 = 41.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Endometrial curetting" consists of tan fragments and mucoid material 30 x 22 x 4mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + right ovary" consists of a morcellated ovary 100 x 95 x 30mm in aggregate.  There is a tubular fragment (?fallopian tube) 28mm in length and up to 7mm indiameter.  The fragments of the ovary show solid pale to yellow and mucoid areas.
Blocks:  1 - the entire ?fallopian tube fragment; 2 to 11 - RS (11 - reserved block).
(TO: EB; DC/rt 27.8.65); 12 to 22 - more sections.  (TO: TP:  FP/mm 9.1.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Saltzberg:
A.  Sections show proliferative endometrium.  Fragments of both endocervical and endometrial polyp are also present.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.  
B. The fragmented ovary is well sampled.  Sections show small foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising in association with a mixed serous and endometrioid borderline tumour.  The carcinoma is composed of several foci in which there are crowded endometrioid glands lined by stratified nuclei with grade 1 to 2 nuclear features within fibrous stroma, which in some areas appears altered and desmoplastic.  No solid architecture is seen.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  With immunostains the tumour shows WT1 expression and is p53 negative.  Although this immunoprofile is more typically seen in serous ovarian tumours there appears to be a significant admixture of serous and endometrioid borderline components and the carcinomatous component (Blocks B7, B20 and B22) appears endometrioid in type.
Seen in consultation with Dr N Dibari.
B.  The fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and shows no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Endometrial curettings:
-  Proliferative endometrium with fragments of endocervical and endometrial polyps.
B.  Right fallopian tube and right ovary:
-  Small foci of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising in association with a mixedserous and endometrioid borderline tumour.
