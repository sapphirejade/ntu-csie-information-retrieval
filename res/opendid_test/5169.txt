HISTORY:  
Peritoneal mesothelioma.  Pelvic mass, anterior resection, diaphragm nodule, bilateral diaphragm peritoneum, appendix, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, umbilicus, lymph nodes.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "LYMPH NODES ROOT OF MESENTERY".  One fatty piece of tissue measuring 100mm in maximum extent.  The specimen is bisected and all embedded in one block.  AE (3-1).
B.  "OMENTUM, SPLEEN, APPENDIX, GALLBLADDER, UMBILICUS, DIAPHRAGM, PERITONEUM, ANTERIOR RESECTION, LARGE CYSTIC MASS".  
Anterior resection, large cystic mass, appendix, gallbladder, spleen, omentum and a few pieces of tissue representing peritoneum.  The anterior resection specimen measures 130mm in length with the circumference of the bowel up to 50mm.  The bowel appears oedematous.  There is a pale white nodular mass identified on the serosal surface of the bowel measuring 100x70mm.  One surgical margin of the bowel is opened and the other margin is stapled.  The opened margin is margin one, the stapled margin is margin two.  The tumour is located close to margin one at about 12mm from margin one.  Thickness of the tumour is up to 35mm.  
(1 LS of margin one; 2 LS margin two; 3-6 RS tumour with bowel;
There is a multicystic mass measuring 180x110x80mm.  It weighs 436g.  On sectioning, the mass appears multicystic, filled with brown fluid. The surface of the mass appears fibrotic on sectioning, there are multiple cystic lesions up to 20mm in maximal extent.  
-10 RS of multicystic mass;
There is an appendix measuring 45mm in length with diameter up to 5mm.  The serosa is smooth and shiny.
11-distal appendix; 12-body, 13-proximal appendix.  
There is a gallbladder measuring 80x25x25mm.  The serosa is smooth and shiny and the gallbladder is filled with viscous bile.  No gallstones identified.  The mucosa is velvety. 
14 proximal surgical margin; 15 RS gallbladder; 16 LS fundus;
The spleen measures 100x80x50mm.  The spleen weighs 162g.  There are adhesions of the omentum to the spleen.  On sectioning, there are foci of tumour seen within the hilum of the spleen.  
17&18 RS hilar depositionsof the spleen; 19 unaffected spleen;
A piece of omentum measuring 410x70x35mm.  There are multiple depositions of tumour identified within the omentum.  The depositions appear pale white, some partially myxoid measuring up to25mm in maximum extent.  
20-24 - omentum  RS  
There are multiple pieces of peritoneum in the container measuring an aggregate of 160x160x80mm.  There are multiple small nodules of pale white deposition on the peritoneum identified.  
25&26 RS of peritoneum.  RS (M-26/IV/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (B. Kirsten)
A.  The section shows lymph node with reactive changes only. 
B.  Sections of the segment of segment of large bowel show normal appearing mucosa and muscularis propria. There is a tumour infiltrating within the pericolic adipose tissue consisting of a biphasic population of pleomorphic spindle cells and withtubular-glandular and papillary areas with moderate cytologic atypia. Desmoplastic stromal reaction is seen and collagenous fibrous nodules are admixed with the tumour. Serosal tumour is 6mm from the closest colonic surgical resection margin. 
Sections of the separate multicystic haemorrhagic mass demonstrate a central zone of haemorrhage and fibrin with the surrounding fibrous capsular zone with cellular pleomorphic spindle cells with mitotic activity consistent with spindling mesothelioma. There is also some adjacent non-tumour fibrous tissue and adipose tissue. 
Sections of the appendix show normal appearingmucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria. There are serosal adhesions and there are also deposits of biphasic tumour on the serosal/mesoappendiceal adipose tissue. 
Sections of the gallbladder show serosal adhesions.  
Sections of the splenic parenchyma are unremarkable. In the hilar adipose tissue there are deposits of biphasic tumour. 
Sections of the omentum and peritoneum show tumour deposits consisting of biphasic tumour as described previously. 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (Block B20): There is positive staining for CAM5.2, CK5/6, WT-1, and calretinin. 
COMMENT:
The appearances are those of biphasic malignant mesothelioma. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONECTOMY - BIPHASIC MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA
