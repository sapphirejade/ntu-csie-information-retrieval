MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr N Counselman):
A.  Sections show mesothelium with underlyingfibrofat.  There is a foreign body giant cell reaction present.  No tumour is seen.
B.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
C.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections of the endometrium show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  It is architectural grade 2 but cytologic grade 3 so is overall grade 3.  It forms a polypoid massin the endometrial vavity but also shows superficial myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 4mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 46mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified in the myometrium.  There is also  extensive tumour involvement of adenomyosis throughout themyometrium.  Tumour directly extends into the cervix where there is extensive cervical stromal invasion.  
Sections of the cervical tumour show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, identical to the endometrial tumour.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the cervix.  There is also focal perineural invasion in the outer ectocervix (block E 76).  Maximum depth of cervical involvement is 22mm out of a total cervical thickness of 28mm.  The tumour is 3mm from the outer radial cervical margin at the closest point and is 5mm from the vaginal cuff margin at the closest point.
Residual cervical squamous and glandular mucosa is unremarkable; no CIN or adenocarcinoma in situ is seen.  One small unremarkable lymph node is identified in paracervical fat.
The endometrial tumour is continuous with the cervical tumour.  The tumour isconsidered to be an endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrial origin.  
A foreign body giant cell reaction is identified on the serosa of the uterus focally.
Sections of the ovaries show the presence of cystic follicles.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  There is a focal foreignbody giant cell reaction on the serosa of the right fallopian tube.  The fallopian tubes are otherwise unremarkable.
Immunostains:
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
F.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
G.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
H.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
I.  Sections show three lymph nodes:  No tumour is seen.
J.  Sections of appendix show a focal foreign body giant cell reaction on the serosal surface.  The appendix is otherwise unremarkable.
K.  Sections show fat with some patchy surface reactive mesothelial proliferation and surface foreign body giant cell reaction.  No tumour is seen.

A.  Peritoneal biopsy:  Foreign body reaction, no tumour.
B.  Left external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
C.  Right external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
D.  Right parametrial lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
E.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium with extensive, deep cervical stromal invasion.  Stage 2.

F.  Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/6).
G.  Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
H.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
I.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
J.  Appendix:  Focal foreign body reaction on serosal surface.
