CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer grade 1.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 182g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 70 x 70mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The non-peritonealised surfaces are inked green anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 45 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  In mid to upper endometrial cavity anteriorly and posteriorly there is an ill defined pale friable solid tumour, 52 x 32 x 15mm.  Definite myometrial infiltration is not seen.  The myometrium is 33mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids 8 and 5mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mmin length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 15mm and contains a unilocular single cyst, 15mm in maximum dimension.  The cyst is filled with clear fluid and has a smooth inner surface.  The left fallopian tube is 55mm long and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 35 x 30 x 15mm.  Within the left ovary there is a unilocular cyst, 18 x 15 x 12mm.  The cyst is surrounded by an undulating yellow/orange circumferential solid area.  Within the left ovary there is a second unilocular cyst, 10mm in maximum dimension filled with clear fluid and with a smooth lining (block 23).  
Blocks:  1 to 5 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 6 to 12 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix (9&10- paired; 11&12- paired); 13 & 14 - paired sections body of uterus (13 -reserved block); 15 & 16 - paired sections body of uterus; 17 & 18 - paired sections body of uterus; 19 - sectionof myometrium, fibroid; 20 - RS right ovary; 21 - RS right fallopian tube; 22 & 23 - RS left ovary; 24 - representative left fallopian tube approximately 80% of the tumour is blocked.

:  (Reported by Dr C Sawney) 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  There is also a background of atypical complex hyperplasia with squamous morule formation.  The tumour appears confined to the endometrium.No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  
The left ovary shows a corpus luteal cyst and a follicular cyst.  The right ovary shows a follicular cyst.  Both tubes are unremarkable.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
