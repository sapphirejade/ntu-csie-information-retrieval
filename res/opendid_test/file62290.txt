CLINICAL NOTES:
Endometrial ca.

1.   Peritoneal washings.
2.   Uterus, tubes and ovaries.
3.   R pelvic sentinel node.
4.   L pelvic sentinel node.
5.   Omentum biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;.   Consists of uterus with attached cervix, bilateral and ovaries.   Specimen is received partially bivalved in the coronal plane.   Anterior is inked blue, posterior black.   The uterus with attached cervix weighs 69g and measures 75 superior to inferior, 30 intercornual distance.   Ectocervix is 30x20 with a slit-like os 15mm.   It is cream-coloured unremarkable.   Anterior endomyometrium is 14mm.   Posterior endomyometrium is 17mm.   The endometrium is less than 1mm thick.   There is an intrauterine device in-situ.   The lower uterine segment shows nabothian cyst.   No discrete lesion is identified.

(1  right parametrial tissue; 2   left parametrial tissue; 3  right cornu; 4  left cornu; 5  anterior and posterior cervix; 6   anterior and posterior lower uterine segment; 7&amp;amp;8  anterior endomyometrium; 9&amp;amp;10  posterior endomyometrium [5-10  one full face sagittal slice]; 11&amp;amp;12  further sections of anterior endomyometrium ; 13&amp;amp;14  further sections of posterior endomyometrium; 15-17  remainder of the endometrium [entire endometrium embedded]).

The right ovary and fallopian tube together weigh 12g and fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm.   Serosa is dusky and there are three paratubal cysts, 2 to 9mm, filled with clear serous fluid.   Ovary is 25x15x6mm.   Serosa is unremarkable.   On sectioning through the ovary, it is partially cystic.   The cyst is up to 17mm.   The inner lining of the cyst is smooth.

(18  right fallopian tube; 19  right ovary).

The left ovary and fallopian tube together weigh 10g.   Fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with a maximum diameter of 7mm.   Serosa is unremarkable.   Ovary is 30x20x12mm.   On sectioning through the ovary, it is partially cystic.   The cyst is up to 12mm maximum dimension.   Inner wall lining is smooth.   Representative sections are taken.

(20  left fallopian tube; 21  left ovary).   Representative sections.  (M-21).

B.  &amp;quot;R PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.   Consists of a piece of fatty tissue, it measures 30x10x5mm.   Two possible nodes are identified and embedded in one block.   Representative sections.  (M-1).

C.  &amp;quot;L PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.   Consists of fatty tissue, in aggregate 25x15x5mm.   Four possible nodes identified.

(1  one node bisected; 2  one node bisected; 3  two possible nodes).   Representative sections.  (M-3).

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BX&amp;quot;.   Consists of fatty tissue, 30x15x5mm.   Bisected.  All embedded.  (M-1/MC 18/10/2068 km).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 23/10/2068 Dr W Castro
MMRP Immunostains: There is retained nuclear staining for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 which indicates a low likelihood of high level microsatellite instability.
