CLINICAL NOTES:
Hx colorectal ca.  Metastatic.  Peritonectomy 2016 mass in R groin.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT GROIN MASS&amp;quot;. Consists of fatty pieces of tissue in aggregate 70x40x35mm.  Resection margin inked blue.  On sectioning through the largest piece there is a multicystic lesion filled with gelatinous material.  It measures 30x20x15mm.  It abuts one of the inked margins.  On sectioning the smaller pieces the cut surface is fibrofatty.  No discrete lesion is identified.

(1 one slice; 2&amp;amp;3 one composite slice; 4&amp;amp;5 one composite slice; 6&amp;amp;7 one composite slice).  RS (M-7/MC 5/9/2068 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr U Gaitan)
Sections show virtually complete replacement of a lymph node by metastatic moderately to well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is characterised by numerous pools of mucin, some partially rimmed by mildly atypical columnar mucin secreting epithelium. The tumour deposit is clear of the inked specimen margin in the sections examined.

The appearances have been compared to sections from recent previous pathology. The current tumour most strongly resembles that demonstrated in a previous right inguinal lymph node core biopsy (70G79415, 05-Nov-2067). The appearances are somewhat similar to the  adenocarcinoma documented deep to the umbilical skin (70G79415, 3/2/2069), and are not similar to the adenocarcinoma demonstrated within the axillary node biopsy (70G79415, 22/2/2066).

The appearances are consistent with origin in a primary colorectal tumour.

DIAGNOSIS:
EXCISION MASS RIGHT GROIN
- METASTATIC MODERATELY TO WELL-DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA IN A LYMPH NODE.
