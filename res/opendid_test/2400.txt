CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Family history - father bowel cancer age 44.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateraltubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 199g.  The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 50mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and is unremarkable.On sectioning the myometrium measures is up to 30mm thick and has a pale ill-defined lesion.  The tumour on the anterior surface measures 30 x 28mm.  There is also a fibroid measuring up to 25mm in maximum dimension. The cut surface of the posterior shows a pale ill-defined lesion involving the cervix, ectocervix and myometrium measuring 45mm x 10mm x 30mm. No parametrial invasion is seen.
The right fallopian tube measures 15mm in length with an outer diameter of 5mm.  The ovary measures 40mm x 25mm x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is heterogenous with golden yellowish area and also some areas of haemorrhage with cystic change measuring 30 x 15mm x 10mm.    
The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with an outer diameter of 5mm.  The ovary measures 35mm x 20mm x 15mm.  The cut surface of the ovary shows a unilocular cyst measuring up to 15mm in maximum dimension.  Inner surface is smooth with a wall thickness of up to 1mm.  The rest of the ovary is yellowish golden and tan brown.
Blocks:  1 to 6 - full length longitudinal sections of anterior uterus (1 - anterior cervix; 2 - isthmus; 3 to 6 - endometrium + myometrium + fibroid); 7 to 9 - tumour with the deepest invasion; 10 - RS of fibroid; 11 - fimbrial end; 12 - RS of right fallopian tube; 13 to 19 - cystic and haemorrhagic area of right ovary; 20 - normal looking right ovary; 21 to 26 - full length longitudinal sections of posterior; 21 - cervix; 22 - isthmus; 23 to 28 - myometrium + endometrium; 27 to 30 - tumour with deepest invasion on the posterior surface; 31 & 32 - left fallopian tube (32 - fimbrial end); 33 to 35 - cyst of left ovary; 36 - RS of normal left ovary.
B.  Specimenlabelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of a fatty tissue measuring 50mm x 49mm x 10mm.  Three lymph nodes identified.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node sliced into four slices; 2 - one lymph node sliced into fourslices; 3 - one lymph node sliced into four slices; 4 & 5 - one lymph node sliced into six slices; 6 - one lymph node sliced into five slices; 7 - one lymph node sliced into five slices; 8 - one lymph node sliced into four slices.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of a fatty tissue measuring 60mm x 45mm x 15mm.  Few lymph nodes identified.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node sliced into six slices; 2 & 3 - one lymph node sliced into three slices; 4 to 6 - one lymph node sliced into eight slices; 7 & 8 - one lymph node sliced into four slices; 9 - one lymph node.

D.Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a fatty tissue measuring 40mm x 30mm x 8mm.  The cut surface shows uniform fatty tissue.  No focal lesion is seen.  Representative sections embedded in block 1 to 3.  (TO: NA; DY/rt 6.5.65)

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr L Samit):
A. Sections show endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2, arising from the endometrium. The lesion has a complex glandular architecture, and is composed of glandspapillae lined by columnar tumour cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei.  A significant solid component is seen in approximately 10% of the lesion. No severe nuclear atypia is seen, in keeping with a grade of 2.
Several foci of lymphovascular invasion are present.
The maximum depth of invasion is 11mm in a wall 13mm thick (A28).
Invasion into the anterior and posterior cervix is present.  The lesion is 2 mm clear of the nearest anterior cervical soft tissue margin (A3).
The endometrium shows progestational changes.  Adenomyosis and leiomyomas are present.  The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN. 
The ovaries and fallopian tubes show no evidence a malignancy.  A haemorrhagic corpus luteum is present in the right ovary and a cystic follicle is present in the left ovary.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		loss of nuclear staining
PMS2		loss of nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6	nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), andmay reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
B. Sections show 7 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidenceof malignancy.
D. Sections show omental fat with no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS
A to D. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, right and left pelvic lymph nodes, omentum:
- Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2, of the endometrium, lymphovascular invasion present
- Invasion into anterior and posterior cervix, margins clear
-Maximum depth of invasion 11mm in a wall 13mm thick
- Fallopian tubes and ovaries, omentum and 12 pelvic lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
