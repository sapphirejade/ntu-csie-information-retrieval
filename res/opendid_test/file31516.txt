MRN no: 6500275
Site_name: WAGIN HOSPITAL
Facility_id: 016
Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Left breast mass.  CNB - infiltrating carcinoma.  Had wide local excision and axillary sampling (unable to localise SN on blue dye or scintigraphy).


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left breast cancer stich short superior, medium medial, long lateral&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose breast tissue with orienting sutures in situ, weighing 67g.  The specimen measures 72mm superior to inferior, 55mm medial to lateral, and 51mm superficial to deep.  The superior margin is inked red, inferior margin is inked black, superficial margin is inked green, and deep margin is inked blue.  Specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral into thirteen approximately equal slices.  There is a tumour spanning slices six to eleven, 20 x 18mm in area.  The tumour appears to be 1mm from the closest superficial margin.
Blocks: 1 - slice one (medial); 2 to 7 - slice six; 8 to 11 - slice seven (10 - IPX); 12 to 16 - slice eight; 17 to 21 - slice nine;  22 to 27 - slice ten; 28 - portion of slice eleven; 29 &amp;amp; 30 - slice thirteen (lateral).
Please refer to block diagram.

Additional block A31, inferior slice 12.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left axillary sampling&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 45 x 40 x 17mm in aggregate, containing lymph nodes.
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes as seen; 2 - single lymph node, sectioned; 3 - single lymph node, sectioned.  (TO:JB/rs 11/1/68)
