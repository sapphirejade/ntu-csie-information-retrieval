PMP - DPAM.  Peritonectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
"PERITONEAL TUMOUR, SPLEEN, COLON AND GALLBLADDER".  Specimen consists of multiple specimens.   One is a terminal ileum with attached caecum and ascending colon.  Terminal ileum measures 100mm in length and 40mm in circumference.  The wall thickness measures 3mm.  Caecum and ascending colon measures190mm in length and 75mm in circumference.  The wall thickness measures 3mm.  An attached dilated appendix is identified measuring 95mm in length and 45mm in diameter.  The attached mesentery and mesocolon measures 450x80x70mm.  Attached to the right hemicolectomy is a skin ellipse with underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue measuring 190x40x50mm.  The skinellipse measures 150x12x2mm.  Within the lumen of the appendix, mucinous necrotic tumour is noted.  Mucinous material is also seen within the mesocolon.   The mucosal surface of thesmall and large bowel is unremarkable.  No polyps or focal lesions are noted.
A spleen is identified weighing 270gm and measuring 110x100x20mm.  Serial sectioning of the spleen is unremarkable.  No focal lesions are identified.  Focal mucinous areas are noted within the adjacent fibrofatty tissue and overlying the capsule of the spleen.
A gallbladder is noted measuring 70mm in length and 40mm in diameter.  The wall thickness measures 2mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The mucosal surface is rough and granular.  It is uniformly dark green in appearance.  Thereis mild evidence of cholesterolosis.  No gallstones are noted.  No lymph node is identified. 
Multiple peritoneal fibrofatty tissues are identified measuring 220x200x35mm in aggregate.  Diffuse mucinous areas are noted throughout the peritoneal tissue.  An additional short large bowel segment is noted measuring 50mm in length and 30mm in diameter.  The wall thickness measures 3mm.  The serosal surface of the large bowel is rough and dull.  The attached mesocolon measures 50x30x25mm.  The mucosal surface of the large bowel is unremarkable.  
(1-14- from right hemicolectomy [1- proximal resection margin,  2- distal resection margin, 3- proximal longitudinal section of the appendix,  4-6- middle transverse section of the appendix,  7- distal longitudinal section of the appendix,  
8- representative normal large bowel,  9- three lymph nodes,  10- one lymph node, bisected,  11- one lymph node, bisected,  12- four lymph nodes,13-14- mucinous area within the mesocolon], 15- skin with underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue,  16-18- spleen with overlying mucinous area,  19- one lymph node within the splenic hilum, 20- neck of gallbladder,  21- body of gallbladder,  22- fundus of gallbladder,
23-25- representative mucinous areas within the peritoneal tissues,  26-27- from the short large bowel segment, [26- resection margins,  27- representative large bowel]).  Representative sections.  (M-27/WP/ab).
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr R. Chrostowski)
Sections show a low grade mucinous appendiceal tumour attached to the caecum.  The appendix is dilated and filled with mucin and shows extensive denudation of its surface epithelium and replacement of its wall by fibrous tissue with areas of dystrophic calcification.  In some areas residual surface lining mucinous epithelium with mild to moderate (low grade) dysplasia is present.  No invasive tumour into the wall of the appendix is present. 
Sections through the terminal ileum and colon show no significant abnormality.  Eight lymph nodes examined from the mesentery of theright hemicolectomy specimen show reactive changes only.  The proximal and distal surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion.  
Low grade mucinous neoplasm (pseudomyxoma peritonei)comprising of lakes of mucin dissecting through fat associated with mild to moderately dysplastic (low grade) mucin secreting epithelium is seen involving the mesocolon of the right hemicolectomy specimen, the capsule of the spleen (without extension into splenic parenchyma), fragments of separately submitted peritoneum and serosal surface of separate short segment of large bowel.  No destructive invasive tumour with desmoplastic stroma is seen. 
Sections through the gallbladder show no significant abnormality.  One splenic hilar lymph node shows reactive changes.
Sections through the skin show dermal and subcutaneous fibrosis and otherwise no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
PERITONEAL TUMOUR, SPLEEN, COLON AND GALLBLADDER :
-LOW GRADE MUCINOUS APPENDICEAL NEOPLASM ASSOCIATED WITH LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI) INVOLVING MESENTERY OF RIGHT COLON, SPLENIC CAPSULE, FRAGMENTS OF PERITONEUM, AND SEROSA OF SMALLER SEGMENT OF LARGE BOWEL.
