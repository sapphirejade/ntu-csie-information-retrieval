CLINICAL:
Liver resection.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Liver resection right" consists of a partial hepatectomy specimen 215 x 150 x 95mm.  The resection margin is inked blue.  The specimen is unorientated.  On slicing, the liver reveals three solid, pale nodules.  One nodule is 16 x 15 x 7mm and is 2mm from the closest margin.  The other two nodules are away from the first nodule and measures 20x 14 x 8 and 12 x 12 x 8mm, these two nodules are 5mm from each other.  One of these two nodules abuts the capsular surface.The closest of the two nodules to a resection margin is 38mm.
Blocks:  1 - the first nodule and resection margin; 2 & 3 - the nodule extending to capsular surface (3 - reserved block); 4 - the third nodule; 5 - liver away from the nodule.
B.  Specimen labelled "Falciform ligament" consists of an unorientated piece of fatty tissue 100 x 70 x 15mm.  The specimen is partially covered by peritoneum on one surface.  The non-peritonealized surface is inked blue.  Specimen serially sliced.  No nodules are identified.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - random sections.  (TO: UX; FC/rt 18.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr H Ruhn)
A.  Sections of liver confirmthe presence of three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The foci are subcapsular, as well as, within the liver parenchyma. Adenocarcinoma is 2.5mm from the closest line of resection. The adjacent liver shows patchy mild to moderate macrovesicular steatosis. 
Immunohistochemical stains show the carcinoma is positive for CAM5.2, CK20 (patchy) and CK19; and, negative for CK7, TTF-1, Hepar-1 and CEA (non-specific). The overall pattern of immunohistochemical staining would be in keeping with primary colorectal or upper GI origin. Negative Hepar-1 and TTF-1 make primary liver or lung origin unlikely. Correlation with clinical findings is essential. 
B.  Sections show mature fibroadipose tissue. There are no atypical features. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Liver resection (right): Three deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, clear of resection margin (2.5mm). 

B.  Falciform ligament: No evidence of malignancy.
