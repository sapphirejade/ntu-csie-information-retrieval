CLINICAL NOTES:
Right breast sentinel node for frozen section.  Right mastectomy suture medial + axilla.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Four LN, one blue + 3 pale (2 very small).

F/S:  &amp;quot;Metastasis in one of two lymph nodes at least 5mm in dimensin&amp;quot;.  Results were given by phone on 7/2/2067 by Dr. J. Gulling.

WEIGHT:  1311g
SKIN:  Yes, 230x150.
NIPPLE:  Yes, 16mm
MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  A piece of skin with underlying fatty tissue measuring 60x35x30mm.
MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard:  Anterior superior margin blue, Anterior inferior margin green, Posterior black.
DISSECTION:  Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION:  Centrally is a suspicious ill defined area with three discrete nodules and multiple smaller firm areas. This area measures 75mm superior to inferior, 60mm medial to lateral, and 20mm anterior to posterior. This entire suspicious area is 70mm from lateral margin, 65mm from medial margin, 60mm from superior, 50mm from inferior. The first discrete lesion is stellate and has a tan to fatty appearance located centrally and underlying the nipple.  It measures 35mm medial to lateral, 25mm superior to inferior, and 14mm anterior to posterior.  The lesion is 70mm from medial margin, 105mm from lateral margin, 80mm from superior margin, 70mm from inferior margin, 15mm from posterior margin, 32mm from anterior margin and from the nipple.  The second discrete lesion is 20mm lateral to the first lesion.  The lesion has a pale white cut surface and is 75mm from lateral margin, 110 from medial margin, 85mm from superior, 45 from inferior, 20mm from posterior and 32mm from anterior margin.  It is 40mm from nipple.  Between the two tumours is a firm area and multiple smaller firm areas identified.   Third discrete lesion underlies and is 19mm from the first tumour.  It is well demarcated with a tan to yellow cut surface and measures 12x10x10mm.
On sectioning through the separate piece of skin with underlying fatty tissue.  No lesion is identified.  It is not sampled. Representative sections taken.

(1&amp;amp;2  composite slices of medial half of nipple including first tumour; 3-7  further sections of first tumour [3&amp;amp;4  taken from anterior half, 5-7  from posterior half and includes posterior margin, 7  is a tumour block]; 8&amp;amp;9  second tumour taken from anterior half; 10  section between the first and second tumour; 11  second tumour in relation to posterior margin; 12-15  one sagittal slice of suspicious area taken from anterior half of breast; 16  well demarcated lesion underlying first tumour taken from anterior half; 17  further section of suspicious area taken from posterior half of breast; 18  upper outer quadrant; 19  lower outer quadrant; 20  upper inner quadrant; 21  lower inner quadrant).  RS (M-21).

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT AXILLARY CLEARANCE&amp;quot;.  Consists of fatty tissue measuring 70x50x20mm.  Fifteen possible nodes identified ranging from 2 to 40mm.

(1-4  one lymph node; 5  one lymph node bisected; 6  one lymph node bisected; 7  one lymph node bisected; 8  two possible lymph nodes; 9  four possible nodes; 10  three possible nodes; 11  four possible nodes).  RS (M-11/MC 11/2/2070 km).
