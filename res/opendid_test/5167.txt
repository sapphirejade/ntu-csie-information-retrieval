HISTORY:  
Uterus, tubes, rectum.  Recurrent CRC.  Peritonectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEUM, OMENTUM, RECTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES + OVARIES".  
Omentum - A segment of omentum measuring up to 310x190x12mm.  There are some firm haemorrhagic areas but no definite tumour is identified.  
(1-3 RS). 
Peritoneum  with attached uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and rectum - The peritoneumshows no suspicious areas apart from the Pouch of Douglas which shows ulcerated area and possible tumour extending to the serosa of the posterior uterus and an ulcerated transmural area in the rectum.  The rectum measures 150mm in lengthand the distal resection margin is at least below the anterior peritoneal reflection.  The uterus measures up to 60mm from medial to lateral, 90mm from fundus to cervix and 45mm from anterior to posterior.  The right fallopian tube measures up to 80mm in length and 8mm in external diameter and 7mm in external diameter. The right ovary measures up to 25x20x15mm.  The left fallopian tube measures up to 60mm in length and 8mm in external diameter. The left ovary measuresup to 25x25x15mm.  The ulcerated area of rectum has a defect of 25mm diameter and this is located 40mm from the distal resection margin (inked black). The perirectal fat is inked blue.  The ulcerated defect at rectum is below the anterior peritoneal reflection.  The rectal mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  The Pouch of Douglas area adherent to the uterus is inked red.  The proximal rectal resection margin is inked red.  On sectioning the endometrium measures 2mm andthe myometrium measures 21mm.  There is a 10mm diameter fibroid on the anterior myometrium.  The cervix is unremarkable.  On sectioning the left ovary is macroscopically involved by tumour.   
(4 LS proximal resection margin; 5 LS distal resection margin; 6-11 ulcerated area of rectum at anterior peritoneal reflection; 12 LS and TS right fallopian tube; 13-15 right ovary all embedded; 16 LS and TS left fallopian tube; 17 representative left ovary; 18-20 anterior cervix to fundus; 21-24 posterior cervix to fundus [22 with red ink adherent peritoneal tumour]; 25 further representative posterior cervix with peritoneal tumour; 26 one sectioned possible node separate in specimen container; 27 sixpossible perirectal fat nodes; 28 mesenteric fat with possible nodes; 29 one possible node; 30&31 tumour reserve block 1 and 2 [left ovary]).  RS (M-31/FM/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Y Jacinthe)
Sections of the omentum show haemorrhage and congestion.  There is focal fibrosis with myofibroblasts proliferation.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in five lymph nodes identified.  
Sections from the rectum at the ulcerated area show infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  There is tumour present on the free serosal surface and associated with perforation.  There is extensive lymphatic permeation.  Focal perineural involvement is identified.  The colonic mucosa at the edge of the tumour shows no dysplasia.  Both proximal and distal resection margins show no evidence of tumour.  The tumour is mostly within subserosal fat and muscularis propria, with focal extension into lamina propria.  
The right ovary shows a focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  A haemorrhagic corpus luteum is identified.  The left ovary is almost replaced by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  
Both fallopian tubes show no evidence of tumour involvement.  
Sections of cervix show Nabothian cysts.  The endometrium shows secretory activity.  There is focal adenomyosis.  In the posterior fundus, metastatic carcinoma is identified involving the serosal surface.  This focus is adherent to the attachedperitoneum.  There is also tumour involving the posterior cervix serosa.  
Metastatic carcinoma is seen on 1 out of 7 lymph nodes within the perirectal fat.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEUM, OMENTUM, RECTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES -
- RECURRENT COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA WITH PERFORATION
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING BOTH OVARIES, UTERUS AND CERVIX
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN 1 OUT OF 12 LYMPH NODES IDENTIFIED.
