HISTORY:  
DPAM.  Previous low grade ovarian mucinous carcinoma.  
Spleen, gallbladder, diaphragm, peritoneum, hemicolectomy, small bowel resection, pelvic side wall lymph node, para-aortic lymph node, left iliac lymph nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"LEFT, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM ANTERIOR RESECTION, OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, SMALL BOWEL".  
A.  Gallbladder - The gallbladderis 60x25mm and has mucinous tumour on the serosal surface.
(1 gallbladder).
Two pieces of large bowel attached by fatty tissue. The two pieces are 120x40mm and 110x40mm respectively.  Both are covered extensively with mucinous tumour. The walls are 5mm and the mucosal surface of both are unremarkable.
(2-4 sections of bowel wall)
A large piece of tissue consisting of omental caking, large and small bowel and spleen all attached measuring approximately 330x130x50mm.  The spleen is 100x80x25mm and has mucinous tumour on the surface. The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  The small bowel is slightly looped forming a mass 150x110x60mm.  Mucinous tumour is presenton the surface.  There is hard mesh on one surface which is partially 130x80mm. The large bowel is attached to the area of mesh and is approximately 300x40mm. There is a large amount of caking attached on the surface.
(5&6 spleen; 7&8 small bowel; 9-11 large bowel with caking)
Multiple pieces of tissue including ? diaphragm and peritoneum have an aggregate of 230x200x30140mm.  Most of the pieces of tissue are covered with mucinous tumour.  
(12-15 selections from multiple pieces of tissue including diaphragm).  RS (M-15)
B.  "PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE".  Two nodular pieces of tissue with attached fatty tissue. The nodules are 20x10x10mm and 20x10x5mm respectively.
(1 first nodule; 2&3 second nodule).  RS (4-3)
C.  "PELVIC SIDE WALL".  Solid tan nodule 20x10x5mm serially transversely sliced.  AE (3-2)
D.  "LEFT ILIAC LYMPH NODE".  Nodular mucinous tissue 30x20x10mm.  AE (3-3/BI/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (W Schrawder)
A.  The section of the gallbladder shows normal appearing mucosa and wall and with deposits of extracellular mucus on the serosal surface.  These are associated with strips and sheets of epithelial cells with mucin vacuoles with intermediate nuclear grade including nuclear membrane and shape irregularities and nucleoli.  Apoptotic figures are also seen.
Sections of the described segments of large bowel show serosal adhesions. The mucosa and bowel wall appear unremarkable. On the serosal surface there are numerous extracellular mucin pools associated with sheets and strips of epithelium with intermediate to high grade cytology.
The spleen shows normal appearing parenchyma and numerous extracellular pools of mucus on the capsular surface.  Within these there is sheets and strips of epithelium with intermediate to high grade cytology.
The next described segments of small and large bowel show serosal adhesions with extracellular mucus pools associated with intermediate to high grade mucinous epithelium and these infiltrate in association with mucin pools into the muscularis propria of the bowel.  There are also mucin pools on the serosa of the large boweland within the omentum associated with cytologically intermediate to high grade epithelium and focal infiltrative pattern tumour within fat.
Sections of the separate piece of tissue showfibrofatty tissue and focal skeletal muscle and smooth muscle and these are involved by mucinous tumour with abundant extracellular mucin pools with intermediate to high grade cytology of the associated epithelium.  In addition a lymph node that is replaced by mucinous tumour is also identified.
B. The sections show two nodule representing lymph nodes that are replaced by mucinous tumour with intermediate to high grade cytology.  
C.  The sectionsshow lymph node with reactive changes.
D.  The sections show adipose tissue including probable lymph node that is being replaced by mucinous tumour. 
Comment : The appearances are those of mucinous adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  DIAPHRAGM, OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL -
-MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.
B.  PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE -
-MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.
C.  LEFT PELVIC SIDE WALL -
-LYMPH NODE WITH REACTIVE CHANGE.
D.  LEFT ILIAC LYMPH NODE -
-MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA.
