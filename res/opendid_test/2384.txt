CLINICAL:
Vulval lesions on background of vulval SCC and VIN.  Wide local excision of following lesions.
1.  Right vulva.
2.  Left lateral margin - stitch anterior at 12 o'clock.
3.  Left vulva and lower vagina - stitch at 12 o'clock. 
Vulval squamous cell carcinoma.   
Post TKR.  Renal impairment.  Hypertension.  Gout.  Psoriasis.  Hyperlipidemia.  

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Stitch at 12 o'clock left vulva and lower vagina" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with overlying mucosa measuring in total 50 x 35 x 8mm.  The mucosal surface is roughly triangular in shape and measures 35 x 27mm.  There is a suture at one edge designated 12 o'clock.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock margin black with the overlying soft tissue superficial surface red.  The surface of the mucosa appears rough with overlying fibrin, however no distinct lesionis identified.  Specimen AE in twelve blocks from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock.  (1 to 5 - soft tissue superiorly).  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Anterior stitch 12 o'clock left lateral margin" consists of a length of mucosa measuring 38 x 7 x 5mm.  There is a stitch at one end designated 12 o'clock.  The surface mucosa appears unremarkable and no distinct lesion is identified.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9 o'clock margin black.  Specimen serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into ten blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right vulva" consists of an unorientated piece of mucosa measuring 22 x 13 x 10mm.  The surface appears unremarkable.  The deep aspect is inked black.  The specimenis serially sectioned and AE in five blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr V Ary): 
A.  Sections show vulval intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (VIN 3) which extends to the 6 o'clock mucosal resection margin.  Fragments of VIN 3 are also seen within ulcerated tissue extending towards the 9 o'clock resection margin.  VIN 2 also extends to the 3 o'clock and 12 o'clock mucosal resection margins.  No invasive malignancy is seen.  
B.  Sections of vulva show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. 
C.  Sections of vulva show features of HPV infection.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Left vulva and lower vagina:  VIN3 and VIN2,margins involved.
B.  Left lateral margin:  No significant abnormality. 
C.  Right vulva:  HPV effect.
