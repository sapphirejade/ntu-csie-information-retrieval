DR NORMAN DOMINICA Cristobal-Telles
Distribution:     FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Right breast mucinous carcinoma.  Right axilla sentinel node biopsy.  Right breast carcinoma suture short superior long lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel lymph node" and consists of a lymph node measuring 25 x 20 x 15mm with a small amount of attached adipose tissue.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable (imprints made).
Blocks: 1 & 2 - lymph node AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Malignant cells present.  
Result to Anaesthetist/Dr A Mandril by Dr A Vigueras at 7:47pm on 19/01/66.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast long lateral, short superior" and consists of a mastectomy measuring 170mm (medial to lateral) x 165mm (inferior to superior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.  There is an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 65 x 35mm which includes a nippleareola complex measuring 30 x 30mm.  The nipple appears slightly retracted.  In the 9 to 10 o'clock position 65mm from the nipple there is a firm cream cystic heterogeneous firm lesion measuring 40mm (medial to lateral) x 50mm (inferiorto superior) x 20mm (superficial to deep).  The lesion is 5mm from the deep margin and 12mm from the inferiosuperficial margin and 55mm from the lateral margin and well clear of the medial margin.  No other suspicious areas are identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 6 - full face of tumour to deep inferior and superficial margins; 7 & 8 - further tumour to deep margin; 9 & 10 - further tumour; 11 & 12 - inner upper quadrant; 13 & 14 - inner lower quadrant; 15 & 16 - outer upper quadrant; 17 & 18 -  outer lower quadrant; 19 - nipple and tissue deep to nipple; 20 - reserve block. 
Please refer to attached diagram.  (GD/ta 18/1/66)
