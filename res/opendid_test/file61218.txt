MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;.
The specimen consists of a uterus with both tubes and ovaries attached, total weight 130g. The uterus measures 90mm fundus to cervix, 60mm left to right and 40mm anterior to posterior.
- The right tube is 70mm long and 5mm diameter with a small 5mm diameter firm nodule to the fimbrial end. There is an adjacent right paratubal cyst 40mm long x 25mm diameter which is thin walled and contains clear fluid.
- The right ovary is 30x20x10mm and shows no focal lesions.
- The left tube is 40x5mm and has a small 6mm firm pale nodule at the fimbrial end.
- The left ovary is 25x15x10mm and shows no focal lesions apart from some small surface thin walled cysts.
- The uterus serosal surface is normal.
- There is pale soft ?tumour tissue involving the anterior and posterior uterine body, fundus and extending towards lower uterine segment. The tumour is about 30mm diameter. The tumour is soft and friable. In the uterine body the pale tissue is about 15mm thickness into myometrium of total thickness 22mm. Endocervical involvement is not seen.

Other specimens:
D. 5 OMENTAL BIOPSY:
There is one detached cluster of epithelial cells in blood clot in one section, of uncertain significance. The omentum tissue proper is normal with no tumour involvement.
PATHOLOGICAL FIGO STAGE:
- Please review at MDT
- Myometrial invasion &amp;gt;50%  and positive pelvic nodes reported above, favour IIIC1
COMMENT(S):
The sentinel node deposits in right pelvic sentinel nodes consist of small papillary clusters of tumour cells in sinus tissue. The largest single cluster is about 20 cells. Multiple clusters are present. Several of the clusters are closely adjacent and overall considered to represent a confluent micrometastasis rather than isolated tumour cells.
DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, Bilateral Tubes and Ovaries:
- endometrioid carcinoma of endometrium;
- FIGO grade 1;
- myometrial invasion present (9mm invasion of 12mm myometrium, 75%);
- distance of myoinvasive tumour to serosa: 3mm
- lymphovascular Invasion, extensive;
- tumour shows normal staining for MMR proteins and is ER+, PR+;
- benign changes left and right fallopian tubes and ovaries;

B. 2 Right Pelvic Sentinel Node:
- sentinel nodes involved by micrometastasis (2 of 6 nodes positive) and one node with isolated tumour cells;
- maximum dimension of largest lymph node metastasis: 0.3mm;
- see comment(s) on node deposits.

C. 3. Left Pelvic Sentinel Node;
- sentinel node negative for tumour involvement (0/1)

D. 5 Omental Biopsy:
- one detached cluster of epithelial cells in blood clot of uncertain significance;
