CLINICAL:
Right hemi-liver, history of anal SCC.  ? primary, ? metastasis. 
Additional information obtained:  Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the rectum, Pathology HAPS, KATANNING, 25/1/66.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right hemi-liver", consists of a hemihepatectomy measuring 180 x 145 x 130mm.  The hepatic resection margin is inked black. There is a slightly roughened area over one end measuring 110 x 65mm, ? bare area which is inked blue.  The cut surface reveals a well circumscribed cream tumour taking up the majority of the specimen measuring 125 x 105 x 100mm.  The tumour appears to come close to the capsular surface and is 2mm fromthe hepatic resection margin. The ? bare area which is inked blue and appears 4mm clear of tumour.  The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.  Blocks 1 & 2 - liver to resection margin; 3 & 4 - liver to capsule; 5 & 6 - liver to uninvolved liver; 7 - tumour to ? bare area; 8 & 9 - further representative tumour; 10 - uninvolved liver; 11 - reserve block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder", consists of a gallbladder which was received intact measuring 75mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 35mm. Theserosa appears unremarkable. The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm. The mucosa appears unremarkable.  No gallstones are identified.  Block 1 - body;  2- fundus; 3 - shave cystic duct margin and neck.  (JN/ec 12.8.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Shakespeare & registrar Dr Q Crilly):
A.  Sections of liver show a tumour consisting of nests and trabeculae of basaloid cells with large areas of necrosis.  Small areas of keratinisation are seen.  The tumour cells are round to elongated with occasional peripheral palisading.  The tumour cells show positive staining with panCK, CK5/6 and CD56.  The Hepar-1 stain is negative.  The appearancesare consistent with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with basaloid features and would be consistent with metastasis from the previously reported squamous cell carcinoma of the anorectum.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion isseen.  The tumour does not breach the liver capsule and is clear of the surgical resection margin by 2.5mm.  The uninvolved liver shows mild steatosis.
B.  Sections show mild thickening of the gall bladder wall due to muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis and patchy chronic inflammation.  Focal Rokitansky Aschoff sinusformation is present.  The appearance is consistent with mild chronic cholecystitis.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right hemi-hepatectomy:
- Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with basaloid features.
- Consistent with metastasis from anorectum.
- Margins appear clear.
B.  Gallbladder:  Mild chronic cholecystitis.
