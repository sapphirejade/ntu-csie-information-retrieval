Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Low grade serous recurrence.  Stage 3B low grade serous ovarian carcinoma on a background of serous borderline 2063.  Now arising Ca 125 =57.  Increasing ovarian size on US.  Epilepsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Liver capsule" and consists of multiple fragments of tan/pale grey tissue ranging in size from 5mm to 30mm in maximum dimension.  On sectioning, nodules of pale grey and tan tumouris identified within fibroadipose tissue and hepatic tissue.  RS 3 blocks.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Diaphragm nodule" and consists of four irregularly shaped fragments of tan and pale grey tissue measuring 8 to 20mm in maximum dimension.  Tumour nodules are identified macroscopically.  AE 2 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Right diaphragm" and consists of a piece of pale grey and tan tissue measuring 24 x 14 x 10mm.  A tumour is not identified macroscopically.  AE 2 blocks.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental nodule" and consists of a tumour nodule measuring 14 x 11 x 9mm partly enveloped by omental tissue (22mm in width).  AE 2 blocks.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" and consists of two pale grey fragments of tissue measuring 7 and 9mm.  AE 1 block.  (SR/ta 18/2/66) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr W Sagayaga): 
A.  Sections of liver show metastatic serous adenocarcinomawith predominantly low grade features however, some tumour cells show moderate cytological atypia with large nucleoli raising the possibility of a high grade component.  A few serous implants are noted within adjacent fibroadipose tissue.
B.  Sections show skeletal muscle and liver containing tumour with similar features to that seen within specimen A.
C.  Sections show skeletal muscle and adjacent fibrous tissue containing small deposits of metastatic low grade serous adenocarcinoma.
D.  Sections of omentum show serous adenocarcinoma with predominantly low grade features however, moderate cytological atypia similar to that seen within specimen A is present, raising thepossibility of a high grade component.  The ER stain is strongly positive and there is moderate staining with PR within approximately 40% of tumour cells.
E.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show small nests of tumour cells consistent with serous adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - E.  Liver, diaphragm, omentum and sigmoid:
- Metastatic serous adenocarcinomawith predominantly low grade features involving liver capsule, diaphragm, omentum and sigmoid colon.
- Possible high grade component.
Tissue will be submitted for KRAS and BRAF mutation testing as requested.
