Peritoneal nodule, appendix; lumen opened by surgeon. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "APPENDIX". An opened appendix with gelatinous material in it. The appendix measures 100x25x25mm. The wall thickness is 3mm. 
(1 LS of the proximal margin; 2-17RS of appendix; 18&19 RS of gelatinous material). RS (M-19).
B. "PERITONEAL NODULE". A piece of tissue measuring 10x10x5mm. AE (1-1/DBh/t).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr O Sarni)
A. Sections through the appendix show a low grade mucinous neoplasm resulting in appendiceal mucocele. No extra-appendiceal extension of mucin or cells is seen. The proximal surgical margin of resection is clear of the neoplasm. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
B.  Sections show fibrous and smooth muscle tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
APPENDIX:  
LOW GRADE APPENDICEALMUCINOUS NEOPLASM CONFINED TO APPENDIX. 
PERITONEAL NODULE:  AREAS OF FIBROSIS.
