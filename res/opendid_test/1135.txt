CLINICAL:
Large bowel obstruction.  Extended right hemicolectomy.  Transverse colon polyp.  Diarrhoea for  8/9.  RX with metronidazole.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a hemicolectomy with a length of colon measuring 350mm in length with an attached section of terminal ileum 40mm.  60mm from the distal end there is an obstructing tumour over a length of bowel 15mmwhich takes up approximately 50% of the circumference of the bowel.  The cut surface reveals a cream tumour appearing to invade into the muscularis propria but not through it.  Near the ileocaecal valve in thecaecum there is a sessile polyp 15 x 15mm.  200mm from the distal end there is a further sessile polyp 30 x 20mm.  A further small polyp 5mm is identified.  All polyps appear confined to the mucosa.  The remainder of the right colon appears dilated and oedematis.  A small piece of mesentery 60 x 35 x 8mm in included.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  
Blocks: 1 - margins; 2 - tumour to uninvolved mucosa; 3 to 8 - tumour AE; 9 & 10 -polyp near the ileocaecal valve; 11 - other sessile polyp; 12 - small polyp;  13 - apical lymph node; 14 to 16 - remainder of nodes; 17 - tumour for tumour banking.
B.  Specimen labelled "Bowel polyp" consists of a polyp 7mm.  BAE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr F Serpe):
A & B.  Sections show two foci of adenocarcinoma.  The first designated tumour 1 is situated within the ascending colon and the other tumour designated tumour 2 is within the caecum. The features are as follows:
Tumour 1

Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Ascending colon. 	
Maximum tumour diameter:  15mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  60mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:   No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT4a	Tumour penetrates the surface of the visceral peritoneum
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Tumour 2

Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Caecum. 	
Maximum tumour diameter:  15mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  40mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:   No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent


Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  11	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Sessile serrated adenoma
Serrated adenoma with low grade epithelial dysplasia (Specimen B)
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status

Tumour 1	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Tumour 2
MLH1		Equivocal
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2		Equivocal
MSH6		Loss of nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatchrepair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
