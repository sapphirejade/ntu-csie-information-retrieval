CLINICAL:
VIN.  Anterior skinning vulvectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Anterior vulva stitch at 12 o'clock" consists of an excision of vulva, 17 x 27 x 2mm.  At one end there is a suture denoting 12 o'clock.  Centrally, there is a pale white keratotic nodule 10 x 10mm with surrounding slightly raised white plaque abutting the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins.  The lesion measures 21 x 15mm in total.  3 o'clock half is inked blue and 9 o'clock half is inked black.  The depth of the lesion is 1.5mm.  AE.
Blocks:  1 to 7 - 12 o'clock margin (serially embedded from 3 to 9 o'clock); 8 to 11 - TS across the lesion, serially embedded from 12 to 6 o'clock; 12 to 21 - 6 o'clock margin, serially embedded from 3 to 9 o'clock.  (TO: EDDIE; Leandro/rt 21.10.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Armel):
Sections show extensive VIN 3.  VIN is clear of the 12 o'clock margin by 2mm, the 
6 o'clock margin by 3mm and the 9 o'clock margin by 4mm.  It is well clear of the 
3 o'clock margin.  There is no evidence of invasion.
IN ADDITION, the upper dermal stroma and vessels contain amorphous deposits which stain strongly with Congo Red and show apple green birefringence consistent with amyloid.   The presence of amyloid in the skin may be a localised finding with no clinical significance or it may be a manifestation of systemic amyloidosis.  Referral to exclude systemic amyloidosis is strongly recommended.
This report was discussed with Dr N. Leona at 15:15 on 23/10/65.
DIAGNOSIS:
Anterior vulva:  VIN 3.  Amyloid (see above).
