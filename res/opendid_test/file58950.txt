Thickness of mesocolon:  up to 25mm
Appendix:  50mm in length x 7mm in diameter

Tumour
Location:  Within ascending colon, 10mm away from ileocaecal valve
Description:  Fungating
Maximum tumour diameter:  50mm
Perforation:  Absent
Appearance of serosa overlying tumour:  Intact

Other
Polyps:  Three polypoid lesions, 4 - 7mm across within the ascending colon.  The closest to any margins is more than 35mm away from distal cut end.

Other:  There are five diverticula located within ascending colon, extending 15mm from tumour to distal margin (see slide 2).
Inked margins:  Proximal inked black and distal inked blue.

Blocks

20 - six possible lymph nodes; 21 - tumour for tissue bank.  (TO:KN/rs 9/11/71)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Faul and Dr Q Zeringue):

BOWEL CANCER PROFORMA

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
T3	Beyond muscularis propria

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  15
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0

N0	No regional LN metastasis

Lymphovascular invasion
Absent

Perineural invasion
Absent

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
Diverticula are seen.
One tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia is present.

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry
