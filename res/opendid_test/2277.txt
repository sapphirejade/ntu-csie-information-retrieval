HISTORY:
Ca ovary Completed chemotherapy. Omentum, uterus, tubes and ovaries. Pouch of Douglas.
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES, POUCH OF DOUGLAS". Uterus with cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, there are two pieces of fibrofattytissue free floating in the container. The uterus with cervix measure 52x30x25mm. The specimen weighs 52g. The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with diameter up to 6mm. The right ovary measures 20x11x8mm. The left fallopiantube measures 40mm in length with diameter up to 6mm. The left ovary measures 13x10x8mm. The free floating pieces of fibrofatty tissue measure 60x25x10mm and 60x25x10mm. On close inspection, there are multiple small granular deposits on the peritoneum of the anterior peritoneal resection and on the peritoneum of Pouch of Douglas as well as the serosal surface of the posterior uterus, which probably is represented by the free floating pieces of tissue. The deposits measure from 1-2mm. 
(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 anterior; 4 posterior body; 5 anterior fundus; 6 posterior fundus; 7&8 RS of the posterior body of the uterus with serosal depositions of the tumour; 8&9 TS of the right fallopian tube; 10&11 LS of the right fimbrial end and the whole tube is embedded; 12&13 TS of the right ovary, whole ovary embedded; 14 right parametrial tissue; 15 RS of the anterior peritoneal resection with possible deposition of tumour; 16&17 TS of the left fallopian tube; 18 LS of the left fimbrial end, the whole left tube embedded; 19&20 TS of the left ovary, whole left ovary embedded; 21 left parametrial tissue; 22&23 Representative TS of the piece of tissue free floating no. 1; 24&25 RS of the second free floating piece of tissue). RS (M-25).
B. "OMENTUM". Two pieces of fibrofatty tissue, measuring 70x25x10mm and 100x40x30mm.On the sectioning the pieces of fat appear to be infiltrated by the pale white lesion.  
(1-3 RS of the piece of tissue no.1; 4&5 RS from second piece of tissue). RS (M-5/SS/th).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr P Fune)
A.  Sections show extensive involvement by high grade serous papillary carcinoma. There is involvement of bilateral fallopian tubes including bilateral fimbrial ends. There is minimal surface involvement of bilateral ovaries, and focal parenchymal involvement of the right ovary. There is involvement of the anterior and posterior (Pouch of Douglas) peritoneum together with involvement of bilateral parametria. There is also involvement of all of the sampled fragments of separate tissue, of presumed peritoneal origin. Carcinoma is characterised by areas of solid architecture, other areas with slit like spaces and psammoma bodies, together with surface papillary formations. Immunostains for p53 show strong positive nuclear staining. The proliferative index on Ki-67 is 5-10%. 
Sections of anterior and posterior cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show atrophy with mild cystic change, and sections of the myometrium are unremarkable. 
COMMENT: The carcinoma is most likely of fallopian tube origin.
B.  Sections show large deposits of high grade serous carcinoma within the omental fat, with appearances as described in specimen A. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERALOVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES, POUCH OF DOUGLAS, PERITONEUM -
- HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA INVOLVING BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES, BILATERAL OVARIES, BILATERAL PARAMETRIA, SEROSAL SURFACE OF THE UTERUSAND SAMPLED PERITONEUM.
 
B.  OMENTUM - BULKY INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA.
