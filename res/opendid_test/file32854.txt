Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Left adnexal cyst and left hydrosalpinx.  PPH.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left fallopian tube&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube measuring 60 x 8mm with a shiny serosal surface.  No lesion is seen on sectioning.  All of fallopian tube embeded in 3 blocks.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left ovarian cyst wall&amp;quot;, consists of multiple fragments of irregular tan tissue measuring 30 x 19 x 7mm in aggregate.  The tissue possible represents cyst wall but measures up to 4mm thick.  The presumed inner lining has a heterogeneous tan and haemorrhagic appearance.  No solid areas are identified.  AE 3 blocks.  (TO:AP/rs 28/1/66)


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr U Isabelle)
A.  Sections of fallopian tube wall show no significant abnormality, including no evidence of hydrosalpinx or acute salpingitis. Adjacent to the fallopian tube are thin fragments of tissue, partially lined by attenuated epithelium, possibly representing a collapsed/fragmented benign (serous) paratubal cyst. There are no atypical features. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Sections of the left ovary show changes suggestive of a follicular cyst. There are focal adhesions. There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative slides seen with Dr U Radwick.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left fallopian tube: Possible fragmented paratubal cyst. No evidence of hydrosalpinx, acute salpingitis or malignancy.

B.  Left ovarian cyst wall: Favour follicular cyst.
