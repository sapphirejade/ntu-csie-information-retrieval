HISTORY:  
Appendix tumour.  Jelly belly.  PMP.  Peritonectomy.  Omentum, right colon, peritoneum.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
"RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE".  
Omentum.  The omentum is approximately 550x120x20mm.  There is no mucin seen on the surface and there is an area of firm fatty tissue about 100mm in diameter.  
(1-5 omentum;
There is also strips of peritoneum with attached fatty tissue.  The largest strip is 100x60x20mm and the other strip is 250mm in length, 20-40mm in width and 10mm in thickness.  No tumour is present onthe surfaces.
6-10 strips of peritoneum and surrounding fatty tissue;
Terminal ileum, caecum appendix and ascending colon:  The terminal ileum is 90x15mm and the caecum and ascending colon is 140x30mm.  The appendix is 40 by 6 mm and dilated to 12 mm at the tip.  In close proximity to the appendix, there is mucin forming a soft jelly-like mass which is 35x20x15mm.  It is approximately 10mm away from the caecum.  
11 terminal ileum and ascending colon resection margins; 12 caecal stump; 13-16 Appendix tip/shaft; 17-22 sections of mucinous tumour; 23-25 lymph nodes [23 two nodes, 24 three nodes, 25 three nodes]).  RS (M-25/BI/nh) Further tissue 26-29 Base of appendix M-4 RS BI
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Z Larranaga)  
Sections through the appendix show a low-grade mucinous neoplasm involving the appendiceal mucosa. The appendix wall appears intact with no evidence of dissecting mucin deposits. 
Sections through periappendicealfat, caecal mesentery, separately submitted peritoneal fragments and omentum show deposits of low-grade mucinous neoplasm comprising of extracellular lakes of mucin associated with low-grade mucinous neoplasm. The colonic and small bowel(ileal) mucosa shows no focal abnormality. Seven local lymph nodes recovered from the right hemicolectomy specimen show reactive changes. 
No destructive tumour invasion with desmoplastic stroma is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:  
RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
	LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI) INVOLVING PERIAPPENDICEAL ADIPOSE TISSUE, CAECAL MESENTERY, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM.
	APPENDICEAL LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
