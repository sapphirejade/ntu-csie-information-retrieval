CLINICAL NOTES:
G II endometrioid adenoca.
1. Peritoneal washing for cyto.
2. Uterus, tubes, ovaries.
3. Right pelvic sentinel node.
4. Left pelvic sentinel node.
5. Omentum biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of a uterus attached cervix, ovaries, tubes weighing 107g altogether.  Uterus measures 80x50x35mm.  Ectocervix 35x30mm bearing a slit like os 10mm across.  Serosa is smooth grey.  Specimen received opened coronally.  Anterior cervix inked blue, posterior black. There is an endometrial lobulated irregular white lesion, measuring approximately 15x25x5mm. It is 5mm thick Out of 15mm thickness of anterior wall. No obvious extension to the cervix present.
Posterior wall measures 20mm.  There is a white whorled intramural nodule in the posterior wall 10mm.  Right tube measures 50mm in length 5mm diameter.  Serosa is smooth and grey.  Parafimbrial cyst present otherwise sectioning is unremarkable.  Right ovary measures 35x15x10mm.
Left tube measures 40mm in length 7mm diameter.  Serosa is grey and smooth. Sectioning is unremarkable.  Left ovary 20x15x7mm.  Sectioning is unremarkable.  Both anterior and posterior portion of the specimen serially sliced.

(1 right tube; 2 right ovary; 3 left tube; 4 left ovary; 5 right parametrium; 6 left parametrium; 7-9 one full face sagittal and serial wall; 10&amp;amp;11 more section of endometrium tumour; 12-14 one full face posterior wall; 15-17 one section of the tumour).  RS (M-17)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Multiple fibrofatty tissue measuring 10x7x5mm containing two lymph nodes 5mm each.  RS (2-1)

C.  &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of a lymph node 12mm, serially sliced.  AE (M-1)

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Consists of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40x30x10mm.  No nodule or lymph node identified.  RS (M-2/SM 30/10/2067 ank)

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (11/2/70):
Immunostains for MSI proteins (EAST SURGICAL KURRI KURRI DISTRICT HOSPITAL; block: A11)
MLH1:  Absent staining
PMS2:  Absent staining
MSH2:  Positive staining present
MSH6:  Positive staining present

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.

Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
