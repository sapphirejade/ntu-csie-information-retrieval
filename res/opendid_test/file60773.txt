HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
HAWKER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
GII endometrioid adenoCa.
1. Peritoneal washings for Cyto
Histo:
2. Uterus tubes and ovaries
3. Right sentinel pelvic nodes.
4. Left sentinel pelvic nodes.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of a radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy specimen received partially opened weighing 150g. The uterus and cervix measures 80x50x35mm with a smooth serosal surface with two possible subserosal nodules 5 and 7mm. The cervix measures 35x35mm with a 10mm normal appearing slit-like os. The fimbriated right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 5mm in width with a 25mm simple clear fimbriated cyst attached. The right ovary measures 25x15x5mm. The left fimbriated fallopian tube measures 60mm and is up to 5mm in width. There is a 12mm clear simple parafimbrial cyst. The left ovary measures 30x20x7mm. The anterior margin is inked blue, posterior - black. Specimen is cut into six parasagittal sections from right to left. The cut surface reveals  endomyometrium that is up to 10mm in maximal thickness posteriorly. There is a predominantly exophytic poorly fixed lesion measuring up to 40mm x 20mm in the posterior body that may be superficially invasive of the myometrium [photograph and block diagram are created].
(1 right parametrial shave; 2 left parametrial shave; 3 and 4 right fallopian tube and ovary, fimbriated end all embedded; 5 and 6 left fallopian tube and ovary, fimbriated end all embedded; 7 and 8 tumour and lower uterine segment from Slice 3; 9-17 entire Slice 4; 18,19 and 20 transverse sections of tumour edge to left parametrium).Further blocks 21-22 anterior cervix and lower uterine segment; 23 posterior cervix. Representative sections (M-23)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of fatty tissue 20x15x3mm with a possible 2mm lymph node. All embedded. (M-1)
C. &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple fragments of fibrofatty tissue 25x20x3mm in aggregate with a possible 3mm lymph node. All embedded. (M-1/MY 17/10/2070 cy)

SENTINEL LYMPH NODES:
Specimen B - Right Sentinel Node; and Specimen C - Left Sentinel Node
Number of nodes with macrometastasis (&amp;gt; 2 mm): 0
Number of nodes with micrometastasis (greater than 0.2 mm and up to 2 mm): 0
Number of nodes with isolated tumor cells (0.2 mm or less): 0 (AE1/AE3 are negative)

ANCILLARY STUDIES/IMMUNOSTAINS:
MMRP Immunostains. Performed previously on endometrial biopsy at Seals Pathology (See DAY SURGERY UNIT Report 83921-37SV).
Other: Block for biobank/further testing if required (A14)
PATHOLOGIC FIGO Stage (2015 FIGO Cancer Report): II: Tumor invades cervical stroma, but does not extend beyond the uterus
PATHOLOGIC STAGE CLASSIFICATION (pTNM, AJCC 8th ed):
pT2: Tumor invading the stromal connective tissue of the cervix but not extending beyond the uterus.
