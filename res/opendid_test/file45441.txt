Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Postmenopausal left adnexal mass 3 x 1cm.  Peritoneal disease.  Ca 125 46.  Perimenopausal implanon in situ.  Nil breakthrough bleeding.  Left pelvic mass.  Peritoneal nodules.  Ca 125 46.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube measuring 60mm, and ovary 20 x 12 x 8mm.  There is a lesion ? arising from the tube, 35 x 25 x 20mm.  Two RS taken for frozen section.  The mass has a homogenous pale appearance, and the ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  Blocks: 1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 to 5 - LS presumed fimbrial end; 6 - RS pale mass adjacent to fallopian tube; 7 - two TS ovary, RS TS uninvolved fallopian tube; 8 - RS pale lesion; 9 - RS at adnexal tissue.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
High grade carcinoma favour serous.
Result phoned to Dr Anaesthetist by Dr Q Dibert / Dr Q Khosravi at 3:30pm on 18/06/70.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, and right fallopian tube and ovary weighing 76g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 75 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 36mm in length and 3mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 26 x 8 x 13mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left parametrium measures 23 x 45 x 13mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  In the posterior lower uterine segment / cervical region is a pale broad based lobulated lesion measuring 6 x 10mm.  There is a firm tan area loosely attached adjacent the right ectocervix on the posterior aspect measuring 13 x 12 x 4mm. There are multiple fibroids in the myometrium ranging from 4 to 9mm. Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 - RS fibroid anterior right myometrium; 5 to 7 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 8 - RS polypoid tissue in posterior ectocervix region; 9 - two RS TS pale firm area right ectocervix; 10 - RS posterior left endomyometrium including fibroid; 11 - two RS left parametrium; 12 - one RS left parametrium; 13 - LS right fimbriae; 14 - two mid TS right fallopian tube; 15 - two RS TS right ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sigmoid fat&amp;quot;, consists of an unorientated irregular shaped piece of fat measuring 42 x 18 x 13mm.  The fat is partially covered by a pale smooth membrane, presumed peritoneum, with multiple tan nodules over this membrane ranging in size from 1 to 4mm.  The specimen is inked blue.  Blocks: 1 - two RS TS; 2 - two RS TS.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Infracolic omentum&amp;quot;, consists of an unorientated irregular shape piece of fat, 380 x up to 185mm x up to 25mm.  There are 5 indurated pale areas, the first approximately 30 x 25 x 25mm, the second 45 x 34 x 25mm, the third 40 x 15 x 16mm, the fourth 22 x 15 x 13mm and the fifth, 8 x 3 x 4mm.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - RS from different pale areas.  (TO:DT/eh 16/7/67)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Qadeer):
A.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving the left tube, including the fimbriae.  No carcinoma in situ / STIC is seen.  Serous carcinoma also involves the paradnexal soft tissues.  The ovary is essentially unremarkable.
B.  Deposits of serous carcinoma are present in the left parametrium, the paracervical soft tissue and on the surface of the right ovary.
The ectocervix and endocervix mucosa are unremarkable.  The endometrium is essentially inactive.  The myometrium shows a small leiomyoma.
C.  Several deposits of high grade serous carcinoma are present.
D.  The omentum shows extensive high grade serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma predominantly involving the omentum, sigmoid fat, left tube, left paradenexal soft tissues, left parametrium and surface of the right ovary.
