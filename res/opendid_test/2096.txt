CLINICAL:
CRC.  CLM.  Liver resection.  Falciform ligament.  Cholecystectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right liver" consists of liver 185 x 120 x 70mm, weighing 558g.  The liver capsule is unremarkable.  Within the liver are two tan nodules, 5 and 10mm across.  The nodules are at least 15mm clear of the margins.  The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - larger nodule; 4 - margin adjacent to larger nodule; 5 & 6 - smaller nodule; 7 - uninvolved liver.
B.  Specimen labelled "Falciform" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 80 x 55 x 10mm.  No focal lesions are identified.  RS in 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder" consists of a gallbladder 70 x 25 x 25mm.  The serosa is green, smoothand shiny.  The gallbladder wall is 1mm thick.  The mucosa is green and velvety.  No gallstones are present.
Blocks:  1 - cystic duct and neck; 2 - body; 3 - fundus.  (TO: EI; BC/rt 18.5.65)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr F Pacquin)
A.  Sections of liver confirm the presence of two foci of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is variably prominent mucin extravasation. The foci of carcinoma are located within the liver parenchyma.Adenocarcinoma appears clear of the resection margin (>10mm). The adjacent liver shows patchy mild chronic inflammation and macro-vesicular steatosis. The morphology of the adenocarcinoma is similar to that of the previously reported colorectal carcinoma(13K06574), and although extracellular mucin appears more prominent in the liver deposits, the overall features would be in keeping with primary colorectal origin
B.  Sections show mature fibroadipose tissue. There are no atypical features. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
C.  Sections of gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis. There is fibromuscular thickening of the gallbladder wall, focal Rokitansky Aschoff sinus formation and moderate chronic inflammation. There are no unusual features. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right liver: Metastatic adenocarcinoma, margins appear clear (see above). 

B.  Falciform ligament: No evidence of malignancy.

C.  Gallbladder:Chronic cholecystitis.
