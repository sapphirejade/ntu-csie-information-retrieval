HISTORY:  
Appx Ca.  Frozen section.  Peritoneal nodule.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEAL NODULE".  Three pieces of tissue, measuring  10, 6, 4mm.  The 6mm piece is fatty. The 10 and 4mm pieces have firm pale nodular lesions 7mm and 3mm.  FS : 1. TS offirm lesion, 2. Remainder. 
F/S : "Nodular fibrotic scar tissue.  Some atypical vacuolated cells present with scar tissue ? histiocytic. Await paraffin section for final diagnosis to exclude small signet ring cell ca component".  Discussed with Israel (fellow) by Dr. A. Janusz on 18.8.65.  
(1 FS; 2 remainder of tissue).  AE (M-2/DN/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr A. Nunno)
Histology shows pieces of fibrous scar tissue containing a foreign body giant cell reaction to suture material.  Adjacent to this there is a small focal area (2mm approximately) where there are small infiltrating trabeculae of cells which have mildly to moderately pleomorphic nuclei with scattered signet ring cells also present.  Scattered mitotic figures are seen.  Morphology is consistent with the previously documented metastatic mixed adeno-neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC-WHO 2010).  
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL NODULE - 
 - FOCALLY INVOLVED BY METASTATIC MIXED ADENO-NEUROENDOCRINE CARCINOMA.
