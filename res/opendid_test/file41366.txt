HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
GOULBURN VALLEY HEALTH - TATURA CAMPUS AND SUTHERLAND HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
G2 endometrioid adenoca.  Uterus.
1. Peritoneal washings - cyto.
2. Uterus, tubes and ovaries.
3. Right pelvic sentinel node.s
4. Left pelvic sentinel nodes.
5. Omental biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus, cervix attached tubes and ovaries weighing 154g together.

Right tube measures 70mm in length 5mm diameter. Serosa is smooth and grey.  Paratubal cyst present otherwise sectioning is unremarkable.  Right ovary measures 30x15x10mm.  Outer surface is lobulated and yellow and sectioning is unremarkable.

Left tube measures 60mm in length 7mm diameter. Serosa is smooth and grey.  Sectioning is unremarkable.  Left ovary measures 22x15x10mm.  Outer surface is grey lobulated sectioning is unremarkable.

Uterus measures 95x70x40mm.  Received open coronally.  Anterior wall measures 24mm and posterior wall 25mm.  There is a fairly ill defined creamy lesion from fundus to lower segment involving mostly anterior aspect of the specimen measuring 35mm approximately, with the depth of 12mm.  No obvious extension to the cervix present.

(1 right parametrium; 2 left parametrium; 3 right tube; 4 right ovary;  5 left tube; 6 left ovary; 7-9 one full face anterior uterus; 10-13 more section of the tumour, endometrium of anterior portion; 14-17 one full face of posterior portion; 18 more section from the ? tumour of posterior).  RS (M-18)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Two fibrofatty pieces of tissue 6 and 5mm plus two lymph nodes.  AE (2-1)

C.  &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of a lymph node 20mm, serially sliced.  AE (M-1)

D.  &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Fibrofatty tissue 30x20x5mm.  No obvious nodule identified.  AE (M-1/SM 25/3/2068 ank)

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 23/2/67
Immunostains for MSI proteins (105 HAMRUN CIRCUIT BRIDGETOWN HOSPITAL; block: A8)
MLH1: Negative (lost)
PMS2: Negative (lost)
MSH2: Positive (intact)
MSH6: Positive (intact)
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.
