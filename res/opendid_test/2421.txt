HISTORY:  
Peritonectomy - spleen, gallbladder, omentum, right hemi + anterior resection, small bowel mass, ant abdominal wall, (--illegible) resection.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "SMALL BOWEL, RIGHT COLON, SIGMOID, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, DIAPHRAGM, PERITONEAL DISEASE". Specimen consists of:
Gallbladder. Gallbladder with a staple at the cystic duct. The gallbladder is 80x40mm. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny, the wall is 2-3mm and the mucosal surface is green and granular. 
(1 cystic duct; 2 body; 3 fundus).
Spleen. It weighs 141g and is 100x70x30mm. The external surface has a number of white patches, up to 10mm and the cut surface is unremarkable. 
(4-6 representative sections).
Fat with peritoneal surface. There are numerous pieces of fatty tissue with fragmented pieces of peritoneum with an aggregate of 180x180x30mm. There is caking and puckering of the fatty tissue in a number of samples. 
(7-10 representative samples of thickened fibrofatty tissue).
Large bowel.Position of caecum, ascending colon, possibly transverse flexure within which there is a tumour. Attached to this colon are multiple loops of bowel on which there is also attached a piece of ?muscle which is 60x60mm. The caecum does not appear to have attached terminal ileum although there is a stapled resection margin. The caecum-------and transverse colon are approximately 290mm in length. The caecum is greatly dilated to 90mm in diameter and the abdominal wall is thinned 1-2mm. 110mm from a stapled margin possibly the ileocaecal valve area, there is a fungating tumour located within the bowel wall. This tumour is just above anastomosis staple margin (25mm above the anastomosis). The loops of bowel attached to the serosal surface above the tumour appears to contain a tumour which is in direct continuity with the disc of ?muscle which has been inked black. 
(11 proximal resection margin; 12 distal resection margin; 13 resection of tumour on mucosal surface; 14&15 sections of disc of ?muscle ?tumour below). 
Further loops of bowel (?large cake in tumour). The bowel is approximately 200x30mm. 
(16 bowel wall and tumour outside the wall;17 resection of caking).
Small bowel. A piece of small bowel, 70x25mm. There is firm nodular area 30mm in diameter on the serosal surface.
(18&19 small bowel).
Further piece of tissue including ?diaphragm. The pieces of ?diaphragm are with an aggregate of 90x90x20-30mm. There is a tubal structure with a tie at one end which is 45x10mm. 
(20&21 proximal LS; 22 mid TS; 23 tip, LS; 24&25 ?diaphragm). RS (M-25/Mcculloch/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Z Brott)  
Sections show metastatic poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring differentiation with evidence of focal neuroendocrine differentiaion on immunohistochemical staining involving serosa of gallbladder, cystic duct lymph node, capsule of spleen, omentum, segment of liver, and serosa, wall and submucosa of caecum and terminal ileum in the region of ileocaecal valve. Tumour also involves separately submitted peritoneal fragments and a segment of vas deferens. The terminal ileum and colonic resection margins from the right hemicolectomy specimen appear clear of tumour. Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive staining with  CEA and CDX-2 with focal staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin.  Ki-67 shows a proliferative index of 80%.
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONECTOMY: 
- DISSEMINATED POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH AREAS OF SIGNET RING DIFFERENTIATION WITH MINOR NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION.
