Peritonectomy Redo. 
- SI, colon, tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEAL TUMOUR, SMALL BOWEL + COLON". Consists of an anastomosis between two segments of probable small bowel, another segment of bowel and four pieces of soft tissue. 
There are large segments of small bowel with anastomosis, measuring 560mm in length. Close to surgical margin 1, there is side to side anastomosis with another length of small bowel, measuring 120mm inlength with circumference up to 35mm. The serosa of the bowel appears ragged with multiple adhesions. However, there are no obvious mass lesions identified on the serosa or within the lumen of the bowel. Representative sections embedded.
(1 margin one; 2 margin two; 3-7 representative sections of small bowel).
The short segment of bowel in the container is probable segmentof large bowel. It measures 45mm in length with circumference up to 40mm. Again, there are no obvious lesions within this loop of bowel. The specimen was sectioned longitudinally. Representative sections.
(8&9 representative sections of the smaller length of bowel)
There are two small pieces of fibrous tissue identified in the container. Fibrofatty tissue, measuring 35&20mm in maximal extent. On the sectioning of the large piece of tissue, there is possible deposit of tumour identified within measuring up to 15mm in maximal extent. On the sectioning of the smaller piece oftissue, it is represented by mucin filled cyst, measuring about 8mm in diameter. All small pieces of tissue were embedded.
(10&11 larger piece of tissue, representative section; 12 small piece of tissue). RS (M-12/ RQ/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. B. Moutray)       
Sections of the portion of fibrofatty tissue show deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma involving fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle. The carcinoma is characterised by lakes of mucin, many lined by moderately to marked atypical mucinous epithelium. Infiltrative architecture (both epithelium and mucin) is apparent in a number of areas. The appearances are in keeping with origin in moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix described in 2062 [17/5/2062], 07E0320190). 
Sections of the submitted segments of small andlarge bowel show scattered foci of serosal scar tissue in keeping with adhesions. No lymph nodes are identified.
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL TUMOUR, SMALL BOWEL AND LARGE BOWEL SEGMENTS 
- PERITONEAL DEPOSIT OF MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN IN PRIMARY APPENDICEAL NEOPLASM.
- SEROSAL FIBROSIS OF SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL OF SEGMENTS CONSISTENT WITH ADHESIONS.
