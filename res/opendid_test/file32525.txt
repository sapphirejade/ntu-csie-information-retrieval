Ca 125: 101 ovarian cyst.  30yo patient.  Left ovarian cyst.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left ovarian cyst&amp;quot;, consists of a cyst, received in multiple pieces, ranging from 10 to 80mm and measuring 80 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  The cyst wall is approximately 2mm thick.  Patchy haemorrhagic areas are seen.  No papillary excrescences are seen.  RS 2 blocks.
Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - frozen section; 3 to 9 - representative cyst.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right ovarian cyst&amp;quot;, consists of three fragments of flattened cyst wall tissue measuring 30 x 10 x 5mm, 22 x 15 x 8mm and 5mm in maximum dimension.  The cyst wall ranges from 1 to 3mm in maximum dimension and part of the wall has an orange appearance.  Specimen AE 3 blocks.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Endometrial curettings&amp;quot;, consists of tan curettings, 18 x 15 x 3mm in aggregate.    AE 1 block.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue, 65 x 50 x 10mm.  A mass lesion is not identified on sectioning.  RS 3 blocks.   (TO:JL/ta 18/2/66)

B.  Sections of the left ovarian cyst show an endometriotic cyst. There is a also a haemorrhagic corpus luteum-type cyst. There are no atypical features. There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.  Sections show polypoid fragments of late secretory endometrium. There is no polyp, endometritis or hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.

D.  Sections show fragments of mature fibroadipose tissue. There are no atypical features. There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left ovarian cyst: Endometriotic cyst.
