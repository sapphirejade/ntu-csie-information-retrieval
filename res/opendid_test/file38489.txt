CLINICAL NOTES:
Colorectal ca.  Peritonectomy.
Segment IV B liver lesion.
Omentectomy.
Subtotal colectomy.
Small bowel.
Peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SUBTOTAL COLECTOMY, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, ABDOMINAL WALL&amp;quot;.  Consists of multiple components in the same jar.  Portion of colon measuring 350mm in length and 25mm in diameter with attached peritoneum and abdominal wall and portion of omentum measuring 290x120x110mm.
Mucosa of the colon maintained normal appearance. No ulceration or mass present over the mucosa.  Sectioning of the colon shows severe diverticular disease.
There is an ill defined irregular white firm lesion in the peritoneum attached to the colon, measuring approximately 20x20x25mm.  No obvious invasion to the abdominal wall are present.
There is a separate mass located in left colon, peritoneum extending to the abdominal wall measuring 60x30x20mm approximately and it is 10mm clear from the surgical margin.
There is a third white firm mass measuring 40x20x20mm approximately located in the abdominal wall possibly extending to the overlying ellipse of skin.  Overlying ellipse of skin measures 25x10mm.

Small portion of small bowel 80mm in length 20mm in diameter.  Mucosa appears intact.  There are multiple black irregular foci over the serosa.
There is a gallbladder 70x45x20mm.  Serosa appears irregular and black.  Mucosa is velvety.  No tumour deposit present.  Also a small portion of fibrofatty tissue separately in the same jar 80x70x20mm.  No obvious tumour deposit present.

(1 colonic surgical margin from one end; 2 surgical margin from other end closer to the mass; 3-5 one composite section of the mass close to the colon ? anastomotic area; 6&amp;amp;7 second mass abdominal wall composite sections; 8-10 second section of the second mass composite section; 11&amp;amp;12 composite section of thrid tumour; 13 section of third tumour; 14 section of the tumour into the skin; 15 diverticular disease; 16 small bowel; 17 gallbladder; 18&amp;amp;19 section for tumour banking). RS (M-19)

B.  &amp;quot;LIVER SEGMENT IV B&amp;quot;.  Consists of a wedge of liver weighing 50g and measuring 50x70x40mm.  Surgical margin inked blue.  Serially sliced with 4mm intervals.  No obvious lesion identified.  Generally appears fatty and non cirrhotic.  Two full face embedded.

(1-3 one full face; 5&amp;amp;6 second full face). RS (6-6/SM 25/9/2069 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. V. Suozzo)
A.  Sections show two deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary, one in mesentery of the colon and the other involving abdominal wall including extension into skeletal muscle.  The rest of the colonic wall shows uncomplicated diverticular disease.  One local lymph node examined shows reactive changes.  The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion.
Sections through the small bowel segment show surface fibrous adhesions with no tumour involvement.
Sections through the gallbladder are unremarkable.
Sections through attached skin and subcutaneous tissues shows organising granulation tissue with foreign body giant cell reaction to suture material presumably related to previous surgery.

No focal colonic or small bowel mucosal abnormality is seen.

B.  Sections through the liver show moderate macrovesicular steatosis.  No focal lesion  is seen.  No bile canalicular cholestasis, alpha-1 antitrypsin globules or Mallory hyaline is seen.  Hepatocyte iron and copper content is not increased.  No fibrosis is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
SUBTOTAL COLECTOMY, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, ABDOMINAL WALL :
-TWO SEPARATE DEPOSITS OF MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING COLONIC MESENTERY AND ABDOMINAL WALL.
- SMALL BOWEL WITH SURFACE FIBROUS ADHESIONS.
- GALLBLADDER WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
LIVER SEGMENT 4B :
-FATTY CHANGE.
-NO FOCAL LESION IDENTIFIED.
