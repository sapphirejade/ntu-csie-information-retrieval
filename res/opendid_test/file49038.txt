Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma.  TLH + BSO + pelvic washings and omental biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, both tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 70g in total.  The specimen is received opened in the sagittal plane from the posterior aspect.  The uterus measures 73 x 30 x 23mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 23mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 24 x 13 x 9mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 39mm with a maximum diameter of 4mm.  The right ovary measures 23 x 12 x 9mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  There is an intramural fibroid on the left side measuring up to 8mm.  There is an endometrial tumour which measures approximately 25 x 20mm in both the anterior and posterior body.  The tumour appears to invade into the myometrium at least 50%.
Block 1-3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4-9 - RS left anterior endomyometrium and cervix (9 - with fibroid); 10 &amp;amp; 11 - RS anterior right endomyometrium and cervix; 12-14 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - RS right superior posterior endomyometrium; 17 - LS right fimbriae; 18 - 2TS right fallopian tube; 19- 2TS right ovary; 20 - LS left fimbriae; 21 - 2TS left fallopian tube; 22 - 2TS left ovary.  Please refer to blocking diagram.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of fat 50 x 40 x 20mm.
Blocks 1-3 - RS.  (TO:NM/ec 24/10/67)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Leet):
A.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 12mm through a wall 14mm thick.  A moderate amount of lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
The remaining myometrium shows adenomyosis.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
Stains for MSI are pending.

B.  The omentum is uninvolved and unremarkable.


DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 12mm through a wall 14mm thick.  Lymphvascular invasion is present.  The cervix and the omentum are uninvolved.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 1/10/66:
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed. MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
