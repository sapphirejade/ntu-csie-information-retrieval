FINDINGS / LESION:  There is a well demarcated stellated lesion noted in slices 3 to 5.  It measures 12mm superior to inferior x 15mm medial to lateral x 15mm anterior to posterior.  It is approximately 10 to 15mm from superior margin, approximately 24mm from inferior margin, less than 1mm from anterior, 10mm from posterior, 10mm from superior and 10mm from inferior.  Remainder of the breast tissue is predominantly fatty.
