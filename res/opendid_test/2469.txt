HISTORY:  
CRC. Omentectomy, right hemicolectomy, sigmoid colectomy, small bowel resection. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
"HARTMANN'S, OMENTUM, RIGHT COLON". Received multiple tissue fragments all of which appears to be involved with a disseminated deposits on their serosal surfaces. The tissue fragments are; 
- Three segments of small bowel 65x25mm, 100x45mm and 260x60mm. The smaller fragment has multiple serosal deposits over an area of 30x12mm involving the wall and mesentery but not involving the mucosa or the longitudinal margins. The medium segment has a pieceof fibrofatty tissue attached towards one end measuring 30x25x10mm with multiple firm white tumour nodules on the cut surface. Multiple white mesenteric nodules are identified. The mucosal surface and resection margins appear unremarkable. The longest segment has multiple adhesions surrounding a  nodule around which two bowel loops are adherent to each other. This area of adhesion is located 95 mm of the nearest resection margin. Multiple serosal nodules and mesenteric nodules are identified.
(1&2 small bowel shortest segment [1 TS each resection margin, 2 serosal nodules]; 3-5 medium segment [3 each resection margin LS, 4&5 nodules]; 6-8 longest smallbowel segment [6 LS each resection margin, 7 area of adherent bowel loops, 8 serosal nodule]). 
- A right hemicolectomy specimen including terminal ileum, 75x25mm, caecum and ascending colon 75x80mm, appendix 70x10mm. Attachedis a segment of small bowel with adherent pieces of skeletal muscle measuring 40x35x25mm , (presumed part of the abdominal wall). The small bowel measures 280x40mm. It is adherent to the mesentery andmesocolon of terminal ileum/caecum with multiple adhesions and thick fibrous exudate. The appendix outer and cut surface reveals possible involvement of the appendix with firm white nodules. The cut surface of the skeletal muscle revealsa hard white nodule extending from the outer surface of the skeletal muscle (?resection margin) to reach the wall of  the attached small bowel with no definite mucosal involvement. 
(9 terminal ileum resection margin; 10 caecum resection margin; 11 appendix TS Base LS tip; 12 appendix LS and TS tip; 13 caecum with caecum serosal node; 14 two LS resection margin of attached bowel segment; 15 attached small bowel segment with caecum mesentery nodule ; 16-19 continuous piece skeletal muscle in relation to attached small bowel segment; 20 four lymph nodes).
- A segment of large bowel (left colon)  of a total length of 150mm and up to 25mm in maximumdiameter.  The serosal surface is extensively ragged with multiple serosal nodules along the attached mesocolon. There is an area of tethered serosa located 80mm from one margin and 95mm from the other margin. The cut surface of this area reveals a mucinous tumour that is involving the full thickness of the bowel wall with probably mucosal ulceration (?primary site) in a circumferential manner and involving the underlying fat tissue extensively. This tumour measures 25 mm in maximum diameter. 
(21 LS of each resection margin; 22&23 full face areaof circumferential tumour involvement; 24&25 continuous piece serosal involvement in relation to bowel wall; 26 two lymph nodes). 
- A stoma measuring 45x40mm with two associated loops ofbowel measuring 180 mm and 105mm. The underlying fatty tissue includes pieces of skeletal muscle (part of the abdominal wall) measuring 32x25x25mm. The cut surface of this skeletal muscle reveals a tumour with hard white cut surface extending to reach the wall of  the adjacent bowel segment. Multiple isolated tumour deposits are noted along the associated mesentery. 
(27 LS shorter length resection margin; 28 LS longer length resection margin; 29-31 continuouspiece stomal opening; 32&33 continuous piece skeletal muscle tumour with attached bowel).
- Attached multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue representing omentum measuring 250x150x50mm. Diffuse areas of involvement by firm and hard white nodules are identified along the serosal surface and confirmed on cut surface.
(34&35 representative samples, 36-43 multiple further blocks of nodes and sigmoid tumour). RS (M-43/ZH/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr O Sabat)
Histology shows a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with apparent origin within presumed sigmoid colon where there is an area of mucosal dysplasia consistent with pre-existing adenoma. Mucinous adenocarcinoma extends through the muscularis propria focally reaching the serosal surface with extensive and widespread deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma over the serosal surface of small bowel, left colon, within the appendix, mesentery, and within fibrous scar tissueat the anastomosis between the small bowel and skin of the stoma. Some fibrous fascial tissue (presumed anterior abdominal wall) is also infiltrated by metastatic adenocarcinoma which stops short of reaching adjacent skeletal muscle. Six of 22 nodes contain deposits of metastatic carcinoma, several of whichare well-circumscribed deposits of mucinous adenocarcinoma presumed to be entirely replaced lymph nodes for staging purposes.
