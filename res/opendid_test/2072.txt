HISTORY:  
Re-do peritonectomy.  Previous peritonectomy for colon cancer.  Peritoneal nodules, ovaries, redo right hemicolectomy, pelvic peritonectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
'RIGHT COLON (RIGHT R + LOVARIES)'.  
Right hemicolectomy:  A portion of bowel measuring up to 80mm in length with a ?healed anastomosis located 20mm from one resection margin and 45mm from the opposing resection margin.  The external surface is haemorrhagicwith some ragged area ?adhesions ?tumour.  There is mesentery attached.  On opening, the mucosa is unremarkable.  (1and2 LS resection margins; 3 representative anastomosis; 4-6 representative serosal surface with ?adhesions ?tumour deposit; 7 three possible mesenteric nodes; 8 four possible mesenteric nodes;
Fallopian tube and ovary:  A fallopian tube measuring up to 40mm in length and 12mm in diameter with fimbrial end.  There is an attached mass measuring up to 40x30x25mm.  It weighs in total 24g.  On sectioning, the ?ovary ?tumour mass is gelatinous and lobulated.  No definite ovary identified. 9and10 paired representative mass/ovary; 11 further representative mass/ovary [tumour reserve block]; 12 LS fimbrial ends;
Peritoneum and peritoneal nodules:  A piece of peritoneum measuring up to 70x60x15mm with nodules measuring in aggregate 20x20x15mm.  There is a possible fallopian tube attached measuring up to 45mm in length and 7mm in maximum external diameter.  There is a mass ?ovary ?tumour deposit 20x15x10mm.  
13 peritoneal nodules; 14and15 fimbrial end tube; 16 representative peritoneum; 17 possible ovary).  RS (M-17/ED/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  
There are tumour deposits involving one fallopian tube and an adjacent tumour mass in fibromuscular connective tissue.  A separate fallopian tube is identified.  No normal ovary tissue is identified (ovaries previous removed procedure 21/8/2063 ALLTEL Corporation 10O63588).  There are separate tumour deposits in peritoneal tissue.  
In each case, the tumour deposits are of similar appearance toprevious peritonectomy specimen and consist of metastatic high grade (moderate to poorly differentiated) mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The tumour deposits are invasive and contain neoplastic epithelium which shows high nuclear grade, with moderate mitotic activity and numerous apoptoses.  Some signet ring like cells are present but these appear degenerate related to tumournecrosis and a definite signet ring cell carcinoma component is not seen. Sections of the right hemicolon show unremarkable small bowel and large bowel tissue with some surface fibrous adhesions.  Six sampled mesocolic lymph nodes are negative for tumour.
DIAGNOSIS:  
RIGHT COLON AND OTHER TISSUE - 
- Peritoneal deposits of metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma, similar appearance toprevious, involving peritoneal tissue, and tissue adjacent to one fallopian tube.
