HISTORY:  
Hx of colon cancer.Peritonectomy + HIPEC.  Cholecystectomy, liver resection + bilateral oophorectomy.  
Right and left ovaries, gallbladder, omentum, liver segment 6
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "BILATERAL OVARIES, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM".  Two ovaries.  The larger ovary measures 80x65x50mm.  The serosal surface is grey and smooth.  No fallopian tube is identified.  The cut surface reveals solid and cystic areas.  The solid areas are tan and yellow and the cystic areas contain yellow gelatinous fluid.  The smaller ovary measures 45x30x30mm and contains a fallopian tube with fimbrial end.  The fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and up to 5mm in diameter.  There is an associated parafimbrial cyst.  The serosal surface of the ovary is unremarkable and cut sectioning of the ovary reveals tan, solid tissue.
Also in the specimen jar is an intact gallbladder measuring 70mm in length and up to 25mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is grey and smooth.  The gallbladder was opened.  It was filled with bile, no stones identified.The wall measures 2mm thick and the mucosal surface is green and velvety.  No lesions identified.
There are also multiple pieces of omentum in aggregate measuring 300x200x80mm.  No lesions were identified within the omentum.
(1-3 from the larger ovary; 4&5 smaller ovary's attached fallopian tube [all fimbrial end submitted]; 6&7 small ovary; 8&9 gallbladder [8 TS from cystic duct and body, 9 LS from the fundus]; 10-15 omentum).  RS (M-15).
B.  "LIVER TOP SEGMENT 6".  A segment of liver measuring 35x35x30mm and weighing 20g.  On the capsular surface, there is a tan nodule which does not appear to reach the capsule.  The nodule measures 15x15mm.  The specimen was cut into transverse pieces and the nodule corresponds with a firm tan lesion within the liver measuring up to 20mm.  This lesion is 1mm from the resection margin
(1-4 sections from the tumour and closest resection margin).  RS (M-4/PL/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (T. Halburnt)
A.  Sections through both ovaries show metastatic adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary.  No surface capsular deposits are seen.  Sections through the fallopian tube attached to the smaller ovarian mass show a simple parafimbrial cyst and otherwise no significant abnormality. The gallbladder is unremarkable.  Sections through the omentum show a reactive lymph node with no evidence of tumour.  
B.  Sections show extensively necrotic metastatic adenocarcinoma in keeping with colorectal primary involving liver parenchyma. The adjacent liver shows mild perivenular macrovesicular steatosis and otherwise no intrinsic abnormality.  Local excision of the deposit of adenocarcinoma appears complete.
DIAGNOSIS:  
BILATERAL OVARIES, GALLBLADDER AND OMENTUM :
-METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING BOTH OVARIES.  UNREMARKABLEGALLBLADDER AND OMENTUM.
LIVER SEGMENT 6 :
-METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA.
