PRO Marlene Barton CHAMBLEY
Distribution:   FILE-COPY
HISTORY:
Peritonectomy, positive gastrectomy etc, for recurrent PMP. SILN LUQ nodule, LNSI.
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "VAGINAL VAULT FOR F/S". Two irregular pieces of fibrous tissue 20x20x15mm and 15mm in diameter. One section centre of each piece. 
F/S: "Fibromuscular tissue with smooth muscle and vessels. Deeper sections show some ------- ?endocervical epithelium at one side. Possible residual endocervical stump tissue. D/D leiomyoma/smooth muscle hyperplasia, tumour not seen". Reported by Dr B Osmanski. 
(1 frozen; 2 sections from smaller pieces of tissue; 3-6 sections from larger piece of tissue). AE (M-6).
B. "PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE". Seven pieces oftissue. Five are pieces of fatty tissue which are 10mm, 10mm, 10mm, 30mm and 50mm respectively. Some of these pieces of fatty tissue have small solid areas. The other two pieces of tissue consist of small bowel and partial gastrectomy. The piece of small bowel is stapled at both ends and is 40x35mm. Within the wall there is a solid lesion which is 17mm in diameter. This is clear of the resection margins and does not appear to involve the mucosal surface. The partial gastrectomy specimen is roughly rectangular in shape being 40x45x25mm. There is a staple line down one side, (please see diagram). There is a full thickness lactogenic perforation 20mm in diameter. Above the full thickness perforation thereis a soft white mucinous lesion 18mm in diameter apparently attached to the external surface of the stomach wall. No tumour perforation is seen. 
(1&2 sections of fatty tissue representative; 3-5 small bowel [3&4 LS showing both resection margins, 5 TS]; 6-10 sections of partial gastrectomy showing mucinous lesion in 6,7&8 and ?normal stomach in 9 and 10). RS (M-10).
C. "LYMPH NODE OF ILEOSTOMY MESENTERY". A piece of white nodule 8x5x3mm. AE (1-1).
D. "PROXIMAL SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY". Soft piece of fatty tissue 15x10x2mm, which is slightly firm in an area of 5mm in diameter. AE (1-1/Daire/ht).
E. "LEFT UPPER QUADRANT NODULE". A piece of tan tissue which is 20x20x10mm and which has a solid tan cut surface. AE (M-2/Nwankwo/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr B Tarangelo)
A. Sections show fibromuscular stroma with marked diathermy artefact and some areas showing surface squamous mucosa as well as endocervical-type columnar mucosa and some underlying endocervical-type glands. No tumour is identified. There is no atypia of the squamous or endocervical columnar epithelium. 
B. Sections of the fatty tissue show several deposits of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma comprising deposits of extracellular mucin with associated strips of mucin secreting epithelium with intermediate grade nuclear features. A desmoplastic stroma response is seen to some of the deposits. 
Small intestine: Sections of the smallintestine show multiple deposits of mucinous adenocarcinoma involving the submucosa, muscularis propria and serosa. There are focal changes suspicious for lymphatic permeation. Mucinous adenocarcinoma involves both resection margins of the small intestine, and in one of the blocks from one resection margin (Block 4), there is full thickness involvement of the small intestinal wall, including ulceration of the overlying mucosa. 
Partial gastrectomy: Sections of the partial gastrectomy show mucinous adenocarcinoma involving the muscularis propria and serosa including the serosal surface. Focal perineural invasion is seen. Also, there are other deposits of mucinous adenocarcinoma within the specimen, involving serosa, muscularis propria, and showing focal extension into submucosa. 
C. The single lymph node shows no involvement.
D. Sections show fatty tissuecontaining two small lymph nodes, which show no involvement. 
E. Sections show a splenunculus. There is no tumour involvement.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A. VAGINAL VAULT:
- SQUAMOUS AND ENDOCERVICAL MUCOSA WITH UNDERLYING FIBROMUSCULAR STROMA.
B. PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- WELL-DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING PERITONEUM, SMALL INTESTINE AND THE PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY SPECIMEN. FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE TEXT.
C. LYMPH NODE OF ILEOSTOMY MESENTERY:
- THE SINGLE LYMPHNODE SHOWS MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
D. PROXIMAL SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY:
- TWO SMALL LYMPH NODES SHOW  MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY. 
E. LEFT UPPER QUADRANT NODULE:
- SPLENUNCULUS .
