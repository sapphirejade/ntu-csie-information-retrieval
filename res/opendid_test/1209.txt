CLINICAL:
Right fallopian tube and ovary.  Bilateral ovarian cancer.  Left tube and ovary frozen section.  Incidental finding of bilateral ovarian masseson renal ultrasound.  Ca 125=50.  Abdominal hysterectomy.  Appendicectomy.  Ischaemic heart disease.   Renal impairment.  Epilepsy.  Smoker.  Obesity.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a multiloculated cystic ovary measuring 125 x 70 x 60mm with overlying fallopian tube 45mm in length.  Approximately 1/3rd of the external surface is covered by tan papillary excrescences.  The remainder of the external surface is smooth.  The internal surfaces of the cystic spaces are mainly smooth with a 40mm area covered by excrescences.  The cyst contains serous fluid.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - RS for frozen section; 3 - fallopian tube; 4 & 5 - cyst with overlying fallopian tube; 6 to 9 - cyst with external surface excrescences; 10 & 11 - cyst with internal surface excrescences spanning 40mm area with no external excrescences; 12 - central portion of cyst. 
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary" consists of a solid cystic mass measuring 60 x 35 x 35mm.  A possible fallopian tube 20mm in length is identified.  Approximately half ofthe external surface is covered by papillary excrescences.  The mass contains multiloculated cystic cavities containing serous fluid.  The internal surfaces of the cyst wall appear smooth.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - RS frozen section; 3 - possible fallopian tube; 4 to 7 - areas with external excrescences; 8 - area with smooth external surface.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
A & B.  Benign vs low grade border line serous cyst adenoma, favour low grade borderline.  
Result to Dr Jessie by Dr Y Margulies/Y Heubusch/Y Juarez at 14:20 on 16/06/64.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a sheet of greater omentum measuring 195 x 150 x 15mm.  No focal nodularity is identified.  RS 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr YMargarito): 
A and B. Sections show bilateral borderline serous cystadenoma with low grade dysplasia of the ovaries. The lesion is composed of cysts and papillae lined by columnar tumour cells with serous differentiation. Tufting, nuclear stratification and mild nuclear atypia are seen, in keeping with low grade dysplasia. The lesion involves the surfaces of both ovaries. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
The fallopian tubes show no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show omental fat with no evidence of malignancy.
Shown to Dr FERNANDO Bisbee.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to B. Left and right fallopian tubes and ovaries:
- Bilateral borderline serous cystadenoma with low grade dysplasia of the ovaries
- Tumour involves surfaces of both ovaries
C. Omentum: no evidence of malignancy
