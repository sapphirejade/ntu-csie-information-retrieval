CLINICAL:
Distal oesophageal adenoCa.
1.  Distal oesophagus.
2.  Hilar lymph nodes.
Anaemia, oesophageal carcinoma, HTN, GORD.
Additional information obtained:  Pre-op chemoradiation given.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Distal oesophagus" consists of a distal oesophagus with attached stomach.  The oesophagus measures 55mm in length x 55mm in open diameter.  The attached stomach measures 55 x 40 x 35mm.  The serosal surface appears unremarkable.  There is attached adipose tissue to the lesser curve measuring 50 x 40 x 20mm.  On opening the oesophagus has a mottled appearance with alternating white squamous areas with roughened pink areas.  At the junction of the distal oesophagus and stomach there is a firm area measuring 20 x 10mm.  This area appears limited to the stomach mucosa.  This area is 45mm from the proximal oesophageal surgical margin (inked blue) and approximately 38mm from the distal stomachsurgical margin (inked black).  The gastric mucosa appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 6 - LS of proximal surgical margin; 7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 to 13, 14 to 16, 17 to 19, 20 to 22, 23 to 25, 26 to 29, 30 to 32 - oesophagus AE from proximal to distal including firm area; 33 - two LS of distal gastric margin; 34 to 40 - lymph nodes as seen.
B.  Specimen labelled "Hilar lymph node" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 8 and 10mm.  One piece contains a lymph node 6mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph node is bisected.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Proximal donut" consists of a donut of mucosa measuring 15 x 12mm to a length of 6mm.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a donut of mucosa measuring 13 x 13 to a length of 3mm.AE 1 block.  (JM/rt 9.3.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Cubias & registrar Dr K Shurtliff):
A.  Sections show several foci of residual intramucosal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising on a background of extensive Barrett's mucosa with low and focal high grade dysplasia.  The foci of intramucosal adenocarcinoma range from 0.5mm to 3mm across, and consist of back-to-back glands lined by cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  Some glands contain intraluminal necrosis.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  No submucosal invasion is seen.    
Both dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma are at least 10mm clear of the proximal, distal and radial oesophageal margins.  
Changes consistent with treatment effect are present, including extensive ulceration, acellular pools of mucin in the submucosa and occasionalatypical stromal cells.  There is a grade 1 (moderate) response to preoperative chemoradiation with residual small groups of cancer cellspresent.
The gastric mucosa shows no significant abnormality.  The eight (8) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.
B.  Section shows one lymph node withno evidence of malignancy (0/1).
C.  Section shows a donut lined by normal squamous epithelium.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Section shows a donut lined by acid secreting gastric mucosa.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Distal oesophagus:  
-  Intramucosal adenocarcinoma arising in dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus.
-  Margins clear.
-  Eight negative lymph nodes
-  ypT1a pN0 MX
B.  Hilar lymph node:  One negative lymph node
C.  Proximal donut:  No significant abnormality.
D.  Distal donut:  No significant abnormality.
