CLINICAL NOTES:
L breast sentinel node frozen section.
L breast ca long-lateral, medium-medial, short-superior.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;LEFT BREAST SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Consists of 40mm of fat. 5mm lymph node maximum dimension and 20mm lymph node. The 5mm is bisected, half for frozen section. 20mm lymph node is sectioned into transverse section, one section for frozen section.

FS x 1 (1 section of each lymph node), remainder of 5mm lymph node block 2, 20mm lymph node block 3.

F/S : &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;. Reported to Dr. Santarpia by Dr. L. Wilt on 20.04.2070 at 12;45 pm. Representative sections. (M-3)

MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral
Number of slices: 14
FINDINGS / LESION:  There is a well demarcated tumour with a pale white appearance noted in slices 5-11. It measures 25mm medial to lateral x 23mm superior to inferior x 29mm anterior to posterior. It is 20mm from medial margin, 15mm from lateral margin, 5mm from anterior, 5mm from posterior, 5mm from superior and 12mm from inferior margin. Remainder of the breast is predominantly fatty. Representative sections are taken.
(1&amp;amp;2 LS through medial margin slice 1; 3&amp;amp;4 slice 2; 5-8 full face section slice 6; 9&amp;amp;10 mid section slice 7; 11&amp;amp;12 mid section slice 8; 13&amp;amp;14 mid section slice 9 [9 and 11 includes superior margin]; 15-17 LS through lateral margin slice 14). Representative sections. (M-17/MC 21/4/2071 ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. L Graeff)
A. One of two sentinel lymph nodes shows a 3mm metastasis on the paraffin section. This is within the remaining lymph node tissue from the larger lymph node, which was not examined at the time of frozen section. There is no extranodal spread.
