HISTORY:  
Peritonectomy. Right pelvic peritoneum, omentum.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A."RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA". Received two fragments of fibrofatty tissue, largest measuring 140x100x9mm with focal fibrosis. On sectioning there is a 10mm yellow nodule. No mucin or tumour deposits are seen.  
(1-4 larger fragment; 5&6 each two TS smaller fragment).  RS (M-6)
B.  "OMENTUM, RIGHT PERITONEAL STRIPS".  Received multiple fragments of fibrofatty tissue, largest two appearto be segments of omentum measuring 340x150x25mm and 290x140x20mm.  The smaller fragments measuring 220x160x20mm in aggregate, some of which has a smooth and glistening surface (? peritoneum). The cutsurface reveals a possible white firm possible vascular structure measuring 18x4x4mm.  One piece of tissue measuring 20x15x6mm has a yellow firm nodular area measuring 6x6x6mm.  The remainder cut surface is fatty and unremarkable  with no discrete nodules.  
(1-5 larger piece of omentum; 6-8 smaller piece of omentum; 9 hard nodular area ; 10&11 ?vessel with peritoneal covered fatty tissue]; 12 representative other fragments).  RS (M-12/UI/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr K Skye)
A.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with foci of fibrosis with an occasional small foreign body giant cell reaction to some foreign material with a focus of fat necrosis also present.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  No free mucin is present.
B.  Histology shows fatty omental tissue with occasional small focus of fat necrosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.  No free mucin is present.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
B.  OMENTUM, RIGHT PERITONEAL STRIPS - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
