CLINICAL:
Right mastectomy for central breast cancer - sentinel node - ?positive - frozen section.  Right mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and level 1 axillary dissection (node showed tumour cells <0.2mm on frozensection).
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel, right breast (F.S)" consists of a lymph node 20mm across.  Imprints performed.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph node.  AE
IMPRINTS CYTOLOGY REPORT
Two clusters of malignant cells <0.2mm insize.
Result to surgical registrar by Dr Garfield Gilmore at 1:30pm on 04.03.2065.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast, stitch superior" consists of a mastectomy measuring 230 x 210 x 100mm.  There is an ellipse of skin on the superficial surface measuring 275 x 140mm containing a nipple areola complex.  The nipple is retracted, but the skin appears unremarkable.  There is a marking stitch on the ellipse of skin marking superior.  The superficial surface is inked blue and the deep black.  On sectioning there is a central tumour (Tumour 1) deep to the nipple containing a firm stellate tan tumour measuring approximately 70 x 40 x 40mm.  The margins for Tumour 1 are as follows:  45mm superior, 25mm inferior, 45mm deep, 5mm superficial, 50mm medial and approximately 80mm lateral.  There are three satellite masses consisting of firm nodular tan lesions measuring approximately 25 x 15 x 20 inferiorly (Tumour 2), 30 x 30x 13mm laterally (Tumour 3), 15 x 10 x 10mm medially (Tumour 4).  The margins for Tumour 2 are: 30mm superficial, 65mm inferior, 30mm deep, 130mm superior, 120mm lateral and 80mm medial.  The margins for Tumour 3 are: 15mm superficial, 50mm inferior, 30mm deep, 85mm superior, 30mm lateral and 240mm medial.  The margins for Tumour 4 are:  100mm superior, 30mm deep, 130mm inferior, 40mm superficial, 30mm medial and 250mm lateral.
Blocks:  1 - nipple-areola complex; 2 - tissue deep to nipple; 3 to 8 - Tumour 1 (3 to 5 - composite blocks: tumour and closest deep margin; 6 & 7 - composite blocks tumour and closest superficial margin; 8 - tumour); 9 & 10 - Tumour 2 (9 - Closest superficial margin; 10 - Tumour); 11 to 13 -  Tumour 3 (11 - closest superficial margin; 12 & 13 - tumour); 14 to 16 - Tumour 4 (14 & 15 - paired blocks, closest superficial margin;16 - tumour); 17 & 18 - upper inner quadrant; 19 & 20 - upper outer quadrant; 21 & 22 - lower outer quadrant; 23 & 24 - lower inner quadrant.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right axillary lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 90 x 50 x 30mm.  Lymph nodes are seen ranging from 25 to 5mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - largest lymph node serially sectioned; 2 & 3 - lymph nodes as seen.
(FG/rt 5.3.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Rabadan & registrar Dr L Murphey):
A - C.  Sections of the right breast show at least thirteen foci of invasive lobular carcinoma.   The features are as follows:  
Invasive carcinoma:
Site:   Right breast.  Main tumour is central (retroareolar). The remaining tumours involve all four quadrants.  
Type:   Multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma.  
Invasive tumour size:  Main tumour (central) 70mm, remaining tumours range from 1mm to 30mm distributed over an area of approximately 190mm.  
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson):  2
Tubules:   3   Nuclei:   1   Mitoses:   3   Mitotic rate:   19/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion:  Present.
	    
DCIS component:  
DCIS:  Not identified.  
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component:  Clear of all margins.  The closest margin (superficial) is 5mm clear (block B22).  All other margins at least 10mm clear.  
Receptors (Block B8):
Performed on main tumour.  
ER:  Positive.  
	95% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining:  Strong.
PR:  Positive.
	1% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining:  Weak.
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7):  Negative (score 0)
HER2 SISH:  Performed at Continental Airlines, WEST WIMMERA HEALTH SERVICE - JEPARIT Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 index:  Approximately 30% 
Nipple:  No significant abnormality.
