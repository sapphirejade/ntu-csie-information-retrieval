CLINICAL NOTES:
Intra op peritonectomy, liver biopsy frozen section.  CRC, gallbladder, sigmoid colon, right colon, small intestine, omentum, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;LIVER BIOPSY&amp;quot;.  Liver with surface capsule 15x7mm, 2mm thick, 4mm pale capsular lesion bisected and half embedded for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Benign bile duct hamartoma/Von Meyenburg complex&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned to Liver Fellow at 12:32pm on 23/01/2067.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder specimen serially sliced).  AE (M-2).

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL, LARGE BOWEL, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES&amp;quot;.  Received in one specimen jar, multiple tissue fragments including,

A re-do hemicolectomy specimen consists of an extended segment of small bowel, 240mm attached to a segment of large bowel 85x35mm.  Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 70mm.  An anastomosis line with hyperemic mucosa is identified.  There is an adherent strip of peritoneum measuring 115x50mm adherent to the wall of the small bowel and has multiple serosal haemorrhagic white deposits.  There is a focal stricture around a white deposit 20x20mm  arising from the serosal surface and invades small bowel wall to reach the mucosa. This area is located 80mm of the proximal resection margin.

(1  proximal and distal resection margin; 2  anastomosis; 3&amp;amp;4  serosal deposit into small bowel wall; 5  peritoneal involvement; 6  ?four lymph nodes).

An en-bloc specimen consists of an anterior resection with peritonealized sigmoid and upper rectum 260mm in length and up to 45mm in diameter with mesocolon along the specimen to a maximum width of 60mm.  Attached to uterus 75x40x30mm with right fallopian tube 30x7mm, right ovary 18x13x5mm, an intact left fallopian tube 30x7mm attached to a grossly enlarged left ovarian mass 110x95x90mm with smooth nodular outer surface. The cut surface reveals a solid white and partially cystic tumor with central areas of necrosis. The mass is adherent to the bowel mucosa, but no definite mucosal involvement. It pushes the uterine serosa and focally involves the myometrium. Away from the left adnexal mass the serosal surfaces are involved by haemorrhagic minute white deposits including the serosa of  uterus, right ovary , mesocolon and the attached peritoneal strips.  The anterior uterine surgical margin is inked blue.

(7  proximal margin; 8  distal margin; 9  tumour with bowel serosa; 10  right fallopian tube fimbrial end, two LS and one TS; 11-13  right ovary all embedded; 14  left fimbrial end; 15  left tube with underlying ovarian tumour; 16&amp;amp;17  anterior uterus {cervix to body}; 18-20  LS posterior uterus { cervix to body}; 21&amp;amp;22  continuous fundus anterior to posterior; 23  further tumour invading fundus; 24  tumour with overlying serosal involvement also tumour block for tissue banking; 25  cystic areas of tumour; 26  ?five lymph nodes).

A gallbladder 115x40mm.  The outer surface is hard and haemorrhagic across the specimen.  The wall is heavily calcified and up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces are denuded and replaced by yellow flakes with focal areas of haemorrhage at the fundus.  A yellow calculus is totally obstructing the neck measuring 14x10x10mm.  The lumen is filled with soft yellow material.

(27  cystic duct and TS neck; 28  TS body and LS fundus [decal]).

A fibrofatty piece of tissue, omentum, measuring 300x140x40mm in aggregate.  Scattered haemorrhagic minute areas are identified across the specimen.

(29&amp;amp;30  haemorrhagic area of omentum).

Received a fibrofatty piece of tissue covered with peritoneum measuring 50x30x15mm with a serosal nodule 8mm in maximum diameter.

(31  serosal nodule).

Received unorientated piece of mucosa 30x20mm with underlying tissue with overlying serosa up to 25mm.  There is a serosal nodule invading through the wall of the mucosa to approach the serosal surface.

(32  TS across the specimen).  RS (M-32).

C.  &amp;quot;PORTOCAVAL LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  One lymph node 16x12x5mm.  Serially sliced.  AE (M-1/ZH 24/2/2067 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. J. Sudol)
A.  The liver tissue shows a subcapsular benign bile duct hamartoma.  There is no malignancy.

B.  The small bowel shows a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the serosa with an exuberant desmoplastic response.  Tumour glands invade up into the mucosa.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is also present in the left ovary (as an expansile tumour mass), the right ovarian ligament, the omental fat and the peritoneal fragment.

The right ovary otherwise shows a benign adenofibroma.  Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The uterine ectocervix is mostly denuded and the endocervix is unremarkable. The endometrium shows cystic atrophy.  The myometrium shows a benign leiomyoma. The fundus of the myometrium shows inflammatory adhesion to the tumour of the left ovary, however the tumour glands in the left ovary do not invade into the myometrial muscle.

The gallbladder shows chronic cholecystitis.  A total of nine lymph nodes are present, with no malignancy.

C.  The lymph node shows lipogranulomas with no malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  LIVER BIOPSY:
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
B.  SMALL BOWEL, LARGE BOWEL, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES:
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA PRESENT IN THE SMALL BOWEL SEROSA, LEFT OVARY, RIGHT OVARIAN LIGAMENT, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM.
- CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS AND CHOLELITHIASIS.
- NINE LYMPH NODES WITH NO MALIGNANCY.
C.  PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE:
- ONE LYMPH NODE WITH NO MALIGNANCY.
