 CLINICAL:
E/O right breast DCIS.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast lesion suture long lateral, medium medial, short superior" consists of breast tissue with three sutures as mentioned above weighing 77g and measuring 70mm (medial to lateral) x 70mm (superior to inferior) x 30mm (superficial to deep).  A hookwire is inserted from the lateral aspect of the specimen.  On x-ray a cluster of microcalcifications is noted at the outer tip.  Superior margin inked red, superficial blue, deep black.  Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into twelve slices.  Slice one lateral, slice twelve medial.  The cut surfaces show fatty breast tissue.  No mass lesion is identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - LS slice one (lateral margin); 4& 5 - slice two; 6 to 8 - slice three; 9 to 12 - slice four; 13 to 16 - slice five; 17 to 20 - slice six; 21 to 24 - slice seven; 25 to 28 - slice eight; 29 to 34 - slice nine; 35 to 38 - slice ten; 39 to 41 - slice eleven; 42 & 43 - slice twelve.   AE.  (JS/ta 24/3/64) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Piccone): 
Sections show breast tissue with a 50mm diameter area of intermediate grade DCIS.No invasive carcinoma is seen.  DCIS extends very close to superior and superficial excision margins.  Other margins are free of involvement.  A synoptic report follows: 
Maximum extent of DCIS:  50mm
Nuclear grade:  Intermediate
Architecture:  Cribriform, solid
Necrosis:  Yes
Calcification:  Present
Excision Margins:  
Medial > 10mm, lateral > 10mm, inferior > 10mm, superior 1mm (block 39),
superficial 0.1mm (blocks 26,30), deep 4mm (block 18).
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast:  Intermediate grade DCIS.
