CLINICAL NOTES:
Colon ca with liver and peritoneal disease, right hepatectomy + segment 4A, re-do right hemicolectomy, bilateral ovaries.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT LIVER, SEGMENT 4A LIVER, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, BILATERAL OVARIES&amp;quot;.  Received within one specimen jar multiple tissue fragments including,

A re-do right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of segment of small bowel 180x25mm attached segment of large bowel 75x45mm.  Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 65mm.  Omentum is adherent and up to 70mm.  Extensive adhesions are identified on the overlying serosa.  Focally haemorrhagic areas are identified on the mesentery with mucinous cut surface (?fat necrosis)are identified over the caecal serosa. .  The mucosa is unremarkable.  No intralumilal tumors or polyp are seen.

(1  proximal, distal and resection margins; 2  anastomosis; 3  serosal involvement by ?fat necrosis; 4  serosal adhesions; 5  ?six lymph nodes).

A right hepatectomy specimen 561g, measuring 175x100x50mm.  The resection margin is inked blue.  The liver is serially sliced into 5 mm slices from lateral to medial.  Four well circumscribed lesions with yellow and fibrotic cut surfacelesions are identified. Described from lateral to medial:
Lesion 1, subcapsular; 6x3x3mm ,  in segment VI/V, well clear of margin more than 25mm.
Leison 2,  parenchymal, 6x6x5mm, in segment V,  located 15 mm from nearest capsule and 23mm of margin.
Lesion 3, parenchymal, 5x5x4mm, in segment V, located 13mm of the capsule more than  25mm of the margin.
Lesion 4 , the largest lesion, mid specimen (segment VIII) measuring 16x12x10mm and located 5mm of nearest resection margin.  The remainder liver parenchyma is unremarkable.

(6  lesion 1; 7  lesion 2; 8  lesion 3; 9&amp;amp;10  representative lesion for largest[lesion 4] ; 11  uninvolved liver).

A segmental liver resection (segment IVa as per clinical notes) , 9g, consists of a capsule 30x25mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 27mm.  The margin is inked blue.  The cut surface reveals a lesion 9x7x5mm involving the margin macroscopically.  It has white and yellow cut surface.

(12-14  lesion with resection margin).

A gallbladder 75x15mm.  The outer surface is smooth and glistening.  The wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces are green and granular.  No calculi are identified.

(15  cystic duct and TS neck; 16  TS body and LS fundus).

Fallopian tube 30x6mm with attached cystic ovary 35x30x25mm.  The fallopian cut surface is unremarkable.  The ovarian cut surface reveals multilocular cyst filled with thick serous fluid with adjacent haemorrhagic and firm white ovarian parenchyma.

(17  fallopian tube fimbrial end three LS and one TS mid; 18-20  ovary).

A fallopian tube 40x6mm with adjacent cystic ovary 45x40x25mm with attached strip of peritoneum 145x40x10mm.  A cyst is identified towards the fimbrial end filled with smooth serous fluid.  The ovarian cut surface reveals a multilocular cyst with adjacent oedematous ovarian stroma that has focal areas of haemorrhage.

(21  fallopian tube, two LS fimbrial end and one TS mid; 22-24  ovary; 25  haemorrhagic peritoneum).

Received fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 25x60x30mm and piece of fatty tissue with covering peritoneum 60x50x10mm.  Ill-defined thickening and haemorrhage is identified in the omentum over 60x60mm but no definite tumor deposits are identified.

(26-28  omentum; 29  peritoneum).  RS (M-29/ZH 5/2/2067 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Forshee)
Sections of the right hemicolectomy specimen show small and large bowel. An anastomosis is identified. There is serosal adhesions and in the serosal/adventitial fatty tissues, there is fat necrosis with macrophage reaction and with foreign body giant cells. Several lymph nodes are identified and show reactive changes.
Sections of the liver confirm four deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma including one subcapsular deposit. There is no involvement of the serosal surface and carcinoma is 5mm from the surgical margin. The remainder of the liver parenchyma is unremarkable.
Sections of the next described segment of liver demonstrate moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucin pools. The mucin pools of the tumour deposits are present at the inked/diathermied margin.
Sections of the gallbladder are unremarkable.
Sections of the first described fallopian tube and ovary show unremarkable fallopian tube and ovary with follicular cysts including luteinised follicular cysts.
Sections of the next described fallopian tube and ovary show normal appearing fallopian tube and ovary with follicular cysts including luteinised follicular cysts.
Sections of the omentum show patchy surface fibroblastic reaction and subsurface chronic inflammation. Sections of the peritoneum show focal foreign body giant cell reaction.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY
- SEROSAL FAT NECROSIS.
RIGHT HEPATECTOMY AND SEGMENT 4A
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
OVARIES
- LUTEINISED FOLLICULAR CYSTS.
