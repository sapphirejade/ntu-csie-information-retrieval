CLINICAL NOTES:
R pelvic side wall frozen section.  Redo peritonectomy.  Low grade mucinous appendiceal neoplasm.  Small bowel, colon, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SIDE WALL&amp;quot;.  Red tissue 15x10x8mm.  Consists of soft pale area 10mm diameter.

F/S : &amp;quot;Negative for malignancy&amp;quot;.  Reported to Fellow, Theatre 10 by Dr. O. Otinger at 1:12pm on 22.07.71.

(1 FS; 2 remainder).  AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Consists of portion of colon with multiple small pieces of fibrofatty tissue in the same jar.  Colon measures 120mm in length, 40mm maximum diameter.  Multiple adhesions over the serosa present.  There is a nodule attached to the serosa 15mm diameter filled with tan polypoid friable tissue.  Colonic wall appears thin, measures 1-2mm. There is an area of defect in the middle of thin wall 35mm ? perforation ? iatrogenic.  Area around the defect inked red. Mucosa appears flattened. Some nodularity present.
Multiple small fibrofatty tissue 50x30x30mm present.  Focal mucinous material identified.

(1 one surgical margin closer to defect; 2 LS inclluding defect; 3 sections of mucosal nodularity; 4&amp;amp;5 section of serosal nodule; 6 section of adhesions; 7 other surgical margin; 8-12 separate fibrofatty tissue including 8&amp;amp;9 one indurated area; 10-13 section of possible mucinous tumour deposit).  RS (M-13/SM 20/6/2071 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr O Medure)
A.  Permanent sections show fibroadipose tissue involved by cystic fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Sections of the macroscopically described 15mm serosal nodule show a cystic space containing organising extracellular mucin and strips of mucinous epithelium. The lesion is of overall low cellularity and the mucinous epithelium is predominantly arranged in strips and characterised by low cytologic atypia.  There is no evidence of destruction invasion, and the appearances are those of peritoneal involvement by low grade mucinous neoplasm / low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (PSOGI).

Sections of the macroscopically described &amp;quot;defect&amp;quot; show haemorrhage and congestion at the serosal surface, but no convincing evidence of granulation tissue response. The described mucosal nodularity is accounted for by mucosal lymphoid aggregates. The mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  Representative sections of the remaining tissue fragments show additional foci of fat necrosis and reactive fibrosis, together with five benign reactive lymph nodes.  No additional mucinous deposits are identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  RIGHT PELVIC SIDE WALL BIOPSY -
-CYSTIC FAT NECROSIS.
B.  COLON RESECTION AND PERITONEAL BIOPSIES -
-FOCAL INVOLVEMENT OF LARGE BOWEL SEROSA BY LOW GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI.
-FOCI OF CYSTIC FAT NECROSIS.
-FIVE BENIGN REACTIVE LYMPH NODES.
