HISTORY:  
Recent surgery - granulosa celltumour.  
Right ovary + tube.  Pelvic peritoneum 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  'RIGHT OVARY'  Received in multiple fragments, a ruptured ovary measuring in total 40x30x18mm.  A portion of fibrofatty tissue is attached measuring 20x15x10mm, but no definite tube is identified.  The outer surface is smooth and shiny.  The inner surface reveals multiple solid papillary areas with focal areas of haemorrhage.  Representative samples are taken.   (1-3 each one TSintact areas of the identified ovary; 4 representative of remaining fragments).  RS (M-4). Further: 5-8. Most tissue embedded. LV
B.  'POUCH OF DOUGLAS PERITONEUM'.  A fibrofatty piece of tissue 20x15x7mm with a ragged dark-brown firm area on the surface that is confirmed on the cut surface.  The outer surface is inked blue, serially sliced.  AE (M-1/MA/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  
A. Sections of show ovary with follicles in varying stages of maturation. In the deep ovarian cortex there are some clusters of disrupted granulosa cells, with the largest area within a follicle cyst. No granulosa cell tumour is seen in the ovary. 
B. The peritoneum has multiple rounded deposits ofsubsurface granulosa cell tumour the largest 2 mm in diameter. The granulosa cell tumour nodules have usual appearance.  There are some adjacent haemosiderin deposits. Also some rounded nodules with some foreign body giant cells are present suggestive reaction to previous instrumentation or similar.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. RIGHT OVARY:  Ovary tissue, benign changes.
B. POUCH OF DOUGLAS PERITONEUM: Deposits of granulosa cell tumour.
