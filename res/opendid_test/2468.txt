HISTORY:  
PMP, spleen, peritoneum. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
"SPLEEN, PERITONEAL DISEASE". 
A spleen weighing 200g and measuring up to 120x90x50mm. The capsular surface is ragged and haemorrhagic with multiple areas of gelatinous tumour depositon the surface. 
(1&2 representative tumour deposits; 3 uninvolved spleen).
Peritoneal disease - Multiple pieces of peritoneum measuring in aggregate 100x90x60mm. There is diffuse gelatinous tumour depositspresent. 
(4-6 RS; 7&8 tumour reserve block). RS (M-8/XS/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr E Ananias)
Sections of spleen show thickened capsule within which large locules of mucin are noted.  Within the mucinous area, there are strips of mucin secreting epithelium in keeping with low grade mucinous neoplasm.  Sections of peritoneum also show abundant extracellular mucin containingstrips of mucin epithelium showing low grade cytology.  A focus of liver tissue is seen adherent to the peritoneum.  There is also a lymph node showing lipogranuloma.  No high grade dysplasia is seen.  No evidence of stromal invasion.
Comment :  Histology would be in keeping with the clinical appearance of pseudomyxoma peritonei.
DIAGNOSIS:  
SPLEEN, PERITONEAL DISEASE - 
-LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM CONSISTENT WITH PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI.
