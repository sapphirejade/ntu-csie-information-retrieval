HISTORY:  
64 year old female with well differentiated mesothelioma.  
Right upper quadrant peritoneum.  Spleen, gallbladder,omentum and peritoneal strip.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE, SPLEEN".  A piece of omentum, spleen, gallbladder and a few pieces of peritoneum.  The spleen measures 110x85x50mm.  It weighs 176g.  On sectioning, no lesions are identified.  The gallbladder measures 85mm in length by 27mmby 30mm.  The pieces of peritoneum measure in aggregate 130x110x50mm.  There are no obvious lesions seen within the pieces of peritoneum.  The piece of omentum measures 290x120x35mm.  
(1&2 RS of the spleen; 3-5 RS of gallbladder [3 proximal surgical margin, 4 body of the specimen TS, 5 LS fundus]; 6-10 RS of peritoneum; 11-15 RS of omentum).  RS (M-15). Further blocks ( 16-18 each 2 TS splenic capsule; 19-23 firm areas at attached peritoneum). RS (M-23/YM) 
B.  "RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PERITONEUM".  A piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 90x45x10mm.  There is one nodular lesion seen on the surface of the peritoneum measuring 2mm in diameter.  
(1 possible nodular lesion on the peritoneum; 2-6 the rest of the peritoneum [all peritoneum embedded]).  RS (M-6/EZ/nh). Further blocks; 7-11 remnant specimen. AE (M-11/OJ)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr E Molenda)
A.  Sections of spleen appears unremarkable.  There is adhesion on the capsular surface.
The gallbladder is congested.  The mucosa is bile stained and focally denuded. There are mild changes of chronic cholecystitis with focal intestinal metaplasia.  
Sections of peritoneum show fibrous scarring and foreign body giant cell reaction. There are several foci of well differentiated mesothelioma present on the surface.  
B.  Sections from the nodular lesion shows changes consistent with well differentiated mesothelioma.  The surrounding area also shows small foci of mesothelial proliferation forming glands, also in keeping with mesothelioma. 
Immunohistochemistry stains show positive staining for calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin7, WT1.  
Negative:   cytokeratin 20, CEA, CDX2. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE, SPLEEN -
-FOCAL WELL DIFFERENTIATED MESOTHELIOMA. 
B.  RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PERITONEUM -
-FOCAL WELL DIFFERENTIATED MESOTHELIOMA.
