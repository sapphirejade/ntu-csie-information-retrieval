HISTORY:  
1. Uterus, tubes + ovaries.
2. Left pelvic nodes.
3. Right pelvic nodes.
4. Right parametrium.
5. Right common ileac nodes.
Adenocarcinoma cervix.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES".  Uterus with cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. The uterus with cervix measures 65x35x28mm. The specimen weighs 72g.  The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length with diameter up to 4mm.  The right ovary measures 30x15x7mm.  Left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with diameter up to 5mm.  Left ovary measures 22x14x7mm. The cervix measures 30mm in diameter. Anterior surgical margin inked blue, posterior black.  The cervix was amputated.  The cervix wassectioned longitudinally from right to left and all embedded. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(1-8 LS of the cervix from right to left, consecutive slices are embedded; 9 LS through the body of the uterus; 10LS of the fundus of the uterus; 11 LS of the right fimbrial end; 12 RS of the right fallopian tube; 13 TS of the right ovary; 14 RS of the right parametrial tissue; 15 LS of the left fimbrial end; 16 representative TS of the left fallopian tube; 17 section through the left ovary; 18 RS of the left parametrial tissue).  RS (M-18)
Further tissue:
Further tissue is taken and embedded.  
(19&20 LS from the body of the uterus right side with block 19 as the section closer to cervix and 20 closer to fundus; 21-25 TS of the right parametrial tissue with block 21 closest to the cervix and 25 closest to the fundus; 26&27 LS of the uterine body from the left side with 26 closer to cervix and 27 closer to fundus; 28-32 TS of the left parametrial tissue with block 28 being closer to the cervix and 32 being closer to the fundus).  (BW/ank)
B.  "LEFT PELVIC NODES".  Few pieces of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 30x30x15mm.  There are three lymph nodes found within this piece of tissue measuring 13, 12 and 10mm in maximal extent.  
(1 one lymph node sectioned transversely; 2 one lymph node sectioned transversely; 3 one lymph node sectioned transversely; 4 remainder of the fatty tissue).  AE (M-4)
C.  "RIGHT COMMON ILIAC NODE"  One lymph node measuring 13mm in maximal extent.
(1 one lymph node sectioned transversely).  AE (M-1)
D.  "RIGHT COMMON PELVIC NODE".  Few pieces of fat measuring in aggregate 30x30x10mm.  The specimen contains five lymph nodes measuring from 5-13mm in maximal extent.
(1 four lymph nodes; 2 one lymph node sectioned transversely; 3 remainder of the fatty tissue).  AE (M-3)
E.  "RIGHT PARAMETRIUM".  Multiple pieces of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 20x15x5mm.  AE (M-1/BR/ank)

CERVICAL CARCINOMA
Tumour Size:
Greatest dimension: 		4.3cm
+Additional dimensions: 	2.8 x 1.5cm
Tumour Site: 			Circumferential with extension into myometrium, vaginal cuff and right and left parametrial tissues
Histologic Type: 		Adenocarcinoma
Histologic Grade: 		G2: Moderately differentiated
Margins: 			
Margins involved by invasive carcinoma: 
-Carcinoma in lymphatic vessels extends to the right lateral paracervical soft tissue margin.
-Carcinoma also extends close (within 1mm) from the right vaginal cuff resection margin on the right.
Lymphovascular Invasion:	
-Present including in paracervical soft tissues on the right, in myometrium and right and left parametrial tissues
Pathologic Staging (pTNM [FIGO]):
pT2b [IIB]: tumour with parametrial invasion into left and right parametrium with direct and lymphovascular invasion.
Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):
pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
Specimen B : None out of 5 show metastatic tumour
Specimen C : None out of 1 show metastatic tumour
Specimen D : None out of 10 show metastatic tumour
Distant Metastasis:
-Not applicable
Additional Pathologic Findings:
-The endometrium is inactive.
-Both fallopian tubes and both ovaries show no significant abnormality.
Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive stainingwith p16 and CEA.
E.  Right Parametrium : 
-No significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:  
UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES: 
-MODERATELY  DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF CERVIX EXTENDING INTO VAGINAL CUFF, BODY OF UTERUS AND RIGHT AND LEFT PARAMETRIAL TISSUES.
LEFT PELVIC NODES :
-NO TUMOUR SEEN IN 5 LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.
RIGHT COMMON ILIAC NODE :
-NO TUMOUR SEEN IN 1 LYMPH NODE EXAMINED.
RIGHT COMMON PELVIC NODE :
-NO TUMOUR SEEN IN 10 LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.
RIGHT PARAMETRIUM :
-NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
