Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Simple endometrial hyperplasia.  CIN 2.   Previous breast Ca - on Tamoxifen.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 114g in total.  The uterus measures 72mm x 55mm x 43mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The cervical os appears tight and possibly scarred.  The endometrium measures 1 to 2mm thick with a myometrium measuring 18mm on the anterior aspect and 24mm on the posterior aspect.  The myometrium is disrupted by several well circumscribed pale fibroids measuring up to 13mm in maximal dimension identified on the anterior and posterior aspect.  No masses are identified.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm x 7mm and the right ovary measures 30 x 14mm x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube  measures 60mm x 6mm and the left ovary measures 25mm x 18 x 8mm.  The serosa surface is smooth and shiny and no lesions are seen on sectioning.
Blocks: 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 - full longitudinal sections through anterior body and cervix; 7 to 9 and 10 to 12 - full longitudinal sections through posterior body and cervix; 13 &amp;amp; 14 - right adnexa; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - left adnexa; 17 to 20 - blue inked (anterior cervix); 21 to 24 - black ink (posterior cervix) AE.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Posterior vaginal vault&amp;quot;, consists of an irregular piece of pale tissue, 7 x 7 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO:AP/eh 30/10/68)
