CLINICAL NOTES:
Frozen section right ovary and right fallopian tube, hx ovarian ca, peritonectomy, small bowel lesion, right diaphragm lesion, sigmoid mesentery, omentum, uterus, left ovary and tube, appendix, falciform.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT OVARY AND RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE&amp;quot;.  Right ovary and fallopian tube received fresh weighing 1206g.  There is an ovarian mass 180x110x100mm.  The capsule is smooth and complete.  The fallopian tube measures 95mm in length x 10mm in diameter with a 50mm paratubal cyst.  Solid area within a multicystic tumour approximately 160mm is sampled.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Mucinous adenocarcinoma&amp;quot;.  Phone results to Liver Registrar at 11:20am on 18.05.2069 by Dr. U. Buntain.

Additional history:  Appendix and colon appear normal.

Further description on fixation:  The tumour appears to involve entire ovary and has a solid cystic glistening cut surface with necrotic areas.  The paratubal cyst has a flattened smooth lining with focal nodularity.

(1  frozen section tissue from tumour; 2-10  ovarian tumour solid and cystic areas; 11-13  tube fimbrial end with a TS; 14  small ovoid nodule adherent to ovarian surface approximately 7mm; 15-20  pieces of paratubal cyst, small excrescence present in block 17 and 18).  RS (M-20).

Further blocks:  Right ovary and right fallopian tube.  (21-24  solid areas; 25-28  solid and cystic areas).  RS (8-8/JC 24/5/2066 km).

B.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL LESION&amp;quot;.  A strip of pink tissue 12mm in size.  AE (1-1).

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;.  Fatty tissue 7mm in size.  AE (1-1).

D.  &amp;quot;SIGMOID MESENTERY&amp;quot;.  Fatty tissue 20mm.  AE (1-1).

E.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, UTERUS, LEFT OVARY AND TUBE, APPENDIX, FALCIFORM LIGAMENT&amp;quot;.  A peritonectomy specimen with multiple components.  First is appendix 55mm in length, 6mm in diameter with mesoappendix 25mm wide.  The serosa is focally covered in adhesion.  The mucosa is cream with no lesion.  Cut surface shows no tumour.

(1  tip proximal end and one TS).

Part two of the specimen consists of left tube with attached ovary, 22.1g.  The tube with fimbrial end 55mm in length, 8mm in diameter.  The ovary 40x25x10mm.  The serosa of the tube is smooth, shiny.  Cut surface of the tube and ovary show no obvious tumour.  A separate uterus is present which is unopened weighing 153.8g measuring 90mm superior to inferior, 60mm cornu to cornu, 50mm anterior to posterior.  The cervix measures 30x30x10mm with a centrally placed os 9mm.  The ectocervix and the serosa of the uterus is smooth, shiny unremarkable.  When opened the endometrial cavity is 50mm in length.  The endometrial lining is up to 1mm thick and appears flat.  No polyps seen.  No lesions within the myometrium.

(2  fallopian tube fimbrial end; 3  transverse section of tube and ovary; 4  anterior cervix; 5  posterior cervix; 6  anterior wall; 7  posterior wall; 8  fundus).

Part three is a piece of ligament presumed falciform ligament comprising of fatty fibrous tissue 60x20x8mm.  There are fibrous adhesions covering the surface.  There is a cauterized end inked black.  On sectioning, no obvious lesion is seen. This piece of tissue is all embedded.

(9  cruciates of the cauterised end of falciform ligament; 10-12  TS).

Last part of specimen is omentum 500x200x20mm.  The omentum is covered in adhesion and appears focally haemorrhagic.  On sectioning, no lymph nodes or tumour deposits identified.  Also present are two strips of peritoneal tissue, 160x50x10mm and 60x60x15mm.  No tumour deposits identified.

(13&amp;amp;14  omentum; 15&amp;amp;16  peritoneal fat).  RS (M-16/JC 19/5/2066 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr U Westerman)
A. The tumour has been extensively sampled and sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma. The tumour is confined to the ovary with no evidence of involvement of the ovarian serosal surface. The carcinoma shows an expansile pattern of invasive growth characterised by marked glandular crowding with little intervening stroma. Cribriform architecture is not well-developed. Individual glands are characterised by marked irregularity of contour with prominent pseudopapilliform and papilliform architecture. The mucinous epithelium varies from low-grade to high-grade. In most areas, there is nuclear pseudo-stratification, moderate pleomorphism and relatively brisk mitotic activity. Occasional goblet cells are noted consistent with intestinal differentiation. No convincing destructive stromal invasion is seen in the sections. No anaplastic areas are seen. No lymphovascular space invasion is seen.

The surface ovarian ovoid nodule described macroscopically is a small serous cyst adenofibroma. Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable. The paratubal cyst is a serous cyst adenoma.

B. Sections show somewhat crushed and congested fibroadipose tissue with features suggestive of fat necrosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.

C. Sections show nodules of fat rimmed by mesothelium showing features of marked mesothelial hyperplasia. There is a small serous epithelial lined gland within the stroma. There is no evidence of malignancy.

D. Sections show fibrous tissue with surface mesothelium and deeper adipose tissue. Within the adipose tissue, there is a mesothelial  inclusion cyst. There is no evidence of malignancy.

E. Sections of the appendix show surface neutrophilic inflammation (peritonitis) without evidence of origin from the appendix. The mucosa, submucosa and muscularis are unremarkable.

Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show weak proliferative endometrium and the myometrium is unremarkable. Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable. A section of ovary shows focal surface mesothelial hyperplasia and is otherwise unremarkable.

Sections of the falciform ligament show features of peritonitis. There is no evidence of malignancy.

Representative sections of the omentum show patchy moderate to florid mesothelial  hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.

Comment (Specimen A): The mucinous adenocarcinoma maybe primary to ovary or metastatic. Suggest clinical correlation.

Immunostain panel
CK7, PAX 8: Positive
CDX2: Focal positive
CK20: Focal positive
MSI proteins ( block: A3)
MLH1:  Intact (normal)

Comment:
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The above diagnosis is unchanged.
