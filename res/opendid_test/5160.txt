HISTORY:  
Frozen section omental biopsy.  Appendix tumour peritonectomy.  Right colon and appendix, rectum, omentum, spleen, gallbladder.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "OMENTAL BIOPSY".  A piece of yellow firm tissue 25mm in maximum extent. Two transverse sections were examined for frozen section.
F/S : "Mucinous tumour low to moderate cellularity.  Some features of low grade mucinous tumour but with foci of epithelial budding and well differentiated is possible".  Reported to Prof. Vito by Dr. REESE PROUSE at 1010Hrs on 26.01.66
(1&2 remainder of FSs; 3 remainder of tissue).  AE (M-3)
B.  "OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, RIGHT COLON ANTERIOR RESECTION, PERITONEAL DISEASE".  
Omental cake with tumour. The omentum measures 540x210x50mm and contains firm mucinous tumour cake.  The spleen is adhered to the omentum and tumour. The spleen measures 110x60x40mm.  Cut surface reveals tumour on the external surface invading into spleen. The gallbladder is identified measures 80mm in length and up to 30mm in diameter.  The external surface is ragged with tumour adhered to the external surface. The tumour nodules range from 15 up to 25mm.  Caecal bladder was opened and was filled with bile. The wall measures 2mm thick. The mucosal surface is green and velvety. Also in specimen jar were multiple pieces of tumour cake and fatty tissue in aggregate 230x220x80mm.  The right hemicolectomy measures 240mm in length. The caecum measures up to 60mm in diameter and measures 90mm in length.  The terminal ileum measures up to 20mm in diameter. There is attached pericolic fat and mesentery.  Pericolic fat measures up to 120mm and mesentery measures up to 100mm. There are multipletumour nodules and tumour cake on the serosal surface of both the caecum and small bowel ranging from 3 up to 90mm.  The appendix is associated with the largest tumour nodule. The appendix measures 85mm in length and up to 50mm in diameter. The lumen is dilated and on cut sectioning the appendix communicates with the large tumour nodule.  The mucosal surface of the caecum and small bowel appear unremarkable Also in the specimen jar is the anterior resection which measures 290mm in length and the colon measures up to 30mm in diameter. There is attached pericolic fat up to 320mm. The pericolic fat contains multiple nodules and tumour cake ranging from 5 up to 120mm.  The mucosal surface of the colon is unremarkable.  Attached to the pericolic fat is the umbilicus which measures 50mm in length and up to 30mm in diameter. The skin appears unremarkable.  Cut sectioning of the rectum reveals tumour at the distal resection margin.  The umbilicus was transected and tumour is present.
(1-3 sections from the omental cake; 4&5 spleen with tumour; 6&7 gallbladder [6 TS from cystic duct and body, 7 LS from fundus with tumour]; 8-13 RS from the fibrofatty tissue withtumour; 14-29 from the hemicolectomy [14 distal resection margin, 15 proximal resection margin, 16-26 sections from the appendix from the proximal end to the distal end [25&26 are the tip LS]; 27 one lymph node; 28 one lymph node; 29 one lymph node; 30-32 from the anterior resection [30 distal resection, 31 proximal resection, 32 section of colon with attached tumour on the external surface]; 33&34 one section from the umbilicus bisected with tumour]).  RS (M-34/ZU/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Jurek)
A&B. Sections show low-grade mucinous neoplasmcomprising of extracellular lakes of mucin and associated with well-differentiated mucinous epithelium involving omentum including separate submitted omental biopsy (Specimen A), serosa of gallbladder, capsule of spleen with extension into splenic parenchyma, mesentery and serosa of caecum and appendiceal serosa and mesentery, separately submitted peritoneal fragments, omentum, umbilicus including subcutaneous tissues and dermis and perirectal soft tissues. 
tumour is seen to arise from a low-grade mucinous appendiceal neoplasm which shows evidence of rupture. 
Sections through the right hemicolectomy specimen show no focal mucosal abnormalities in colon or small bowel. The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesion. Four local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes. 
The splenic parenchyma shows no intrinsic abnormalities. 
The gallbladder mucosa and wall show no focal abnormalities. 
The rectal mucosa and wall are also unremarkable. 
No destructive tumour invasion with desmoplastic stroma is present. 
DIAGNOSIS:
DISSEMINATED LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM RESULTING IN PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI ARISING FROM LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS APPENDICEAL TUMOUR INVOLVING OMENTUM, SEROSA OF GALLBLADDER, SPLENIC CAPSULE AND PARENCHYMA, MESENTERY OF SMALL BOWEL AND RIGHT COLON, PERIRECTAL SOFT TISSUES, SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS AND UMBILICUS.
