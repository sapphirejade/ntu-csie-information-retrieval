CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Obesity.  Hypertension.  Endometrial cancer.  Diabetic.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Cervix uterus bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries weighing 90g in total.  The uterus measures 78 x 60 x 30mm and has smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 24 x 17mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning, the endometrium is less than 1mm thick distally and the myometrium is up to 20mm in maximum thickness.  There is a papilliform tumour within the endometrial cavity which is predominately located fundally.  The tumour appears to extend to a depth of 4mm.  The myometrium contains no fewer than five fibroids ranging in size from 2 to 9mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 45 x 7 x 6mm and the right ovary measures 33 x 20 x 15mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 40 x 7 x 6mm and the left ovary measures 32 x 18 x 15mm with an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 -anterior LS uterus and cervix; 4 LS fundus; 5 to 7 - posterior LS uterus and cervix; 8 - posterior LS fundus;9 - LS complete fimbrial end right fallopian tube, plus mid TS; 10 - right ovary; 11 - LS complete fimbrial end leftfallopian tube, plus mid TS; 12 - left ovary.  RS.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Magathan):
Sections show an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2.  The lesion has a predominantly glandular architecture, and is composed of back-to-back cribriform glands lined by tumour cells with moderate atypia.  Approximately 30% of the lesion has a solid architecture, in keeping with a grade of 2.  
No lymphovascular invasion is seen.
The tumour is confined to the endometrium.
Superficial adenomyosis and benign leiomyomas are seen in the myometrium. The cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries show no evidence of malignancy.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
To follow in an additional report.
DIAGNOSIS
Uterus and cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2, confined to the endometrium
ADDITIONAL REPORT (24/2/66)

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
