CLINICAL:
Breast cancer hormone positive.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 157g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 105 x 75 x 35mm.  The ectocervix is 35 x 35mm.  The endometrium is <1mm thick.  The myometrium is 24mm thick.  There is a left lower uterine segment fibroid, 30 x 25 x 40mm, which has a slight yellow discolouration.  An area of haemorrhage lies adjacent to the fibroid.  The left fallopian tube is 40mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The left ovary is 25 x 118 x 15mm.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The right ovary is 26 x 20 x 12mm.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 9 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 10 & 11 - fibroid with adjacent haemorrhage; 12 to 15 - left fallopian tube serially embedded; 16 to 20 - left ovary serially embedded; 21 to 24 - right fallopian tube serially embedded; 25 to 30 - right ovary serially embedded; 31 to 34 - further sections of fibroid.  Ovaries and fallopian tubes all embedded.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Rauelo):
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  The lower uterine segment nodule is a cellular leiomyoma, which demonstrates diffuse strong positive staining with desmin and patchy weak positive staining for CD10.There is no associated cytologic atypia or necrosis, and mitoses are not readily identifiable (0/10HPF).  
The fallopian tubes and ovaries have been entirely embedded and show foci of endosalpingiosis over both the tubal and ovarian serosa.  
There is no evidence of in-situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
-  Cellular leiomyoma.
-  Endosalpingiosis of tubal and ovarian serosa.
