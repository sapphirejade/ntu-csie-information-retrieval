MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries plus cervix" consists of a uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 210g in toal.  The uterus comprises of corpus and cervix measuring 120 x 65 x 45mm.  The ectocervix is 65 x 55mm.  The attached posterior vaginal wall cuff measures 55 x 25mm.  The left cervical margin is inked blue and the right cervical margin is inked black.  Occupying predominantly the anterior cervix is an ulcerated exophytic tumour, 55 x 25 x 30mm.  The tumour has a multinodular appearance over the entire anterior ectocervix.  The tumour infiltrates through almost the full thickness of the anterior cervical wall and is 1mm clearof the cervical margin.  The endometrium is 1mm in thickness and shows no significant abnormality.  The myometrium is up to 26mm thick.  The right ovary is 30 x 20 x 15mm and contains a15mm simple cyst.  The right fallopian tube is 50mm in length.  The left ovary is 40 x 25 x 18mm and contains a 30mm unilocular cyst.  The left fallopian tube is 50mm in length.  Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 12 - anterior ectocervix serially embedded from right to left; 13 to 26 - anterior upper ectocervix serially embedded from rightto left; 27 to 35 - endocervix serially embedded from right to left; 36 to 38 - anterior uterine body; 39 & 40 - shave posterior vaginal cuff margin; 41 to 51 - posterior ectocervix serially embedded from left to right; 52 to 56 - posterior endocervix serially embedded from left to right; 60 & 61 - right ovary and fallopian tube; 62 & 63 - left ovary and fallopian tube.  Please see block diagram.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 45mm across.  Three lymph nodes are identified, 4-15mm across. 
Blocks:  1 - multiple lymph nodes.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of adiposetissue, 25mm across.  Three lymph nodes are identified, 5-12mm across.  
Blocks:  1- multiple lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 65mm across.  One lymphnode is identified, 55mm across.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one lymph node.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a lymph node, 45mm across.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one lymph node.  AE.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a lymph node, 25mm across.  AE 1 block.  (RG/mm 3.9.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Dirth/Dr D Chriswell):
A.  Sections show a 55mm poorly differentiated carcinoma involvingthe cervix.  The carcinoma is predominantly a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (more than 90%), composed of islands, trabeculae and rosettes of malignant cells with scant cytoplasm and evenly distributed chromatin.  Mitoses are brisk.Areas of geographic necrosis are also seen.  The tumour contains a minor component of cells with squamoid features (5%) as well as focal areas with glandular differentiation (less than 5%).  No keratinisation is seen. 
The tumour has a circumscribed pushing border and invades into the outer half of the cervical wall.  Carcinoma is 1.5mm clear of the anterior cervical resection margin (block A21).  All other margins are well clear.  The vaginal cuff is unremarkable.  The tumour is confined to the cervix and does not involve the vaginal wall.  Extensive lymphovascular invasion is seen throughout the cervix.  
The benign endocervical epithelium contains scattered goblet cells.  No cervical squamous or glandular dysplasia is seen.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The uterine serosa is unremarkable.  Both ovaries contain benign follicular cysts; otherwise the ovaries and both fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  Three (3) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Three (3) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymphnodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is involved by metastatic small cell carcinoma.
E.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  One (1) lymphnode is identified.  The lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
-  Small cell carcinoma of cervix
-  Invades outer half of cervix
-  Margins clear
-  Extensive lymphovascular invasion
-  Fallopian tubes and ovaries uninvolved
B.  Right external iliac lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/3)
C.  Left external iliac lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/3)
D.  Right obturator lymph node:  Metastatic small cell carcinoma (1/1)
E.  Left obturator lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/1)
F.  Right common iliac lymph node:  No evidence of malignancy (0/1).
