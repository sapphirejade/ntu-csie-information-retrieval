CLINICAL NOTES:
Past peritonectomy.  Frozen section appendix adenocarcinoma ? recurrent dx.  Appendix cancer, small intestine, peritoneal tumour.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL NODULE&amp;quot;.  Consists of pink tissue 10x5x5mm in aggregate and mucin 10x10x5mm in aggregate.  Tissue and mucin frozen on different chucks.

F/S : &amp;quot;Adenocarcinoma&amp;quot;.  Reported to Bialas (Liver Fellow) by Dr. P. Pech at 10:15am on 21.9.67.  AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE, SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue and bowel tissue fragments, received piecemeal, measuring 90x80x60mm in aggregate.  The outer surface of larger pieces are inked blue, and serially sliced. Sectioning shows irregular ill defined fibrotic surfaces.  Multiple foci of mucinous  deposits are also identified.  RS (M-10/SM 18/6/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr P Lukins)
A. Paraffin sections confirm the nodule to be a deposit of mucinous adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring differentiation.

B. Sections show fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle infiltrated by a moderately to poorly  differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring morphology. There is abundant mucin in some areas. Several foci of perineural invasion are seen but no lymphovascular invasion is present in the sections examined. Fragments of small bowel are also present, and are unremarkable. One lymph node present shows reactive changes and there are foci of foreign body reaction to suture material.

The features are in keeping with the known history of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  SMALL BOWEL NODULE -
- ADENOCARCINOMA
B. PERITONEAL DISEASE, SMALL BOWEL-
-  ADENOCARCINOMA
