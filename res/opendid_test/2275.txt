HISTORY:
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cervix. 
Right parametrial node, right pelvic nodes. Uterus tubes and bilateral ovaries. Left pelvic lymph node. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "RIGHT PARAMETRIAL TISSUE NODE". Fibrofatty tissue which measures 5x5x5mm. AE (1-1).
B. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". A fibrofatty tissue measuring 30x20x5mm altogether. Three possible nodes are present. AE (M-2).
C. "UTERUS, TUBES AND BILATERAL OVARIES". A uterus with bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes. The tissue measures 65x30x10mm. There is a lesion in the cervix which appears to involve the whole cervix which measures 25x10mm. Theuterus inked anterior blue, posterior black. There is a short vaginal cuff attached which is inked red. The cervix is cut transversely from left to right as per diagram. The left ovary measures 30x20x3mm. The left fallopian tube measures 35x7x2mm. The right ovary measures 30x10x5mm. The left fallopian tube measures 35x4x2mm. 
Serial sectioning of the cervix reveals a pale tumour predominantly involving the anterior aspect of the cervix which measures 25mm wide with a horizontal extent of 25mm. The maximum depth of invasion is approximately 9mm. The tumour appears clear of the local margins of excision. The endometrium is 1mm thick. The myometrium is unremarkable. 
(1-18 cervix consists of the lesion; 19 body of uterus; 20 fundus of uterus; 21&22 left ovary; 23 left fimbria; 24 three TS of left fallopian; 25&26 right ovary; 27 right fimbria; 28 three TS of fallopian tube; 29 parametrial tissue).
D. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES". Fatty tissue which measures 40x20x5mm. Four possible nodes present. (1- one node 2 - 3nodes). AE (M-2/UM/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Cichy)
A.  Histology shows fatty tissue containing medium and large calibre vessels. One vessel contains a calcified thrombus (i.e. a phlebolith). No lymph nodal tissue is present. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  No evidence of malignancy is seen inthree lymph nodes. 
C.  Histology shows much of the anterior lip of the cervix to be replaced by a large invasive carcinoma which grows in a sheet like and trabecular fashion within stromawhich contains prominent numbers of lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells with tumour infiltrating lymphocytes also present. The tumour cells have moderately atypical nuclei with prominent mitotic activity, which is up to 10 mitoses per single hpf (x 400). No definite areas of keratinisation or glandular differentiation are seen. Mucin stains are negative. Immunostains show positivity for cytokeratin 5/6 and P16 with negativity for P63 and CEA. Overall morphology favours that of invasive lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma which appears undifferentiated (i.e grade 3). Tumour has a horizontal spread of approximately 25mm with a maximum depth of invasion of 9mm (ie FIGO stage 1B1). Local excision is complete with 6mm to the closest anterior cervical soft tissue margin and 9mm posteriorly. There is noinvolvement of the vaginal cuff. No evidence of lymphatic vascular invasion is identified. No evidence of a pre-existing squamous CIN lesion or AIS is identified. Quite strikingly in places, however, there is evidence of intraepitheliallymphocytosis within the adjacent endocervical epithelium and also in the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. No evidence of malignancy is seen in three small lymph nodes found within the parametrium. The endometrium is atrophic and there is focal adenomyosis within the myometrium. Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary contains a small simple serous cyst with both ovaries otherwise unremarkable with no evidence of malignancy identified. 
D.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in four lymph nodes. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.RIGHT PARAMETRIAL TISSUE - 
 - CALCIFIED PHLEBOLITH WITHIN A SMALL VESSEL, NO LYMPH NODE TISSUE IDENTIFIED. 
B.  RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - 
  - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 3 NODES. 
C.  UTERUS, TUBES AND BILATERAL OVARIES - 
- LYMPHOEPITHELIOMA-LIKE CARCINOMA OF CERVIX, FIGO STAGE 1B1. RESECTIONS MARGINS CLEAR. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 3 NODES. 
D.  LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - 
 - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 4 NODES.
