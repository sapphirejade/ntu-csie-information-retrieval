MICROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;WOUND I&amp;quot;.  Fibrous tissue 12x10x8mm.  One piece for frozen section.

(1 FS; 2 remainder tissue).  AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;WOUND II&amp;quot;. Fibromuscular piece of tissue 20x12x8mm in aggregate.  One piece embedded for frozen section.

(1 FS; 2 remainder tissue). AE (M-2)

C.  &amp;quot;WOUND III&amp;quot;. Fibrous tissue 16x12x5mm in aggregate.  One piece embedded for frozen section.

(1 FS; 2 remainder tissue).  AE (M-2)

D.  &amp;quot;WOUND IV&amp;quot;.  Fibrous tissue 10x5x5mm.  All embedded for frozen section.  AE (M-1)

F/S (A-D) : &amp;quot;Scar tissue with scattered atypical cells ? reactive fibroblasts, cannot exclude involvement by poorly differentiated signet ring cell carcinoma&amp;quot;.  Reported to Registrar by Dr. Dr. D. Neigh on 19.5.70.

E.  &amp;quot;TRANSVERSE COLON, COMPLETION GASTRECTOMY, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE, GALLBLADDER&amp;quot;.  Received multiple tissue fragments.

The main specimen consists of a partial gastrectomy including the proximal stomach 113x70mm with a part of distal oesophagus 20mm in maximum diameter. This is attached to duodenum with anastomosis 190x30mm and a blind loop of jejunum 40x30mm, attached mesentery up to 60mm.  The oesophageal resection margin is inked red, the surrounding circumferential margin inked blue, the staple line (previous surgery) stomach resection margin is inked green. The duodenal distal margin is inked black and the blind loop is inked blue.

Multiple adhesions are identified on the outer surface with marked adhesions towards the distal edge of the specimen.  There is thickening of the serosa with adjacent thickened wall at the proximal stomach at the serosal aspect of the COJ.  No definite luminal polyps or tumours are identified. There is a serosal nodule in the small bowel mesentery measuring 8x6x6mm surrounded by multiple enlarged lymph nodes are identified.

(1 proximal oesophageal resection margin; 2 continuous of block 1 at COJ; 3-5 RS stomach stapled resection margin from proximal to distal; 6 gastroduodenal anastomosis; 7 small bowel to small bowel anastomosis; 8 duodenal resection margin; 9 blind loop resection margin; 10&amp;amp;11 RS gastric body; 12 mesenteric nodule; 13 ? five lymph nodes)

Transverse colon 260x50mm with attached mesocolon up to 45mm.  A segment of omentum is attached up to 40mm.  Multiple adhesions are identified on the outer surface.  No definite tumour nodules are seen.  The lumen is unremarkable.  No polyps or tumours are identified.

(14&amp;amp;15 each one LS of resection margin; 16 adhesions; 17 omentum)

A gallbladder 110x30mm. The outer surface is smooth with minute overlying adhesions. The wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces are green and granular.  No calculi are identified.

(18 cystic duct and TS neck; 19 TS body and LS fundus).

Received multiple fibrofatty and muscular pieces of tissue. The largest measures 55x35x30mm. The remainder has a covering peritoneum 75x60x10mm in aggregate. The cut surface is firm across the specimen.

(20-22 RS).  RS (M-22)

F.  &amp;quot;DUODENAL STUMP&amp;quot;.  A stapled segment of small bowel 40x30mm with attached piece of fibrofatty tissue with peritoneal covering 40x30x10mm.  The free staple line is inked blue.  The serosal surface has multiple adhesions and ragged haemorrhagic minute nodules.

(1 TS across the specimen; 2&amp;amp;3 continuous one TS across the specimen).  RS (M-3/ZH 24/5/2068 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr D Burnap)
A,B,C,D.  Histology shows areas of immature fibrous scarring adjacent to some skeletal muscle and fibrous fascial tissue with a patchy foreign body giant cell reaction and non specific chronic inflammation.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

E.  Histology from the stomach shows multiple areas of residual poorly differentiated diffuse type gastric adenocarcinoma. Carcinoma is found throughout most of the sampled stomach over an area approximately 70mm wide, coming to within 1mm of the old / previous stapled gastric margin and infiltrates throughout the submucosa, which is markedly fibrotic and focally extends through muscularis propria into subserosal fibrous tissue.  Carcinoma cells extend to within 0.5mm of the free serosal surface but do not actually reach it (T3). Carcinoma also extends very close to the anastomosis with the small bowel. The proximal oesophageal and distal duodenal margins are well clear of malignancy (&amp;gt;10mm).  There is widespread submucosa fibrosis which is consistent with a partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TRS 2).  No evidence of vascular, lymphatic or perineural is seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy in 6 local perigastric lymph nodes.

The segment of transverse colon shows serosal fibrosis with no evidence of malignancy. The omentum shows patchy nonspecific mild chronic inflammation with focal fibrosis but with no evidence of malignancy  is seen.  The gallbladder shows minor mucosal chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy seen over the serosal surface.  There are also multiple other pieces of fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle containing a broad area of maturing fibrous scar tissue associated with suture granulomas and nonspecific chronic inflammation.  No malignancy is seen in these fragments of tissue.

F.  Histology shows duodenum with adjacent fibrous scarring and foreign body granulomas and adjacent fatty tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  A small amount of diathermied liver tissue is also present adjacent to some sutures.  A small amount of diathermied pancreas is also present focally.
