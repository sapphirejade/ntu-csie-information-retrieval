HISTORY:  
GI endometrioid adeno CA.
Uterus tubes and ovaries, omental biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "L + R TUBES AND OVARIES, UTERUS, CERVIX". An already coronally opened total hysterectomy specimen consists of a uterus with cervix, measuring 85x40x35mm, with cervix, 30x27x20mm. Attached is right tube, 70x6mm, right ovary, 45x20x16mm, left tube, 50x7mm and left ovary, 25x15x11mm. The outer surface of the uterus is smooth and tan in colour. Areas of possible scarring are noted at the anterior isthmus area. In the body area, there is an exophytic tumour, measuring 22mm, appears to be arising from the uterine body. No definite invasion is seen macroscopically. It is exophytic but appears to be confined to the body. The remainding endometrial tissue has a thickness of 3mm. The tumour is well clear from cornus. The cut surface of the right ovary reveals a cystic structure with smooth inner lining and is filled with clear serous fluid, it is pushing the normal ovary tissue peripherally. The cut surface of the remaining tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
(1 right tube [two LS fimbrial end & one TS]; 2 right ovary [one TS & right tube, one TS]; 3 two TS of the cyst at right ovary; 4 right parametrium; 5 left tube [two LS fimbrial end & one TS mid]; 6 left ovary [one TS & left tube, one TS]; 7 left parametrium; 8-10 continuous piece, anterior uterus [8 anterior cervix; 9 anterior isthmus with part of tumour; 10 anterior body]; 11&12 continuous piece, with tumour; 13 one TS tumour with anterior resection margin; 14-16 posterior uterus [14 posterior cervix; 15 posterior isthmus and body; 16 posterior body and fundus]; 17 posterior body). RS (M-17)
B. "OMENTAL BIOPSY". Received in multiple fragments, unorientated fibrofatty pieces of tissue, measuring 40x20x16mm in aggregate, has an unremarkable outer cut surface. AE (M-2/FO/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr X Landro)
A.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma of the anterior body, which is confined to the endometrium, with no myometrium invasion seen.  The tumour has a papillary and glandular architecture, and is predominantly exophytic.  
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA: 
Tumour type:  Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma
FIGO grade:  1
(architecture grade:  1, nuclear grade:  2)
Myometrial invasion:  None (confined toendometrium)
Depth of myometrial invasion:   0mm
Myometrial thickness:   25mm
% of myometrium invaded:   0%
Focality:  Unifocal
Tumour involves: Anterior body.There is no involvement of the fundus, lower uterine segment, cervical glands, cervical stroma or parametrium.    
Vascular/lymphatic invasion:  Not seen
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Involvement of uterine serosa:  Not involved
Excision margins:  Well clear of tumour
Non-tumour uterus:  
Adjacent endometrium:  Shows possible focal simple hyperplasia.  Elsewhere the endometrium appears atrophic.  
Polyps:  No
Adenomyosis:  Present
Adnexae:  
Left fallopian tube:  Unremarkable
Right fallopian tube:  Unremarkable
Left ovary:  Unremarkable
Right ovary:  A small serous cystadenoma is confirmed within the right ovary. The remainder of the right ovary is unremarkable.
Lymph nodes:  No lymph nodes are identified
Other:  A small leiomyoma is identified within the anterior body of uterus.  

Pathologic Staging (AJCC/UICC TNM 7, FIGO 2008):

TNM stage: pT1a
FIGO stage: 1A (Tumour confined to the corpus uteri with no or less than half myometrial invasion)
B.  Sections of omentum show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  L AND R TUBES AND OVARIES, UTERUS AND CERVIX :
-GRADE 1 ENDOMETRIOID ENDOMETRIAL ADENOCARCINOMA, CONFINED TO ENDOMETRIUM WITH NO MYOMETRIAL INVASION.  FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE TEXT.
B.  OMENTAL BIOPSY :
-NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (1/5/66):
The slides ofthis case were reviewed as a result of a clinicopathological meeting held on the 13/1/2065 at BALRANALD MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Hospital. Review of the curettings (Lab No: 82E63677) from the 12/1/2065 shows somefocal areas with an appearance suggestive of a component of possible serous carcinoma. Review of the hysterectomy slides (Lab No: 82E63677), shows that there is a small area in one of the slides (A17), showing a 3mm area of carcinoma with a more solid architecture, and moderate to marked nuclear atypia. The remainder of the tumour in the initial sections examined (Blocks A2-A16) show low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma. However, in view of the findings in the curettings, and the small amount of higher     grade tumour in Block A17, further blocks of the hysterectomyspecimen were embedded and examined (Blocks A18-A20, anterior body, A21 - A23 posterior body). These show several additional areas of high-grade carcinoma, some of which has solid architecture with Grade 3 nuclei, and in other areas, the architecture is papillary, but also with Grade 3 nuclei. A p53 immunohistochemical stain on Blocks A20 to A23 shows very variable nuclear staining. In some areas, the majority of tumour cells are negative, with scattered weak to moderate staining of some nuclei. However, in conjunction with the findings in the curetting specimen, the features most likely represent a mixed low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma and high-grade serous carcinoma, with over 25% of the tumour in the additional sections examined being composed of serous carcinoma. No myometrial invasion is seen in the additional  tissue embedded. 
Please also see supplementary report on the curetting specimen 82E63677.
REVISED DIAGNOSIS:
A. L + R TUBES AND OVARIES, UTERUS, CERVIX:
- MIXED HIGH-GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA AND LOW-GRADE ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, CONFINED TO ENDOMETRIUM (PLEASE SEE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT).  
B. OMENTAL BIOPSY:
- NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.

FURTHER SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (1/5/66):
Supplementary report:
Immunostains for MSI proteins (Tech Data Corporation CULCAIRN MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE HOSPITAL Lab; block: A10)
MLH1: Positive staining of tumour nuclei
PMS2: Positive staining of tumour nuclei
MSH2: Negative 
MSH6: Equivocal staining (most nuclei negative; focal weakly positive nuclei)

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigations, including MSI testing where possible.
