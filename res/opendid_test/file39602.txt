CLINICAL NOTES:
Appendiceal Ca, peritonectomy, previous appendicectomy, bilateral ovaries, right tube, gallbladder, right hemicolectomy, fatty tumour base of mesentery x2, portocaval lymph node, right pelvic stump.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  A lymph node with partially fatty cut surface 20x10x5mm.  The cut surface is tan.  Serially sliced.  AE (M-1).

B.  &amp;quot;FATTY TUMOUR BASE OF MESENTERY&amp;quot;.  Two unorientated fatty pieces of tissue, 30x25x17mm and 30x25x22mm.  The outer surface of the larger fragment has peritoneal covering on one edge.  The margins are inked blue.  The smaller fragment cut surface reveals a well demarcated tan nodule, 16x10x7mm with surrounding fatty tissue.  Similar firm white nodule is identified on the larger fragment measuring 24x9x5mm.  It is well clear of the margin macroscopically.

(1&amp;amp;2  TS of smaller fragment; 3&amp;amp;4  each one TS larger fragment).  RS (4-4).

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE, LEFT OVARY, OMENTUM, PERITONEUM&amp;quot;.  Received in one specimen jar multiple tissue fragments including;

A right hemicolectomy specimen consists of a terminal ileum 175x25mm, caecum and ascending colon 190x60mm, mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 100mm.  No appendix is identified. The anatomical site of appendix base is haemorrhagic with an adjacent defect 20x6mm (? iatrogenic) .  The serosal surfaces have multiple adhesions but no tumor deposits are identified. The mucosal surface reveals a caecal polyp at the possible site of appendicial orifice  measures 9x7x5mm. It has firm white cut surface. This polyp is located 235mm of proximal and 160mm of distal margins. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are identified within the mesentery one of which measuring 16 mm in maximum diameter and is totally replaced by mucinous tumor.

(1  proximal and distal resection margins; 2-6  anatomical site of appendiceal orifice [3-5  including polyp]; 7  apical lymph node four TS; 8  next most apical lymph nodes four TS; 9  six lymph nodes; 10  one lymph node ?involved, five TS; 11  six lymph nodes ;12  one lymph node trisected; 13  one lymph node bisected; 14  ?six lymph nodes; 15  one lymph node bisected; 16  six lymph nodes; 17  one lymph node bisected; 18  ?six lymph nodes).

A gallbladder 60x25mm.  The outer surface is smooth and glistening.  The wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces have extensive yellow flaking.  No calculi are identified.

(19  cystic duct and TS neck; 20  TS body and LS fundus).

An ovary 20x10x13mm.  The cut surface is variegated white and tan.  No discrete lesions are seen.

(21&amp;amp;22  RS multiple TS of ovary).

A fallopian tube 35x10mm with attached ovary 20x13x10mm.  Attached is a strip of peritoneum, 120x25mm.  The outer and cut surface of tube and ovary is unremarkable.  Focal area of haemorrhage is identified on the serosal surface.

(23  two LS fimbrial end and one TS ovary and adjacent tube; 24  TS ovary and adjacent tube; 25  peritoneum).

A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum 300x155x50mm.  Scattered area of ragged, haemorrhagic surfaces are seen but no definite tumour deposits are identified.

(26-28  omentum).

Received fibrofatty piece of tissue with covering peritoneum 110x95x25mm.  The cut surface reveals yellow homogenous fatty surface.

(29  representative).  RS (M-29/ZH 7/1/2071 km).

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr F Haring)
A. No evidence of malignancy is seen in one node.

B. No evidence of malignancy is seen in two lymph nodes which are surrounded by abundant mature fatty tissue.

C. Within the caecum in the area of the appendiceal orifice is an area of residual adenoma with low-grade dysplasia with area of fibrous scarring within the muscularis propria with focal entrapped acellular mucin. No serosal deposits of mucinous carcinoma are seen. However, within 1 of 36 mesocolic lymph nodes, there is complete replacement by metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. A rare signet ring cell is seen in the mucus. No extranodal extension is seen. There is no evidence of vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion. The resection margins are unremarkable. The gallbladder shows mild cholesterolosis of the mucosa. Both ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The other pieces of omentum and peritonealised tissue show no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. PORTACAVAL LYMPH NODE
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 1 NODE.
B. FATTY TUMOUR BASE OF MESENTERY
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 2 NODES.
C. RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE, LEFT OVARY, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM
- METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA IN 1 OF 36 MESOCOLIC LYMPH NODES.
