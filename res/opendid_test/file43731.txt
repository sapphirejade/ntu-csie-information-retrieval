Pathology ReportADDITIONAL REPORT (28/4/70)

CLINICAL:
Left mastectomy.  Palpable lesion central breast.  Stitch 12 o&amp;apos;clock.  Long lateral.  Please biobank. Consent in notes.  Bowel prolapse, AF, HTN.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left mastectomy long stitch lateral on axilla short stitch superior&amp;quot;, consists of a mastectomy with orienting sutures in situ, weighing 210g.  The specimen measures 180mm medial to lateral, 110mm superior to inferior, and 25mm superficial to deep.  There is overlying ellipse of skin, 180 x 90mm.  The nipple measures 13mm in diameter.  The nipple and skin show no significant abnormality.  The superosuperficial margin is inked blue, inferosuperficial margin is inked green, and deep margin is inked black.  On sectioning, there is a pale grey tumour, 19 x 18 x 17mm, located at the 3 to 4 o&amp;apos;clock position, 5mm from the nipple.  The tumour is 5mm from the closest deep margin, and greater than 10mm from all other margins.  The tumour appears to abut the skin surface.  The remaining breast tissue has a fibrofatty appearance, with areas of dense fibroadipose tissue, predominantly located centrally.  There is 7mm intramammary lymph node at the medial aspect of the specimen.
Blocks: 1 - tumour and skin; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - tumour, skin, and deep margin; 4 - superior margin; 5 - inferior margin; 6 - medial margin; 7 - lateral margin; 8 - nipple; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - central fibrous tissue; 11 - upper inner quadrant; 12 - lower inner quadrant; 13 - upper outer quadrant; 14 - lower outer quadrant; 15 - intramammary lymph node.  See diagram.  (TO:JB/eh 27/4/70)

Tubules:  3    Nuclei:  3      Mitoses:  2    Mitotic rate: 9/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion:  Not seen

DCIS component:
Not seen.

Excision Margins:
Deep: 8mm
Other margins: &amp;gt; 10mm

HER2 SISH:  Performed at MACQUARIEWARD, THE ROYAL WOMEN'S HOSPITAL Hospital, see separate report.

Nipple:  No evidence of Paget&amp;apos;s disease

LCIS/ALH:  Not seen

Miscellaneous:
- Perineural invasion is seen.
- Extensive sclerosis and dystrophic calcification are seen adjacent to the lesion, suggestive of previous excision.
- A probable core biopsy tract is present.
- An intra-parenchymal lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
