CLINICAL:
IBI cervix cancer.  Radical hysterectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Vaginal margin, uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 133g in total.  There is a vaginal cuff margin extending from the cervix to approximately (15mm) in length.  The anterior surgical margin is inked blue and the posterior black.  The uterus measures 105 x 55 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 45 x 35mm and has a tan nodular mass on the posterior ectocervix extending into the posterior vaginal cuff margin over an area of 18 x 15mm.  The anterior ectocervix appears shiny and unremarkable with no mass lesions identified.  The endometrium is 5mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 17mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium contains one fibroid measuring 18mmin maximum dimension.  Otherwise the myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 42mm in length x 7mm in maximum dimension. The right ovary measures 22 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. The left fallopian tube measures 37mm in length x 7mm in maximum diameter. The left ovary measures 22 x 12 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The lesion on the posterior ectocervix appearsto be constrained to the upper 3mm of the ectocervix.  The tumour is 3mm from the posterior vaginal cuff margin.  There is an extra piece of epithelised tissue measuring 33 x 15 x5mm.  No lesion is apparent on the smooth surface.  The ragged surface is inked black.  Block 1-4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5-7 - anterior left cervix from medial to lateral; 8-11 - anterior right cervix from medial to lateral; 12-15 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 16-19 -posterior right cervix from medial to lateral; 20-23 - posterior left cervix from medial to lateral; 24 - right fallopian tube and ovary; 25 - left fallopian tube; 26 - left ovary; 27 - fibroid; 28-32 - extra piece of tissue, serially sectioned, AE.  
B.   Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 110 x 70 x 15mm.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 2-23mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - lymph nodes as seen; 3 - ? lymph nodes. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 80 x 40 x 25mm.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3-40mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1 & 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 4 - lymph nodes as seen; 5 - one lymph node bisected; 6 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 7 - lymph nodes as seen. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 75 x 40 x 30mm.  Lymphnodes are identified ranging from 5-32mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - lymph nodes as seen. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 45 x 18mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3-30mm in maximum dimension.   The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - one lymph node bisected; 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 5 - lymph nodes as seen.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 25mm in maximum dimension containinglymph nodes ranging from 5-8mm.  Specimen AE.  Block 1- lymph nodes as seen; 2 - rest of tissue.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 50 x 40 x 15mm. Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3-20mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  Block1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - lymph nodes as seen. 
(TO: NQ;PT/ec  7.1.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Belanger): 
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix (predominantly adenocarcinoma approximately 80%).  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 13mm through a wall 15mm thick, has a length of 36mm and an estimated width of 32mm.  
Carcinoma extends to within 9mm of the anterior vaginal margin and 3.4mm of the posterior vaginal margin.  The extra piece ofvaginal tissue received is normal.  No convincing lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable. 
B.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Thirteen lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Nine lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix, depth 13mm through a wall 15mm thick, length 36mm, width 32mm.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Thirty eight (38) lymph nodes are negative.
