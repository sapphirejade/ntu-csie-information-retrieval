CLINICAL NOTES:
Previous low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm that was perforated.  Peritonectomy today.
Peritonectomy specimen - omentum, spleen, gallbladder, right hemicolectomy, anterior resection, bilateral ovaries, peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OMENTUM, SPLEEN, ANTERIOR RESECTION, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received in one specimen jar multiple tissue fragments including :

A right hemicolectomy specimen consists of terminal ileum 190x35mm. Attached is a segment of right colon including caecum and ascending colon, 90x40mm.  Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 50mm.  No appendix is identified but at the appendiceal orifice there is a scar 13x5mm.  The serosal surface is inked blue. Multiple mucinous deposits covering the small bowel wall and mesentery.  No intraluminal polyps or tumours are identified.

(1 proximal and distal resection margin; 2 appendiceal orifice scar; 3 small bowel involvement; 4&amp;amp;5 large bowel mesenteric involvement; 6 ? four lymph node).

An anterior resection specimen 270x25mm with mesocolon up to 90mm. The distal 15mm of the specimen is below the anterior peritoneal reflection.  Attached is grossly enlarged right ovary measuring 55x35x35mm and grossly enlarged left ovary 30x25x25mm with adherent fallopian tube 35x10mm.  Peritoneal strips are identified attached to the left ovary measuring 190x90x10mm.  The serosal surfaces have multiple mucinous deposits and scattered areas of haemorrhage.  Both ovaries are cystically dilated with multilocular cysts filled with mucinous material.  No intraluminal polyps or tumour are identified.

(7 proximal margin; 8 distal margin;  9 serosal involvement mucin; 10-12 right ovary [block 12 tumour block for tissue banking]; 13&amp;amp;14 left ovary; 15 ? four lymph nodes)

A gallbladder 60x20mm. The outer surface has focal ragged areas with no definite mucin.  Mucinous deposits are identified. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosal surfaces are green, granular with occasional yellow flecking.  No calculi are identified.

(16 cystic duct and TS neck; 17 TS body and LS fundus)

A spleen 155g measuring 120x80x35mm. The outer surface has focal cystic area 10x10mm.  Irregularity at periphery of the capsule is seen.  The cut surface is spongy red, no discrete lesions are identified.  The cyst is filled with blood clots.

(18 irregular capsule; 19 haematoma [haemorrhagic cyst)

A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring 330x170x25mm.  Focal ragged areas with possible mucinous deposits are identified occupying &amp;lt;5% of the total submitted omentum.

(20-22 ragged areas of omentum)

Received multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue including peritoneal strips measuring 180x120x25mm.  The serosal surfaces are ragged with occasional mucinous deposits.

(23&amp;amp;24 RS). RS (M-24/ZH 10/5/2070 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr G Luhring)
Sections from the appendiceal stump of the right hemicolectomy specimen show mucinous and serrated change of the residual appendiceal mucosa adjacent to the appendiceal orifice.  There is adjacent scar tissue and evidence of old haemorrhage.

Representative sections from the serosal deposits on the small and large bowel  show organising extracellular mucin. No mucinous epithelium is identified in the deposits. There are also scattered foci of endosalpingiosis involving the serosal aspect of the large bowel mesentery. Representative sections of bilateral ovaries show involvement by bilateral serous cyst adenofibroma. There is focal very mild epithelial proliferation. The appearances  fall well short of the designation of borderline mucinous cyst adenoma. There is no evidence of malignancy involving the ovary.

Sections of the gallbladder are unremarkable.

An area of haemorrhage forming a cystic process is identified within the spleen. The adjacent splenic parenchyma is unremarkable.

Representative sections of the omentum show scattered foci of endosalpingiosis. No mucin is identified.

Representative sections of the small and large bowel mucosa are unremarkable.

Seven benign reactive lymph nodes are sampled in the large bowel mesentery as well as within the omentum.

DIAGNOSIS:
ANTERIOR RESECTION, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, BILATERAL OVARIES, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM
- SCATTERED FOCI OF SEROSAL ORGANISING EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN, NO EPITHELIUM IDENTIFIED.
- BILATERAL SEROUS CYST ADENOFIBROMAS OF BOTH OVARIES.
- SCATTERED FOCI OF ENDOSALPINGIOSIS INVOLVING SEROSA AND OMENTUM.
- FOCAL SPLENIC HAEMORRHAGE.
- MUCINOUS AND SERRATED EPITHELIUM OF PROXIMAL APPENDIX ADJACENT TO APPENDICEAL ORIFICE.
