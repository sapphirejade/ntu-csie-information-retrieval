DR MATHEW RHYS KLITZNER
Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, HTP, increased cholesterol, BMI 40.  Frozen section, omentum.  67yr old female with pelvic mass - TAH BSO, omentectomy, debulking.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 60 x 55 x 15mm.  The cut surfaces show firm cream streaks of tissue through the majority of the specimen.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 & 4 - further sections.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  
Result to Dr Sang by Dr N Celius, Dr N Joganic, Dr N Raebel at 2:14pm on 18/02/65.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 51g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 75 x 45 x 30mm.  The ectocervix is 15 x 12mm.The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometrium is up to 14mm thick, with no focal lesions.  The uterine serosa appears diffusely dull with granular deposits, predominately over the anterior uterine body and fundus.  The left ovary is 15 x 8 x 8mm.  The left fallopian tube is 30mm in length.  Over the right cornu region there is adherent adipose tissue 40 x 35 x 15mm.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 7 - anterior uterine body with adherent fat; 8 - left ovary; 9 - left fallopian tube; 10 & 11 - adherent fat over right cornu region.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an ovary measuring 25 x 20 x 10mm with overlying fallopian tube 30mm inlength.  The serosal surfaces are predominately covered by a tan granular tumour.  RS 4 blocks.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 18 x 12 x 4mm.  One surface is covered by tan granular tissue.  TAE 1 block.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of two pieces of haemorrhagic greater omentum, 450 x 180 x 20mm and 105 x 60 x 25mm.  The majority of the omentum is involved by firm cream tumour deposits.  RS 3 blocks.  (JM/ta 19/2/65) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Tena):
A to E.  Sections show a poorlydifferentiated serous adenocarcinoma (high grade/grade 3) extensively involving all the sampled tissue.  The tumour involves omentum, serosa of uterus, outer half of myometrial wall, adnexal tissue, serosa of both ovaries, both fallopiantubes and pouch of Douglas peritoneum.  The tumour cells with high grade nuclei are arranged in solid nests and cords within desmoplastic stroma.  Papillary architecture and acinar formations are focally present.  Focally, the tumour also shows possible endometrial differentiation (grade 3).  The cervix is unremarkable.  The endometrium is atrophic and shows no significant abnormality.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  The tumour is incompletely excised.  In the right clinical setting, the overall appearances are consistent with those of a primary pelvic malignancy.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block D1)
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preservednuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The block best for molecular genetic testing is: D1

The case isshown to Dr N Shoaff.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Omentum - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
B.  Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
C.  Right tube and ovary - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
D.  Pouch of Douglas - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
E.  Omentum - Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.
