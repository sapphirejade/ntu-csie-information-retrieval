MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS WITH CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus, cervix attached tubes and ovaries, weighing 134g together.
Right tubes measure 40mm in length, 8mm in diameter. Serosa is smooth. There is a circumscribed encapsulated fatty lump (?lipoma) attached the fimbria, 25mm. Right ovary, 20x15x10mm. Sectioning is unremarkable.
Left tube measures 40mm in length, 10mm in diameter. Paratubal cyst is present. Left ovary measures 30x15x10mm. Sectioning is unremarkable.

Uterus measures 80x40x60mm. Ectocervix, 25x20mm, with a slit-like os, 10mm across. Ectocervix appears denuded. The anterior wall measures 30mm, posterior wall measures 32mm. Within posterior wall, there is a large creamy fairly circumscribed lobulated tumour with a depth of 30mm and it is 3mm from the serosal surface at closest. No definite infiltration to the cervix is present.

In the anterior wall, there are three intramuscular circumscribed white whorl nodule, 25,10 and 8mm.

(1-3 right fimbria and ?lipoma attached; 4 right tube; 5 right ovary; 6 and 7 left tube; 8 left ovary; 9 right parametrium; 10 left parametrium; 11-14 one full face anterior uterus; 14-18 more section of tumour; 19-21 section of anterior wall). RS (M-21) [Please see block diagram]

B. &amp;quot;APPENDICEAL EPIPLOICA&amp;quot;. Fibrofatty tissue, 10mm. AE (1-1)

C. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Fibrofatty tissue, 30mm, containing a lymph node, 10mm. RS (M-1)

D. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Fibrofatty tissue, 30mm, containing two lymph nodes, 20 and 10mm.

(1 first lymph node; 2 second lymph node). RS (M-2)

E. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. Fibrofatty tissue, 20mm. AE (1-1/SM 8/7/2071 cy)

Supplementary report:

Immunostains for MSI proteins (ANTENATAL WARD BELMONT HOSPITAL; block: A16)
MLH1: Positive (retained) nuclear staining.
PMS2: Positive (retained) nuclear staining.
MSH2: Positive (retained) nuclear staining.
MSH6: Positive (retained) nuclear staining.

Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.

Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
