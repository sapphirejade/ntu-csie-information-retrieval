CLINICAL NOTES:
Mesenteric lymph node fresh frozen section.  Redo peritonectomy + HIPEC for mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma
Keloid scar, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  One firm 10mm lymph node.  One TS for frozen section.

Frozen section result:  &amp;quot;No evidence of metastatic malignancy&amp;quot;.  Result to Dr Oliver (Registrar) at 10am, Q Arriola.  (Portion triaged for flow)

(1 frozen section;  2 remainder of lymph node; 3 remainder of tissue).  AE (M-3)

B.  &amp;quot;KELOID SCAR&amp;quot;.  Irregular fibrofatty tissue with overlying skin 25x15x10mm.  The outer surface inked blue, serially sliced.

(1 three LS from one end; 2 three TS from middle; 3 two LS from other end).  AE (M-3)

C.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;   A circumscribed fibrofatty nodule 25x20x15mm.  The outer surface inked blue.  Sectioning shows cystic wall with 1mm lining filled with mucin. AE (M-3/SM 2/5/2068 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr Q Swab)
A.  The sections show lymph node with reactive changes.  Negative for malignancy.
B.  The sections show skin with underlying dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is unremarkable.  In the dermis, there is prominent fibroblastic reaction and collagen consistent with hypertrophic scar/keloid.
C.  The sections show fatty tissue in which there is a cystic space lined by dense collagenised fibrous connective tissue wall and with a lining of columnar mucinous epithelium that in several areas shows multilayering and tufting. There is generally low grade nuclear cytology.
Comment : The appearances of specimen C are consistent with a low grade mucinous tumour including recurrent mucinous appendiceal tumour.  Correlation with previous pathology is recommended.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
B.  SKIN - KELOID SCAR.
C.  PERITONEAL DISEASE - LOW GRADE MUCINOUS TUMOUR - SEE TEXT.
