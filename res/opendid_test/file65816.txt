CLINICAL NOTES:
Recurrent left breast ca. Left sentinel lymph node for frozen section. Recurrent L breast Ca 3 o&amp;apos;clock with inflammatory component post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, left mastectomy suture = 12 o&amp;apos;clock.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. A 45mm piece of fatty tissue. Four lymph nodes identified. All unstained. Lymph node 1, 5mm bisected and half embedded for frozen section. Lymph node 2 is 7mm across. Bisected and half embedded for frozen section. Lymph node 3 is 10mm, is serially sectioned and one transverse section for frozen section. Lymph node 4 is 13mm across, serially sectioned and one transverse section embedded for frozen section.

F/S: &amp;quot;Negative (three lymph nodes seen)&amp;quot;. Results were given by phone to Dr. Augustus at 5:50pm on 11/05/2069 by Dr. L. Favuzza.

The remaining lymph node tissue is embedded.
(1  frozen section; 2  lymph node 1; 3  lymph node 2; 4  lymph node 3; 5  lymph node 4). Representative Sections (M-5).

MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard: Anterior Superior blue, Anterior Inferior green, Posterior black.
DISSECTION:  Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION:  In the 3 o&amp;apos;clock position, 15mm from the nipple is a 30x20x18mm firm tumour. The tumour has a lobular appearance with some focal haemorrhagic change. The tumour is deep to skin and is 65mm from the deep margin. In the lateral deep tissue is a soft yellow lesion (?lymph node) that is 20x9x12mm. This lesion is 1mm from the deep margin.The remaining cut surface is fibrofatty in appearance.
