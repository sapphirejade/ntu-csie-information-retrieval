FINDINGS / LESION:  Three separate lesions are identified
Lesion 1.  Extending from slice 4-6, measuring 12mm anterior to posterior, 12mm superior to inferior and 10mm medial to lateral.  The lesion is within 1mm of the superior margin, 6mm of medial, 12mm of inferior, 16mm of anterior, 30mm of lateral and well clear of the posterior margin by 40mm.
Lesion 2:  Extending from slice 8-14 (largest lesion) measuring 32mm medial to lateral, 28mm anterior to posterior, 23mm superior to inferior.  This lesion abuts the inferior and medial margins macroscopically and is located 7mm from the superior, 2mm of lateral, 8mm of posterior and 32mm of anterior margin.  It is separate from lesion 1 by slice 7 (4mm).
Lesion 3:  Extending from slice 9-10 measuring 10mm medial to lateral by 8x6mm. It abuts the superior margin, and well clear of the other margins by 15mm.  It is located 5mm of lesion 2.

RS (M-27 [Please see block diagram])
B.  &amp;quot;AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION RIGHT&amp;quot;.  Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring 110x70x40mm.  Multiple lymph nodes identified.  The largest lymph node measures 32x28x15mm and is totally effaced by firm white deposit.
(1 one lymph node serially sliced; 2 five lymph nodes; 3 one lymph node five TS; 4 one lymph node six TS;  5 one lymph node five TS; 6 one lymph node trisected; 7 RS largest involved lymph node; 8 one lymph node four TS; 9 one lymph node bisected; 10 one lymph node serially sliced; 11 ?four lymph nodes).
