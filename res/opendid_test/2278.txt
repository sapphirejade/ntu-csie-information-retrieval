HISTORY:
GI endometrial ca. Peritoneal washings, uterus, tubes and ovaries, omental biopsy, Pouch of Douglas. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "UTERUS WITH CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES". A uterus with cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. The uterus with cervix measures 60x40x25mm. The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with diameter up to 4mm. The right ovary measures 25x15x10mm. The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with diameter up to 5mm. The left ovary measures 25x15x11mm. The specimen is sectioned longitudinally. The endometrium measures about 2mm in thickness. The myometrium measures up to 15mm in thickness. There is polypoid structure arising 30mm in maximum extent. The endometrium within the anterior body of the uterus looks thickened 25mm. The whole specimen weighs 65g. 
(1-6 full face section of the LS of the uterus with cervix; 7 further section of the anterior body of the uterus; 8 sectionof the posterior fundus of the uterus; 9 right fimbrial end; 10 right fallopian tube; 11 right ovary; 12 right parietal tissue; 13 left fimbrial end; 14 left fallopian tube; 15 left ovary; 16 left parametrial tissue). 
B. "POUCH OF DOUGLAS'. One piece of fibrous tissue measuring 5mm in maximum extent. AE (1-1).
C. "OMENTUM". A piece of fatty tissue measuring 45x20x10mm. There are no obvious lesions identified within the omentum. AE(M-4/BE/th)
