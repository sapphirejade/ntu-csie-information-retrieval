CLINICAL:
Carcinosarcoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 639g in total.  The uterus measures 150 x 130 x 85mm and has a haemorrhagic nodular surface with areas of exposed tumour especially over the anterior uterine surface.  The ectocervix measures 45 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is approximately 5mm in thickness and the myometrium is up to 52mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains tumour which appears full thickness through the exposed serosal surface.  The tumour is mostly anterior and is approximately 20mm from the cervical os and 2mm from the cervical soft tissue margin.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - LS of lower uterine segment and cervix; 4 - tumour anteriorly; 5 & 6, 7 & 8 - posterior cervix and endocervical canal; 9 to 11 - anterior endometrium and tumour; 12 to 14 - tumour and anterior serosal surface; 15 - representative tumour; 16 - tumour for Bio Bank.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 55mm in length x 8 x 8mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is haemorrhagic.  The attached ovary measures 32 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - fallopian tube; 3 to 5 - ovary (70% of ovary embedded).
C.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary and tube" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 35mm in length x 7 x 7mm in diameter.  There is an attached ovary measuring 30 x 15 x 8mm.  The ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  There is a haemorrhagic nodule within the adnexal soft tissue measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.
Blocks: 1 - fallopian tube and haemorrhagic nodule; 2 - fallopian tube; 3 to 5 - ovary (70% of ovary embedded).
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac node" consists of a lymph node measuring 50 x 20 x 15mm.  The lymph node has a firm cut surface with areas of necrosis.  There are two fragments of tissue measuring 5 and 10mm which included with the specimen as well as a piece of blood clot measuring 50mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative from enlarged lymph node; 3 - two fragments andclot.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 8 x 5mm containing a lymph node measuring 20mm in maximum dimension.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 2 blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 65 x 25 x 18mm.  Lymph nodes are found measuring from 5 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  The largest appears replaced by tumour.  The lymph nodes are AE.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative involved lymph node; 3 to 6 - possible lymph nodes as seen.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac node" consists of a tan nodule measuring 45 x 25 x 20mm.  The cut surface shows a firm tan cut surface with areas of haemorrhage and possible necrosis.  Representative in 2 blocks.
H.  Specimen labelled "Aorta cava node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 55 x 25 x 15mm.  The lymph nodes are identified ranging from 12 to 20mm in maximum dimension.  AE.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 & 3 - one lymph node; 4 - one lymph node.
I.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 23 x 70 x 15mm.  No nodules are found within the fibrofatty tissue.  Representative in 3 blocks.  (ZG/rt 20.8.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Hesch):
A.  Sections of uterus show extensive involvement by a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma.  The tumour cells are arranged in solid sheets and nests with large areas of necrosis.  The tumour cells show round to oval nuclei and moderate amount of cytoplasm.  Majority of tumour cells have vesicular chromatin with small or inconspicuous nucleoli.  No glandular formations or serous adenocarcinoma features are seen.  No sarcomatoid areas are seen.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin), CD56 and Chromogranin.  There is focal moderate staining for Synaptophysin and NSE.  The stains for ER, PR, CK7, CK20, S100, p53 and WT-1 are negative.  The overall appearances are those of poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.  The tumour involves the full thickness of myometrial wall (52mm).  The serosal surface of uterus is focally involved by the tumour (block A13).  The tumour extends into the cervical stroma (block A7).  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion.  The endometriumaway from the tumour is atrophic.  The tumour is clear of the cervical resection margin.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B & C.  Sections show normal appearing bilateral ovaries with no significant abnormality.  Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One(1) lymph node is identified.  The entire lymph node is involved by metastatic carcinoma.
E.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is involved by metastatic carcinoma.
F.  Eight (8) lymph nodes are identified.  1 of 8 lymph nodes is involved by metastatic carcinoma.
G.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The entire lymph node is involved by metastatic carcinoma.
H.  Three (3) lymph nodes are identified.  1 of 3lymph nodes is involved by metastatic carcinoma.
I.  Sections show normal appearing adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus and cervix - Poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
B.  Right tube and ovary - No significant abnormality.
C.  Left ovary and tube - No significant abnormality.
D.  Right common iliac node - Metastatic carcinoma (1/1).
E.  Left common iliac node - Metastatic carcinoma (1/1).
F.  Right obturator node - Metastatic carcinoma (1/8).
G.  Left external iliac node - Metastatic carcinoma (1/1).
H.  Aorta cava node - Metastatic carcinoma (1/3).
I.  Omental biopsy - No significant abnormality.
