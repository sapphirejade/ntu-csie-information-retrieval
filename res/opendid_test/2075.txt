HISTORY:  
Recurrent colorectal cancer.  Left distal ureter. Retroperitoneal tumour.  Omentum.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "PERITONEAL TUMOUR, OMENTUM".  Multiple pieces of peritoneum with adherent omentum, measuring in aggregate 100x100x80mm.  The peritoneal surface shows some firm puckered areas and on sectioning shows some gelatinous nodules of ? tumour.  Some skeletal muscle is present. Suspicious areas have been sampled.
(1-8 RS).  RS (M-8)
B.  "LEFT URETER ? TUMOUR". An unorientated tubular structure with lumen measuring 20mm in length and up to 4mm in diameter. The external surface has some rough areas.  One resection margin inked red, the opposing resection margin inked blue.  The specimen is unorientated.  Specimen transversely sectioned.  
(1 TS; 2 two TS resection margin).  AE (M-2/ED/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (F. Ballmann)
A.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue in which there are multiple cystically dilated spaces lined by multinucleated histiocytes and macrophages in keeping with foreign body reaction. Changes of fat necrosis are identified. Focally, deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma showing extensive necrosis in keeping with colorectal origin are noted surrounded by fibrous scarring. A segment of vas deferens is identified. 
B.  Sections show ureter.No evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  PERITONEAL TUMOUR, OMENTUM - 
 - ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.
