HISTORY:  
CRC with mets.Small bowel.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
"SMALL BOWEL".  A length of small bowel measuring 65mm in length and up to 35mm in maximum diameter.  Mesoappendix is attached along thespecimen to a maximum width of 15mm.  The serosal surface includes areas of irregularity at mid specimen measuring 25x10mm.  The cut surface of the area of irregularity reveals firm white and possibly mucinous cut surface.  The mucosa isunremarkable.  This area of irregularity is located 20mm from the nearest resection margin.  
(1 LS peripheral resection margin near the nodule; 2 LS other resection margin; 3 two LS across mesentery; 4&5 TS of bowel with nodular area; 6 reserve block for tissue banking).  RS (M-6/GV/nh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (X. Fragnoli)
Sections through the small bowel show metastatic poorly differentiatedsignet ring adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous differentiation involving the serosa and outer layer of muscularis propria.  No mucosal abnormalities are seen.  The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesions.  A single lymph node identified in the mesentery shows reactive changes.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
SMALL BOWEL: -
- METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SIGNET RING ADENOCARCINOMA
