CLINICAL NOTES:
R breast sentinel node frozen section, right breast Ca, long-lateral, medium-medial, short-superior.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SENTINEL NODE RIGHT BREAST&amp;quot;.  One pale blue lymph node 20x6x5mm.  Half embedded for frozen section.  One tan lymph node 4mm in maximum diameter.  The blue node was sampled for frozen section.

F/S:  &amp;quot;No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot;.  Result was phoned on 14.6.2071 by Dr. Q. Parat.

(1  frozen; 2  remainder of blue node; 3  smaller tan node [not frozen]).  RS (M-3).

B.  &amp;quot;LESION RIGHT BREAST&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Short - superior, Medium - medial, Long - lateral.&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE:  Right
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Wide local excision, oriented.
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  Yes, hookwire split is identified in G7 adjacent to a possible density in F7.
HOOKWIRE:  Yes, entering the specimen anteromedially.
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  55mm
Superior to inferior:  33mm
Anterior to posterior:  20mm
WEIGHT:  16g
SKIN:  No
NIPPLE:  No
MUSCLE:  No
MARGIN INKED:  Standard:  Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from lateral to medial
Number of slices:  10
FINDINGS / LESION:  The yellow inking is present in slices 3 and 4.  It is corresponding to a lesion with firm white cut surface and infiltrative borders measuring 11mm superior to inferior x8x8mm.  This lesion is located 12mm of anterior, 3mm of posterior, 10mm of superior, 10mm of inferior, 12mm of medial, and 25mm of lateral margin macroscopically.
Another ill-defined firm area is present in slices 6 and 7 measuring 8x6x4mm.  It is abutting the posterior margin macroscopically, located 4mm of superior, 8mm of inferior, and more than 20mm of other margins.  The specimen becomes haemorrhagic towards the lateral aspect of the specimen.
