HISTORY:  
PMP. Left upper quadrant mucus, diaphragm, tail pancreas. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
"DIAPHRAGMATIC TUMOUR". A piece of diaphragm with attachedfatty tissue and nodule peripancreatic tail measuring 110x80x30mm. There is some mucus separate in the specimen container measuring in aggregate 30x30x20mm. The area of ?pancreatic tail is inked blue. On sectioning the ?pancreatic tail is pale and underlying there is mucinous ?tumour deposits with disc like spaces and fibrous tissue. 
(1&2 free mucus; 3&4 paired ?pancreatic tissue; 5-8 representative diaphragmatic tumour deposit). RS (M-8/ZG/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr R Kurylo)
Sections show low grade mucinous neoplasm comprising of atypical mucinous epithelium associated with extracellular lakes of mucin.  The tumour is seen to involve dense fibrous tissue presumably arising from diaphragm and is also seen attached to peripancreatic soft tissues.  No direct extension into pancreatic parenchyma is seen.  No desmoplastic destructive tumour invasion is identified.  
Comment : The appearances arein keeping with low grade mucinous neoplasm resulting in pseudomyxoma peritonei.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
DIAPHRAGMATIC TUMOUR : 
-LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM INVOLVING DIAPHRAGM AND PERIPANCREATIC TISSUES.
