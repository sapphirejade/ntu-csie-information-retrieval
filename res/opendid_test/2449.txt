HISTORY:  
DPAM.
Dissimilated peritoneal adenomucinosis deposits.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"PERITONEAL DISEASE". Consists of a segmentof bowel and three pieces of tissue, probably representing peritoneum with deposit of mucinous tumour. The segment of bowel measures 60mm in length with circumference up to 60mm. The serosal of the bowel appears fibrotic in places, but there are no obvious depositions of serosal tumour identified. There are multiple areas with thickened walls identified within the segment of bowel. There are two possible mesenteric lymph nodes identified, measuring 4 & 6mm. Representative sections are taken and embedded. 
 
(1 marginone; 2 margin two; 3&4 representative sections, transverse sections of the bowel; 5 two lymph nodes).
There are multiple fibrofatty piece of tissue identified in the container, measuring 70x65x25mm which contain deposits of mucinous tumour. Representative sections are taken and embedded in five blocks.
(6-10 representative sections of the smaller pieces of tissue with possible tumour deposit). RS (M-10/QO/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. A. Surguy)
Histology shows deposit of low-grade mucinous neoplasm found within fatty peritoneal tissue which are characterised by peripherally sited strips of mucinous epithelium with low-grade cytological atypia. No such deposits are seen over the serosal aspect of the small bowel and colon which show mild serosal fibrosis within places some adherent skeletal muscle. No malignancy is seen in two local lymph nodes. No evidence of high-grade frankly malignant adenocarcinoma are seen. The appearances are consistent with peritoneal involvementof a presumed appendiceal primary low-grade mucinous neoplasm. Correlation with the clinical and previous histology findings is, however, recommended. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
PERITONEAL DISEASE
- INVOLVED BY LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
