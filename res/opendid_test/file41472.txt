CLINICAL NOTES:
Redo-peritonectomy - Colon AdenoCa. Recurrence at post-drain sites.
- RIF lesion
- RIF port site lesion - suture marking lesion
- Gallbladder.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;RIGHT ILIAC CREST LESION&amp;quot;. Consists of fibrofatty tissue, measuring 50x50x30mm. One side of the specimen is flat and contains fatty (half of the surface). The other side is irregular, ragged and convex. Convex surface is inked black, and flat surface is inked blue. Serially sliced into 8 sections. Sectioning shows fibrofatty muscular section. There is a creamy possible mucinous lesion, measuring 20x20x15mm. It is 1mm from black margin and 2mm from blue margin at closest.

(1 LS from Slice 1; 2 Slice 2; 3 Slice 3; 4 Slice 4; 5 and 6 Slice 5). RS (6-6)

B. &amp;quot;RIF PORT SITE STITCH MARK AT LESION&amp;quot;. Two pieces of fibrofatty tissue present in the same jar.
One irregular piece, weighing 17g, and measuring 65x40x30mm, with stitch marking the lesion. Flat surface is inked blue and concave, surface is inked black. Serially sliced. On sectioning at the marked area, there is an irregular ill-defined firm, white lesion, measuring 15x10x10mm. It is 1mm from blue margin at closest and 2mm from black margin at closest. The lesion embedded entirely in Blocks 1-4.

The second specimen is oval, 47x40x12mm. One surface is inked blue, the other surface is inked black. Serially sliced. Sectioning shows homogenous fatty tissue. No lesions identified.

(1-4 first specimen with the lesion]; 5-7 representative section of the second rounded specimen). RS (M-7)

C. &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER&amp;quot;. Intact gallbladder, 95x30x35mm. Serosa is smooth and pale. No obvious tumour deposits are identified macroscopically. It contains multiple lobulated yellow calculus,8mm on average. Wall thickness measures up to 3mm. Mucosa is velvety. No tumours or polyps present macroscopically.

(1 cystic duct/margin [after removal of staple section]; 2 neck; 3 body; 4 fundus). RS (M-4/SM 27/2/2070 cy)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. D Liburd)
A.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue including muscle in which there is an infiltrating moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The tumour is comprised of large mucin pools within which strips of mucin secreting epithelium are noted.  Focally, the tumour is 0.5mm from the soft tissue margin.
B.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue in which there is a focus of moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma, similar to those seen in specimen A.  The tumour is 5mm from the closest soft tissue margin.
C.  Sections of gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis and vascular congestion.  No evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  RIGHT ILIAC CREST LESION:  MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA
B.  RIF PORT SITE  -   MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA
C.  GALLBLADDER  -  MILD CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS
