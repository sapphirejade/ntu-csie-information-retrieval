CLINICAL NOTES:
Right hemicolectomy, rectum, spleen, gallbladder, omentum, peritoneum.  Appendix tumour (PMP).

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, RECTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, BILATERAL DIAPHRAGMATIC, PERITONEAL DISEASE/OMENTUM&amp;quot;.  Received in one jar multiple tissue fragments with confluent involvement by serosal mucinous deposit, including :

A right hemicolectomy specimen consists of terminal ileum 75x30mm, caecum and ascending colon 125x75mm, mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of 85mm.  Peritoneal strips are identified 130x75x5mm.  There is a confluent involvement of the serosal surfaces by mucinous deposits. No appendix is identified. At the anatomical site of the appendix there is fibrous tissue covered by mucin 17x15x10mm.  The cut surface of this area reveals multiple stitches with surrounding mucinous deposits. Within the remainder bowel, three polyps are identified;  an ascending colon polyp 8mm located 70mm of the proximal margin and two ascending colon polyps 5 and 6mm located 40mm and 15mm of the distal margin.

(1 proximal and distal margins; 2 proximal polyp bisected; 3 two distal polyps; 4-6 appendiceal orifice site with fibrous mass ; 7 small bowel serosa; 8 peritoneal strip and large bowel serosa; 9&amp;amp;10 each five lymph nodes)

An anterior resection specimen including sigmoid and upper rectum 85mm in length and 35mm in diameter with attached mesocolon up to 45mm. There is an attached peritoneal strip 225x100mm.  At its tip there is an umbilicus 40x15mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 40mm.  There are multiple mucinous deposits including the serosal surfaces and the mesentery.  It is forming a mass proximal specimen measuring 75x25x20mm with multiloculated mucinous cut surface.  The serosal deep edge of the umbilicus is ragged and haemorrhagic.  The bowel mucosa is smooth.  No polyps or tumours are identified.

(11 proximal and distal margins; 12 umbilicus; 13 bowel wall; 14 peritoneal strips; 15&amp;amp;16 proximal mass with block 16 block for tissue banking).

A gallbladder 65x30mm with attached pieces of peritoneum that is extensively involved by mucinous deposits up to 35mm thick.  The gallbladder wall is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces are green and granula.  No calculi are identified.

(17 shave of resection and TS neck; 18 TS body)

A spleen, 297g, 125x85x50mm attached to piece of peritoneal strips and omentum 275x135x20mm.  The splenic overlying capsule is extensively involved by mucinous deposits abutting the underlying parenchyma.  Similar deposits are identified on the other peritoneal and omental surfaces.

(19 splenic involvement; 20 omentum)

Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue consistent with diaphragmatic strips and pieces of peritoneum measuring 270x210x50mm in aggregate.  There is disseminated involvement with multiple mucinous deposits.

(21 diaphragmatic strips). RS (M-21/ZH 26/7/2067 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr T Lattus)
The sections of the right hemicolectomy specimen demonstrate abundant excellular mucin pools in the region of the appendix with fibrous organisation and with similar mucin deposits seen on the serosal surfaces of the small bowel and the adjacent large bowel. Focally, strips of atypical columnar mucinous epithelium with low nuclear grade features are seen in the mucin pools at the appendix site and small bowel serosa (Blocks 6&amp;amp;7).

A tubulovillous adenoma and serrated adenomas are seen in the colon. The remainder of the colonic and small intestinal mucosae appear unremarkable. The surgical margins appear unremarkable. 10 lymph nodes have been identified and show reactive changes only.

Sections of the rectosigmoid colon show normal appearing mucosa. On the serosal surfaces, including in the adjacent mucinous mass and along the peritoneal surface of the umbilicus there is abundant extracellular mucus including columnar mucinous epithelium that in some areas show multi-layering and very occasional mitoses with an overall low nuclear grade. The resection margins are unremarkable.

Sections of the gallbladder show serosal extracellular mucous associated with a strip of columnar low-grade mucinous epithelium.

Section of the spleen show normal splenic parenchyma with serosal organising acellular mucous.

Sections of the separate piece of fibrofatty tissue show organising extracellular mucous with associated low-grade mucinous epithelium.

Comment: There is peritoneal mucus with associated low-grade mucinous epithelium. The appearances are consistent with low-grade pseudomyxoma peritonei (low-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei - PSOGI System). Correlation with clinical features and previous pathology is recommended.
