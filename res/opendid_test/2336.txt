MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Lovitz):
Sections show an endometrial polyp with complex hyperplasia with cytological atypia.
In addition, on the surface of the polyp focally and in separate scanty fragments are crowded atypical glands with extensive mucinous and eosinophilic metaplasia.  These are suspicious of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
