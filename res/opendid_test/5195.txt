CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes, ovaries, cervix" consists of uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries received previously opened andin formalin.  The specimen is 139g.  The uterus with cervix is 90 x 60 x 50mm.  The ectocervix is 35 x 35mm.  The entire endometrial cavity is filled by an exophytic polypoid tumour, 55 x 30 x 30mm.  No definite myometrial invasion is seen.  The myometrium is up to 25mm thick.  There is a 14mm intramural fibroid.  The left ovary is 15 x 15 x 12mm and the left fallopian tube is 45mm in length.  The right ovary is 30 x 20 x 15mm and the right fallopian tube is 55mm in length.  
Blocks:  1 to 6 - full longitudinal section anterior body and cervix; 7 to 11 - full longitudinal section posterior body and cervix; 12 & 13 - paired section tumour with fibroid; 14 & 15 - paired section tumour; 16 - left ovary and fallopian tube; 17 - right ovary and fallopian tube.  
Blocks 18 to 33:  remainder of endometrial cavity embedded.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 90 x 50 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 30mm across.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - largest lymph node; 4 to 6- multiple lymph nodes.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 80 x 50 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 45mm across.  
Blocks:  1 to 3- largest lymph node; 4 & 5 - one lymph node; 6 - multiple lymph nodes.  (TO: JR:  LC/mm 3.9.65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr K Killary)
A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a non-invasive FIGO grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (carcinoma in situ). The adenocarcinoma consists of foci of complex, crowded glands with minimal intervening stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGA architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 1 = overall grade 1). There is focal extension of along adenomyosis. No lymphovascular space invasion, myometrial invasion or serosal involvement is seen. The myometrium contains scattered leiomyomas. The cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality. 
B.  Sections of the twelve right pelvic lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/12). 
C.  Sections of the six left pelvic lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/6).
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries: 
Non-invasive, FIGO Grade 1, endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. 
Leiomyomas and focal adenomyosis.
Cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality. 

B.  Rightpelvic lymph nodes: No evidence of malignancy in twelve lymph nodes (0/12). 

C.  Left pelvic lymph nodes: No evidence of malignancy in six lymph nodes(0/6).
