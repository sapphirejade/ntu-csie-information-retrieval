CLINICAL:
Descending colon tumour.  Splenic flexure.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Descending colon + sigmoid" and consists of a segment of colon measuring 270mm in length with attached fatty tissue up to 85mm across.  50mm from the closest margin there is solid tumour with a slightly depressed centre measuring 28 x 20 x 4mm.  The tumour is 165mm from the other resection margin.  The tumour is centred on the mesenteric side of the colon.  The tumour appears to be infiltrating the muscularis propria.  
Blocks: 1 - the margin closer to the tumour; 2 - the margin further away from the tumour 3 & 4 - (paired sections) TS of tumour; 5 - TS tumour (reserve block); 6 - LS tumour and adjacent normal looking mucosa; 7 - TS tumour; 8 - ?apical lymph node; 9 & 10 - lymph nodes as seen; 11 - one lymph node; 12 to 14 - sections of fat looking for lymph nodes; 15 - ?lymph nodes as seen.   (TO: OG; DN/ta 2/6/65) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Chumley and Dr E Emert): 

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumourinvolvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: 12	
Number of lymph nodes involved: 0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
No other significant abnormality identified.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preservednuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
