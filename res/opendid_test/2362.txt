Right hemicolectomy.
Gallbladder.
Right diaphragm strip.
Pelvic strip right.
Common hepatic artery lymph node.
 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "? TUMOUR ABDOMINAL WALL".  Piece of fatty tissue measuring 20mm in diameter with a firm nodule measuring 5mm in diameter.
F/S : "Mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells".  Reported to anaesthetist by Dr. I. Aloi at 3.10pm on 13.01.65.
(1 FS; 2&3 remainder of the specimen).  AE (M-3)
B.  "GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIP, RIGHT PELVIC STRIP".  Loop of bowel with anastomosis of the smalland large bowel measuring in length 350mm.  With the length of the small bowel being 140mm and length of the large bowel being about 200mm.  The circumference of the small bowel is up to 50mm and the circumference of the larger bowel isup to 100mm.  The serosal surface of the small and large bowels look ragged.  However, there are no obvious deposits of tumour identified on the serosal surface.  There is large nodular lesion identified within the mesentery measuring 30x20x20mm.  On the section this lesion appears with a cut section and is mucoid. It is probably a lymph node invaded by the tumour.  There is one more possible small deposition of tumour found on the serosal surface of the mesentery whichmeasures about 3mm in diameter.  Representative sections are taken and embedded. 
(1 LS of proximal surgical margin; 2 LS of distal surgical margin; 3&4 RS of the serosa of the small bowel; 5 RS of the large bowel through theragged surfaces; 6 section of the small mesenteric nodule; 7 section through the large mesenteric nodule)
There is gallbladder measuring 80x32x30mm.  The serosa of the gallbladder looks smooth and shiny. The gallbladder contain viscous bile.  No stones identified.  The mucosa is velvety.  Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(8 proximal surgical margin; 9 sections through the body of the gallbladder transverse; 10 LS of the fundus).  
The omentum measures 440x170x15mm. There are few nodular deposits identified within the omentum measuring from 5 up to 10mm in maximal extent.  Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(11-13 RS of the omentumwith nodular lesion).  
There are also multiple pieces of tissue identified in the containing measuring in aggregate 170x170x70mm. There are no obvious depositions of tumour found within this piece of tissue.  Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(14-18 RS of the fibrous piece of tissue).  RS (M-18)
C.  "COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE".  One piece of tissue measuring 10mm in maximal extent. The specimen is sectioned transversely and all embedded in one block.  AE (M-1/VC/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (I. Goda)
A.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue infiltrated by poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with areas of signet ring differentiation.
B.  Sections show poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring differentiation involving serosa of small and largebowel and omentum.  The small bowel mucosa and wall and colonic mucosa and wall show no focal lesion.  The proximal and distal surgical margins of resection are clear of tumour.  
Sections through the gallbladder show changes of chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis with no evidence of tumour.  
Sections through the separately submitted fragments of tissue show skeletal muscle and fibrous tissue with foreign body granulomatous reaction and noevidence of tumour.  
C.  Sections show a lymph node with scattered lipogranulomas.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
TUMOUR ABDOMINAL WALL :
-METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING DIFFERENTIATION.  
GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIP, RIGHT PELVIC STRIP :
-METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING DIFFERENTIATION INVOLVING SEROSA OF SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL AND OMENTUM.  
- NO TUMOUR SEEN IN GALLBLADDER AND SEPARATELY SUBMITTED FIBROUS AND SKELETAL MUSCLE TISSUES.
COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE:  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
