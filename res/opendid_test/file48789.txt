B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Segment four + five liver edge resection&amp;quot;, consists of a wedge resection of liver weighing 45 grams and measuring 75 x 50 x 36mm.  The capsule appears tan and uniform.  On sectioning there are two discrete well circumscribed tumours measuring 10 and 21mm in maximum dimension.  The smaller tumour measures 16mm from the parenchyma resection margin and abuts the capsular margin.  The larger tumour measures from the parenchyma margin and is located 1mm from the capsular surface.  Blocks: 1 - smaller nodule with closest parenchymal margin; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - composite sections, through larger tumour with closest parenchymal margin; 4 - liver away from tumours.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Segment 6 &amp;amp; 7 liver resection&amp;quot;, consists of a wedge resection of liver weighing 295g and measuring 125 x 85 x 72mm.  The capsule shows two areas of puckering and pallor measuring 17 and 37mm maximum dimension.  On sectioning there are four tumour deposits ranging in size from 15 to 47mm in maximum dimension.  Two of the smaller deposits abut the parenchymal resection margin.  Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - tumour deposits with abutting parenchymal resection margin; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - sections from largest deposit with parenchymal and capsular margin; 5 - small subcapsular deposit.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Coeliac lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of consists of two lymph nodes with attached fat measuring 50 x 25 x 10mm in total.  Blocks: 1 - smaller node bisected; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - larger nodes serially sliced.  AE.   (TO:AP/ta 10/5/70)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Greenough):
A. Sections show a 60mm pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, grade 2. The lesion is composed of nests and sheets of tumour cells with predominantly uniform round nuclei and fine chromatin. Scattered larger tumour cells with prominent nucleoli are seen. Tumour with glandular and trabecular architecture is also present. There are up to 10 mitoses per 10 hpf.
There is extensive, multifocal lymphatic and venous invasion. Extensive tumour is seen in the splenic vein. The lesion focally surrounds the circumference of the splenic artery (A28), however no invasion into the wall of the artery is seen.
The shave margin of the splenic vein margin (A4) has been cut to extinction across multiple levels. Tumour is seen in the lumen of the vessel at the deepest level, and involvement of this margin cannot be excluded.
Multifocal perineural invasion is also present.
The spleen is unremarkable. There is no evidence of malignancy.
Metastatic tumour is present in 1 out of 26 lymph nodes.

PATHOLOGICAL STAGING (AJCC 8th Ed.)

Primary tumour category (pT)
T3		Tumour limited to the pancreas, &amp;gt;4 cm

Regional lymph node category (pN)
N1		Regional lymph node involvement

Distant metastasis category (pM)
M1 		Distant metastasis (to liver, specimens B and C)
