HISTORY:
Serosal tumour infiltration. 
?nodal spread left para-ovarian tissue.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. 'UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT + RIGHT OVARIES, LEFT + RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBES'. A uterus with attached both fallopian tubes andboth ovaries total specimen weight 175 g. The uterus measures up to 60mm from medial to lateral, 90mm from fundus to cervix, and 35mm from anterior to posterior. At the fundus and extending to left side near left tube, there is a pale area of visible tumour just deep to the serosal surface with puckering measuring about 40 mm in extent. 
Left fallopian tube: 80mm in length, 7mm external diameter. 
Left ovary: 30x15x8 mm. 
Right fallopian tube: 70mmin length, 7mm in external diameter. 
Right ovary: 30x15x8mm. 
Anterior cervix blue posterior black. 
In the body and fundus there is a pale solid invasive tumour involving anterior and posterior uterine wall measuring 38mm anterior to posterior, 50 mm right to left and 50mm from superior to inferior. There is focal central necrosis. The endometrial lumen is largely  obliterated by tumour. The tumour involves right and left cornua.  Tumour extendson the left side through the myometrium into paratubal tissue between tube and round ligament. 
Anterior myometrial wall invasion: 14 mm through thickness 15 mm
Posterior myometrial wall invasion: 20 mm through thickness 21 mm
The tumour extends to lower uterine segment but does not involve endocervix and is 30 mm from the distal margins. Tumour is 5 mm from parametrial margins.
(1 right LS and TS fallopian tube including fimbrial end; 2 representative right ovary LS. 3 LS and TS left fallopian tube with fimbrial end; 4 representative LS left ovary; 5-8 anterior cervix to fundus [notches inferior]; 9-12 posterior cervix to fundus [notches inferior]; 13 left sidedpara-ovarian tissue with tumour; 14 left sided tumour at serosal surface; RS (M-14) Further: 15,16 posterior myometrium; 17 left parametrium; 18 lower uterine segment and tumour; EZ
B. 'RIGHT PELVIC NODE'. Multiple pieces offatty tissue, measuring in aggregate 20x20x20mm.  (1 three possible nodes; 2 one sectioned macroscopically involved node [15mm node]; 3 one sectioned node; 4 remaining fatty tissue). AE (M-4)
C. 'LEFT PELVIC NODE'. Multiple pieces of fatty tissue, measuring 15x15x10mm. One 15mm node identified.  (1 node section; 2 remaining tissue possible node). AE (M-2)
D. 'LEFT COMMON ILIAC NODE'. A node measuring 25x10x6mm.  (1and2 node transversely sectioned).AE (M-2)
E. 'OMENTUM'. A portion of omentum, measuring 40x40x10mm. No firm or suspicious area identified on inspection or sectioning. AE (M-3/ZG/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  
A. UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT + RIGHT OVARIES ANDTUBES:
There is a large invasive carcinoma in body and fundus of uterus. The carcinoma is endometrioid type, predominantly solid pattern with some small glandular areas. The tumour has a focal fibrous stroma but carcinosarcoma areas or stromal osteoid or chondroid differentiation are not present. The tumour expands the left cornu area forming a visible pale mass in this area, abutting L parovarian tissue, but appears still within thinned uterine wall in this area. Tumour extends focally to the serosal surface in this area. 
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA, UTERUS:
Histologic tumour type:  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Grade:  FIGO grade 3
Myometrial invasion: Present
Depthof invasion:  20 mm in depth
Myometrial thickness: 22 mm
% of myometrium invaded:  approximately 90 %
Lymphovascular invasion: Present, focal
Location of lymphovascular invasion: At tumour interface
Perineuralinvasion: present, focal, left parometrium
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Uterine peritoneal surface involvement:  Present, near left cornu
Excision margins:  Paracervical and parametrial margins are negative for tumour.
Other: 
Right fallopian tube: No signficant abnormality. 
Right ovary: No signficant abnormality.
Left fallopian tube: No signficant abnormality.
Left ovary:  No signficant abnormality.
Residual nontumour endometrium:  Atrophic
In situ carcinoma (serous intraepithelial carcinoma):  Absent
Ectocervix: unremarkable
Endocervix: Unremarkable
Other tests:  
Peritoneal washings (see cytology report 98M69652)
Immunostains:
Mismatch repair enzymes: Pending
Representative tumour: 
Immunostains A10, Reserve tissue A12

Number of nodes positive: 0
Total number of nodes examined: 8
C. LEFT PELVIC NODE: 
Lymph nodes not involved
Number of nodes positive: 0
Total number of nodes examined: 1
D. LEFT COMMON ILIAC NODE:
Lymph nodes notinvolved
Number of nodes positive: 0
Total number of nodes examined: 1
E. OMENTUM:
Sections of omentum show no tumour. There is focal mesothelial hyperplasia.
FIGO Stage (2008): 3A (tumour invadesthe serosa of the corpus uteri)

Supplementary report: (1)
Immunostains for DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) proteins (block: A13):
MLH1: loss of staining
PMS2: loss of staining
MSH2: loss of staining
MSH6: loss of staining
Comments: 
Immunohistochemistry of cancer tissues for mismatch repair proteins is a surrogate marker for MSI status, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result. Tumours that show loss of MMR proteins are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI-H).  Loss of MSH2, and MSH6 is quite strongly associated with Lynch syndrome. The above results show a 'null' pattern of Immunoreactivity which has been described inrare cases with combined abnormalities.
