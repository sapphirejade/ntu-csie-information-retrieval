HISTORY:  
Peritonectomy - appendix cancer. 
- Gallbladder, peritoneal nodule, right hemicolectomy, muscle R abdo wall.
- Pelvic disease. Frozen section.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "PELVIC DISEASE". History of appendix cancer. Two pieces of calcified tissue, 6mm and 4mm in diameter. Half of each for frozen section.
F/S: "Calcified debris and fibrous tissue, no evidence of malignancy" per phone by Dr. M. Rustad on 30/12/64.
(1 frozen section tissue; 2 remaining tissue). AE (M-2)
B. "RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM AND GALLBLADDER". A gallbladder measuring 90mm in length and 30mm in diameter. There is a smooth serosal surface. No cystic duct nodes present. On opening, thereis bile present and the mucosa shows diffuse cholesterolosis. 
(1 TS resection margin; 2 two TS body; 3 two LS fundus). 
Peritoneum. A portion of peritoneum with underlying skeletal muscle measuring 130x70mm to adepth of 30mm. The peritoneum is haemorrhagic. On sectioning, there is fibrous tissue and a ?pale firm area up to 10mm in maximal extent. 
(4-7 representative sections, pale firm area; 8,9&10 also further representative sections of peritoneum).
Right hemicolectomy with attached omentum. The attached omentum measures up to 300x200x30mm. No definite tumour deposit is identified in the omentum. 
(11-15 representative omentum).
right hemicolectomy measures up to 420mm in length including 160mm of terminal ileum. There is no appendix present. The serosal surface has some haemorrhagic rough areas ?adhesion around the caecum. The mesentery has some firm haemorrhagic areas ?tumour deposits on the serosal surface. On opening, the mucosa is unremarkable. There is no apical node identified. 
(16 mesenteric rough area; 17&18 serosal surface with ?tumour deposit; 19 LS resection margin; 20 representative small bowel and large bowel mucosa; 21 three possible nodes; 22 four possible nodes). RS (M-22/NN/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr M Dallago)  
A.  Sections show a calcified and ossified degenerate appendix epiploica.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections through the gallbladder show the features of chronic cholecystitis. Sections through the right hemicolectomy specimen show scattered serosal fibrous adhesions in the caecum. The appendix is not identified. The colonic and small bowel mucosa show no focal lesions. Local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes. The surgical margins of resection are clear of any lesions. 
Sections through the separately submitted peritoneal fragments show fibrosis with foreign body granulomatous reaction tosuture material. Sections through omentum show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
Comment: The absence of tumour deposits in the sections examined does not totally preclude presence of microscopic deposits of tumour that may not have been sampled.  

DIAGNOSIS:  
PELVIC DISEASE:  
 - CALCIFIED AND OSSIFIED DEGENERATE APPENDIX EPIPLOICAE.  NO TUMOUR SEEN. 
RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM AND GALLBLADDER: 
	FIBROSIS WITH FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMATOUS REACTION IN PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS. SCATTERED FIBROUS ADHESIONS ON CAECAL SEROSA. 
	GALLBLADDER WITH CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS. 
	UNREMARKABLE OMENTUM. 
	NO TUMOUR SEEN.
