Distribution:  
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, raised inhibin 77.  Ca 125 66.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary" consists of a white firm nodular mass,65 x 40 x 50mm.  Sectioning reveals a firm variegated cut surface, mostly yellowish solid surface with some intervening white area.  The capsule is smooth and 1 to 2mm in thickness.
Frozen section A1 - RS of yellowish solid area.  A2 - RS solid and white area.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 7 - one section of tumour (full face); 8 - the thinnest capsule area.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Cellular fibrothecoma.
Result to Dr Bud by Dr M Savitsky/Dr M Lem at 10:45am on 21.10.2065
B.  Specimen labelled "Left fallopian tube" consists of a cyst attached to the tube, measuring 40 x 75 x 55mm.  The cyst contains a yellowish serous fluid.  The stretched tube is 35mm long and 5mm wide.  Within the inner surface of the cyst wall are white nodules with papillary excrescences.  Two RS across the nodule.  The cyst wall is 1mm thick.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 6 - solidarea AE (3 - also contain the thin cyst wall); 7 - TS fallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign, favour serous cystadenoma with small benign Brenner component.
Result to Dr Israel by Dr M Senters/Dr M Herriot at10:45am on 21.10.2065
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of firm white nodule (? ovary) measuring 30 x 10 x 11mm with attached tube of 30mm long and 5mm wide.  The smaller tube is 10mm long and 5mm wide.  The nodule has homogenous white cut surface.  RS for frozen section.:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 5 - the remaining ovary AE; 6 - TS fallopian tube; 7 - LS ?fimbriae.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour 5mm fibroma.
Result to Dr Earnest by DrM Shotton/Dr M Zazozdor at 10:45am on 21.10.2065.
D.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, weighing 59g in total.  The uterus measures 50 x 25 x 83mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has a unremarkable surface.On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  Within the anterior myometrium is a circumscribed fibroid, 16 x 15 x 12mm.  The sectioning of the posterior myometrium is unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - fullLS of posterior body and cervix.  (TO: WALKER; Kulin/rt 22.10.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Arras):
A.  Sections of the ovary show a cellular lesion composed of intersecting fascicles of closely packed spindle cell.  The cells show scant cytoplasm and bland nuclear morphology.  Areas of intercellular oedema and focalectatic vessels can be seen.  There is no significant nuclear atypia and no tumour necrosis.  Mitotic activity is identified up to 5/10HPF.  No sex cord elements are present.  Features are of a cellular fibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
B.  Sections show a serous cystadenoma, marked by multiple cystic spaces variably lined by tall ciliated to flattened epithelium.  In some areas, papillary projections with secondary oedematous changes are present.  A focal area of dystrophic calcification can be seen.  A paratubal cyst is also evident merging into the ovarian lesion, composed of a thin fibromuscular wall with focal tubal type lining.  The fallopian tube and soft tissue elements show benign developmental remnants.  No significant histological abnormality isidentified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.    
C.  Sections of the ovary show features of a cystadenofibroma, comprising small cysts scattered within a fibroticstroma.  The ovary otherwise shows unremarkable parenchymal elements with no evidence of malignancy.  Sections from fallopian tube show no significant abnormality.
D.  Sections from the cervix show benign nabothian cysts.  The ectocervix appears unremarkable.  There is no endocervical glandular dysplasia.  The endometrium shows inactive glands with focal papillary syncytial metaplasia.  The myometrium contains a leiomyoma with no atypical features.  Focal adenomyosis can be seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A.Left ovary:  Cellular fibroma.
B.  Left fallopian tube:
	Serous cystadenoma.
	Paratubal cyst.

C.  Right tube and ovary:  Serous cystadenofibroma.
D.  Uterus and cervix:
	Unremarkable cervix.
	Inactive endometrium.
	Leiomyoma.
	Adenomyosis.
