Subtotal pancreatectomy for cysticpancreatic body lesion.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy" consists of subtotal pancreatectomy andsplenectomy with strip of omentum.  The spleen measures 110 x 65 x 35mm.  The pancreas measures 90mm (medial to lateral) x 45mm (superior to inferior) x 16mm (anterior to posterior).  The anterior surface ofthe pancreas appears haemorrhagic.  Spleen serially sliced into 5mm slices.  No abnormality is detected microscopically.  A strip of omentum is attached measuring 310 x 110 x 15mm.
(TO: TH; BT/rt 16.5.66). The pancreas measures 110 x 50 x 25mm and weighs 64g.  The pancreatic surgical margin is stapled which is removed to a thickness of 3mm and is inked black. The superior surface is inked black, the anterior surface is inked blue and the posterior surface is inked red.  Specimen serially sliced into fourteen slices from medial to lateral.  Within slices 5 to 7 is a unilocular smoothwalled cystic structure containing a thin brown fluid measuring 30mm anterior to posterior, 39mm inferior to superior, and 17mm medial to lateral.  
Block 1 - shave surgical margin; 2 - hilar vessels adjacent to spleen; 3 & 4 - slice 1; 5 & 6 - slice 2; 7 & 8 - slice 3; 9 & 10 - slice 4; 11-13 - slice 5; 14 & 15 - slice 6; 16 & 17 - slice 7; 18-20 - slice 8; 21 & 22 -slice 9; 23 & 24 - slice 10; 25 & 26 - slice 11; 27 - slice 12; 28 - slice 13; 29 - slice 14; 30 & 31 - representative sections spleen; 32-36 - ? lymph nodes and omental biopsy.  
All of thepancreas has been embedded.
(TO: XI/ec 16.5.66)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof X Southerland and Dr X Kuczkowski):
Sections of pancreas show a 25mm mucinous cystic neoplasm with a predominately denuded epithelium.  It is separated from the adjacent non-neoplastic atrophic pancreatic parenchyma by a band of collagenised tissue and a zone of pancreatic parenchymal atrophy and fibrosis.  
The regions of intact lining epithelium are composed of cuboidal-to-columnar mucinous cells arranged ina predominantly single layer with mild nuclear enlargement and atypia (consistent with low-grade dysplasia).  
No high grade dysplasia is identified.
There are distorted ducts within the wall of the cyst, some of which merge with atrophic lobules and islets. The lining ofsome of these ducts shows mild atypia and the appearances favour these as being part of the spectrum of atrophy and chronic inflammation surrounding the cyst. There is an associated ovarian-like fibrous stroma which is positive for CD10, PR, and ER.
The neoplasm is 2mm clear of both the anterior and posterior surfaces, and more than 10mm clear of the intra-pancreatic margin.
The pancreas distal to the neoplasm is largely unremarkable, as is the included spleen.  In some areas of marked parenchymal atrophy, there is a segmental loss of exocrine acini with only islets and ducts remaining (eg block 21). The islets appear paradoxically prominent in these areas. In one zone, identified in adjacent blocks 21 and 23, the islets are enlarged, clustered and show altered architecture. 
There is no sheet like growth, no significant atypia and no mitoses within these islets.
These sections have been reviewed with Dr X Pamintuan and Dr X Glave and the consensus opinion is that these changes probably represent an incidental, small (approximately 10mm) grade 1 pancreatic endocrine neoplasm which merges with parenchymal atrophy.
There are thirty (30) benign lymph nodes identified.  
There is no diagnostic evidence of invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy:
	25mm low-grade mucinous cystic neoplasm
	2mm clear of the anterior and posterior surfaces; well clear of the intra-pancreatic margin
	Incidental grade 1 pancreatic endocrine neoplasm 
	Thirty (30) uninvolved lymph nodes
	Peri-tumoural pancreatic atrophy
	Spleen shows no significant abnormality
