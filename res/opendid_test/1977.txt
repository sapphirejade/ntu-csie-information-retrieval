MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Esker):
The previous report 50Y98695 is noted with interest.
 
A & F.  Sections show low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma extensively involving the omentum.  The tumour has a predominant micropapillary pattern and is associated with scattered psammoma bodies and desmoplasia, and displays  haphazard infiltrative growth.  Moderate nuclear atypia is noted.
B, C & E.  Sections show smaller foci of low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma.
D.  Sections show a fatty liver.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Low grade / well differentiated serous carcinoma of peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, and also involving the small bowel mesentery, peritoneum and falciform ligament.
ADDITIONAL REPORT26/9/64:
The tumour is strongly and diffusely positive for ER and focally positive for PR.
