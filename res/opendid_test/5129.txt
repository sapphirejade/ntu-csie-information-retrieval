HISTORY:  
Prophylactic L mastectomy suture medial BRCA positive.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
"LEFT BREAST SUTURE MEDIAL".  An orientated mastectomywith marking suture denoting the medial margin. The specimen measures 360mm mediolaterally, 210mm superoinferiorly and 80mm anteroposteriorly. There is a skin ellipse on the anterior surface 300x130mm. The nipple is centrally located measuring up to 11mm in diameter.  In the 7 o'clock position, 90mm from the nipple there is a cyst up to 5mm. This cyst is 45mm from the posterior margin, and 80mm from the inferior margin. The remainder of the breast tissue shows fibrofatty change.  No lesions identified.  There is an unorientated ellipse of skin with some underlying fatty tissue measuring 100x40mm to a depth of 30mm.  No lesions identified.
(1&2 nipple; 3 upper inner quadrant; 4 lower inner quadrant; 5 lower outer quadrant; 6 upper outer quadrant; 7 central plate; 8 cyst; 9 representative piece of the additional piece of skin and fatty tissue). Further tissue 10 - 17, with2 lymph nodes from the axillary tail (15 and 16). RS (M-9/TS/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr R Aredondo)
Sections of nipple are unremarkable. Representative sections of all four quadrants of breast show some focal calcification within benign acini. There are also areas of columnar cell change, apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis and ductal epithelial hyperplasia of usual type. A small cyst is confirmed microscopically in the 7 o'clock position. Patchy fibrosis is noted. There is no evidence of in-situ or invasive malignancy in the representativetissue examined. The two lymph nodes show reactive changes only.
DIAGNOSIS:  
LEFT BREAST:  
 - PATCHY FIBROSIS, DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA, COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, CYSTIC CHANGE, SCLEROSING ADENOSIS AND APOCRINE METAPLASIA, (PLEASE SEE TEXT).
