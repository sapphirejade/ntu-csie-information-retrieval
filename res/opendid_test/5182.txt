CLINICAL:
Cervical cancer, glassy cell.  Cholecystectomy.  TKR.  Cystocele.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and vaginal cuff, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 88g in total.  The uterus measures 35 x 25 x 70mm and the serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The ectocervix is partly distorted and measures 30 x 30mm.  The posterior vaginal cuff is 10mm in maximum length and the anterior vaginal cuff is 20mm in maximum length at the midline.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm long and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary measures 20 x 12 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm long and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary measures 15 x 13 x 5mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.
Within the endocervix there is an ulcerated firm grey/white tumour, 36x30x11mm.  This involves the anterior cervix and the left posterior cervix.  The tumour does not appear to extend into the lower uterine segment or the vaginal cuff.  It is mainly present in the lower half of the endocervical canal.  The overlying peritoneal surface is smooth and shiny.  It invades deeply into cervical stroma and is 1mm from the anterior peritoneum.  
Blocks:  1 to 29 - entire cervix embedded clockwise from anterior left lateral to posterior left lateral (block 2&3, 4&5, 6&7, 8&9, 10&11, 12&13, 14&15, 16&17, 23&24 - paired sections); 30 & 31 - anterior body and fundus; 32 & 33 - posterior body and fundus; 34 - right fimbria; 35 - right tube; 36 - right ovary; 37 -left fimbria; 38 - left tube; 39 - left ovary.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of three nodes, 7 x 5 x 5mm to 25 x 10 x 10mm.  
Blocks:  1- one node bisected; 2- one node bisected; 3-one node trisected
C.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 15 x 10 x 5mm.  One possible node is identified, 15 x 8 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 40 x 15 x 8mm.  An elongated lymph node is present measuring 40 x 10 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1- half of the lymph node bisected; 2 & 3 - composite section other half of the lymph node.  AE.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 15 x 10 x 8mm and 25 x 15 x 5mm.  Two possible nodes are identified, 7 x 5 x 5mm and 20 x 12 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1- one node bisected; 2- one node bisected.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 50 x 15 x 10mm in aggregate.  Three possible nodes are identified, 10 x 5 x5mm to 30 x 15 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1 - one node bisected; 2- one node bisected; 3 & 4 - one node (half in each block).  (TO: Kristopher:  STEVIE/mm 11.3.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr P Sandahl and Dr P Kertz): 
A.  Sections of cervix show a circumferential poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The malignant cells have pleomorphicnuclei and moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are scattered dyskeratotic cells and foci of keratinisation.  No gland formation is seen and no intracytoplasmic mucin is identified with PASD or alcian blue stains.  Some ofthe cells have a 'glassy' appearance similar to the previous lletz biopsy (55U99370) but most of the tumour has features more in keeping with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  No definite glandular differentiation is seen in the present specimen and there was only focal intracytoplasmic mucin identified in the previous lletz specimen.  The tumour is therefore considered to be best regarded as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is 10mm out of a total cervical stromal thickness of 12mm.
There is very extensive lymphovascular invasion including foci of invasion of small muscular veins outside the bulk of thetumour.  The carcinoma pushes upward into the myometrium.  The carcinoma is estimated to be 36mm in maximum dimension. 
There is CIN 3 present on the surface of the tumour.  No adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS) is identified.
All excision margins are free of invasive carcinoma.  Tumour is 4mm from the nearest vaginal cuff margin and is 0.5mm from the nearest radial cervical stronal margin (anterior).  There is no tumour invasion of left or right paracervical soft tissues.  The vaginal cuff margin is also free of CIN 3/VAIN 3.
Sections ofuterus show inactive endometrium.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  Sections show three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/3).
C.  Sections show one lymphnode with no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
D.  Sections show one lymph node with no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
E.  Sections show two lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/2).
F.  Sections show three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/3).

DIAGNOSIS:
A to F
- Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix.
- FIGO stage 1B1.
- Extensive lymphovascular invasion.
- No lymph node metastases (0/10).
