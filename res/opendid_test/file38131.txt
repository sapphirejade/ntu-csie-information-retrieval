CLINICAL NOTES:
1.  Gallbladder
2.  Spleen
3.  Peritoneal disease

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN&amp;quot;.  Received in one jar, multiple tissue fragments including a gallbladder 90x35mm.  The outer surface is ragged and becomes haemorrhagic towards the neck.  The wall is up to 4mm thick.  The mucosal surfaces are green and granular with focal yellow flecking.  One calculus is identified 30x20x15mm.

(1 cystic duct and TS neck; 2 TS body and LS fundus;

A spleen, 180g, measuring 125x85x55mm.  The capsular surface has a ragged area with firm white deposits over 80x35mm.  The cut surface reveals a variegated, firm, white and haemorrhagic tissue invading into the capsule but no invasion into the splenic parenchyma.

3&amp;amp;4 capsule involvement; 5 normal spleen;

A mass covered with peritoneum weighing 1880g measuring 205x170x95mm with attached peritoneal strip 175x120x20mm.  The mass outer surface is smooth and lobulated  and covered with thin transparent membrane and is ragged with visible tumour over 40x20mm.  The attached peritoneal strip has a ragged cut surface with disseminated friable brown and firm white deposits.   The possible resection margin is inked blue.  The mass is serially sliced. The cut surface reveals a variegated solid and cystic firm white and haemorrhagic cut surface with scattered blood clots and areas of necrosis.  Loosely attached to the main mass are smaller nodular lesions measuring 50mm, 35mm and 45mm in maximum dimension.

6&amp;amp;7 large mass with resection margin; 8 peritoneal strip; 9-11 mass with overlying serosa; 12&amp;amp;13 smaller peripheral nodules;

Received multiple scattered tumour nodules 175x135x35mm.  Multiple nodules are identified on the outer surface measuring 5-35mm in maximum diameter.  The cut surface is variegated,  haemorrhagic, cystic and solid.

14 RS smaller nodules; 15 larger solid nodules [also tumour block for tissue banking]).  RS (M-15/ZH 10/6/2069 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. U. Myung)
Sections show multiple deposits of adult granulosa cell tumour with insular, trabecular and watered-silk patterns of growth.  Areas of Call-Exner body formation also seen.  The tumour cells show intranuclear grooves and a mitotic rate of up to 8/10 hpfs is present.

The tumour is seen to involve capsule of spleen and separately submitted peritoneal fragments.  In one of the sections the tumour appears to extend into the muscularis of a small viscous most likely representing appendix.

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive staining with inhibin-a, vimentin and SMA with no staining for EMA, calretinin, CK7 or Cam5.2.

Sections through the gallbladder show no significant abnormality with no tumour involvement.
The splenic parenchyma is also unremarkable.

DIAGNOSIS:
PERITONEAL DISEASE, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN :
-DISSEMINATED ADULT GRANULOSA CELL TUMOUR.
