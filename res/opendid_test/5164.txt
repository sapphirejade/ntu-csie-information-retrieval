CLINICAL:
Previous borderline ovarian tumour.  Completion surgery.  TLHUSO, pelvic washings, and omental biopsy.  Histopathology uterus and cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary.  H/O depression and PND.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left tube, ovary, right tube" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and left ovary weighing 117g in total (no right fallopian tube is found within the specimen container or on the specimen).  The uterus measures85 x 50 x 42mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The cervix measures 35 x 33mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is up to 20mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length x 7 x 6mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 40 x 30 x 20mm and has a solid and cystic cut surface.  The cysts are smooth lined and unilocular and filledwith clear serous fluid.  The cyst lining is smooth and no papillary excrescences are identified.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body andcervix; 7 & 8 - fallopian tube; 9 to 14 - representative ovary; 15 - ovary for possible Bio Bank.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 20 x 8mm.  No lesion is identified within the fibrofatty tissue.  AE 2 blocks.  (TO: ZT; NQ/rt 23.9.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Harradine):
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is in proliferative phase.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the ovary show several cystic follicles.  The ovary is otherwise unremarkable.
B.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No abnormality is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, left ovary and fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality.
B.  Omental biopsy:  No abnormality seen.
