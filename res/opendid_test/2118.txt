HISTORY:  
G1 endometrioid adenoca.  Treated with endometrial hyperplasia.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES".  A uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 150g.  The uterus measures up to 60mm from medial to lateral, 90mm from fundus to cervix and 40mm fromanterior to posterior. The serosal surface anteriorly shows a cyst like structure 7mm in maximal extent (inked red).  The cervix measures 30mm in maximum diameter and is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures up to 75mm in length and 8mm in maximal external diameter.  The right ovary measures up to 35x35x20mm and has some ? haemorrhagic cysts.  The left fallopian tube measures up to 80mm in length and 7mm in maximal external diameter. The left ovary measures up to 35x20x15mm.  The anterior cervical margin is inked blue and the posterior margin is inked black.  On sectioning the endometrium is pale and necrotic focally.  It measures up to 8mm in thickness and myometrium measures 15mm in thickness.  On sectioning the endometrial tumour does not extend more than half the thickness of the entire wall.  There are some intramural ? fibroids up to 5mm in maximal extent.  On sectioning the ovaries show bilateral haemorrhagic filled cysts.  The tumour extends to the right and left cornu areas.
(1-4 anterior cervix to fundus; 5-8 posterior cervix to fundus -[notches inferior]; 9 anterior serosalsurface cyst; 10 TS/LS right fallopian tube; 11&12 paired representative LS right ovary; 13 LS/TS left fallopian tube; 14&15 LS left ovary; 16 further endometrium with tumour; 17 right cornu; 18 left cornu; 19 right parametrial tissue; 20left parametrial tissue).  RS (M-20)
(Further tissue: 21-35 remaining endometrium) RS (M-35/BU)
B.  "OMENTAL BIOPSY". A portion of omentum measuring up to 60x30x10mm.  No suspicious areas seen on inspection or sectioning. 
(1-4 RS).  RS (M-4)
C.  "UMBILICAL NODULE".  A piece of pale firm tissue measuring 7mm in maximal extent.  AE (1-1/PD/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Q. Burrough)
A. Assessment of the specimen is severely hampered by extensive necrosis involving the endometrium and sub-endometrial myometrium. The entire endometrium has been embedded and examined. Only a very tiny amount of semi-viable endometrium is present, and it shows complex hyperplasia with atypia. In addition, one tiny detached and degenerate tissue fragment within the endometrial cavity shows some atypical cribriform glands, with an appearance in keeping with a tiny fragment of FIGO Grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma (nuclear Grade 1, architecture Grade 1). However, this tiny fragment is only 1mm in size, and may not be representative of the entire tumour. Correlation with any previous histology report is strongly recommended. The entire endometrium and sub-endometrial myometrium has been embedded and examined, andno definite invasion is seen, although assessment is severely hampered by extensive necrosis. Extensive adenomyosis is present. Clinical correlation is required.
Specimen A: 
Tumour type:  Probable endometrial carcinoma (based on a 1mm degenerate detached tissue fragment, with no residual viable tumour being present for assessment, due to extensive necrosis).
FIGO grade:  Probable Grade 1 
(architecture grade: 1, nuclear grade: 1, also based on this 1mm fragment, which may or may not be representative of the tumour.)
Myometrial invasion:  None identified, although assessment is severely hampered by extensive necrosis
Myometrial thickness:  15mm
Focality:  Unable to be assessed due to necrosis
Tumour involves:
Lower uterine segment : no involvement seen. 
Cervical glands: no involvement seen. 
Cervical stroma: no involvement seen.
 Parametrium: no involvement seen.
Vascular/lymphatic invasion:  Not seen
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Involvement of uterine serosa:  Not involved
Non-tumour uterus:  Complex hyperplasia with atypia.
                                     Adenomyosis:  (Extensive)
Adnexae:  
Left fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality
Right fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality
Left ovary:  Follicular cyst/s
Right ovary:  Follicular cyst/s
Lymph nodes:  None identified.
Specimen B: 
Sections show lobules of adipose tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
Specimen C:
Sections of skin show a squamous papilloma. There is no atypia of the squamous epithelium. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES:
- EXTENSIVE NECROSIS INVOLVING ENDOMETRIUMAND UNDERLYING MYOMETRIUM. ONE TINY FRAGMENT OF PROBABLE GRADE 1 ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE ENDOMETRIAL CAVITY. 
- ADENOMYOSIS.
- COMPLEX HYPERPLASIA WITH ATYPIA (PLEASE SEE TEXT FOR DETAILS).
B. OMENTAL BIOPSY:
- NO INVOLVEMENT SEEN.
C. UMBILICAL NODULE:
- SQUAMOUS PAPILLOMA.
