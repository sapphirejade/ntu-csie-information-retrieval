MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, tubes, ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 49.5g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 48 x 25mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 8mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  There are multiple peritubular and parafimbrial cysts measuring 2mm to 6mm in diameter.  The ovaries measure 25 x 13 x 12mm.  The right ovary is serially sliced into seven sections.  The cut surface shows two separate biloculated cysts like structure., ranges from 4mm to 6mm in maximum diameter.  The cyst like structure has a pale tan cyst wall and the internal surface appears to be smooth macroscopically.  The left fallopian tube measures, 50mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  There are multiple peritubular and parafimbrial cysts, ranging from 2mm to 6mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 28 x 9 x 10mm.  The left ovary is serially sliced into seven sections, the cut surface shows a homogenous pale tan colour. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are all embedded. Blocks: 1 &amp;amp; 2 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 3 to 5 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 6 to 10 - right ovary (6 &amp;amp; 10 - ends TS of ovary); 11 to 14 - right fallopian tube (11 - fimbria head); 15 to 19 - left ovary (15 &amp;amp; 19 - end TS of ovary); 20 to 22 - left fallopian tube (20 - LS fimbria head of left fallopian tube).  RS 22 blocks.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of a piece of unorientated fibrofatty tissue, 50 x 30 x 10mm.  The specimen is homogenous, yellow fatty tissue, and prominent vein.  No definite lymph node is identified.  AE 3 blocks.  (TO:XS/ta 20/7/69)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Tervo):
A. The ovaries and fallopian tubes have been all embedded.
Sections of the fallopian tubes and ovaries show no evidence of malignancy. A small Walthard nest is seen in the right fallopian tube.
The endometrium is atrophic. There is no evidence of hyperplasia or malignancy.
The ectocervical squamous mucosa appears atrophic. There is no evidence of HPV effect, CIN or malignancy.
B. Sections show omental fat with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Uterus and cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes: no evidence of malignancy
B. Omentum: no evidence of malignancy
