CLINICAL NOTES:
1. Peritoneal washings for cyto.
2. Uterus, tubes and ovaries.
3. Omentum.
Rapidly enlarging fibroid ? leiomyosarcoma.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;CERVIX +  UTERUS + BILATERAL TUBES + OVARIES&amp;quot;. The specimen measures 200x160x90mm and weighs 1446g overall and consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries and includes a large mass on the left hand side.  The anterior side of the uterus is inked blue, the posterior side is inked black.

The right tube is 40mm in length, 6mm in diameter and 16mm across the fimbriae. There are no focal lesions. The right ovary is 27x22x13mm.  The left tube is 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter and is 17mm across the fimbria which appear adherent to the fundus of the uterus.  The left ovary is 31x22x13mm.

The uterus is 100mm longitudinally, 65mm between the cornu, and 50mm anteroposteriorly. The cervix is 30x20mm in transverse section and 30mm in length. The external cervical os is 3x1mm. The endometrium is 1mm in thickness. The anterior myometrium is up to 22mm in thickness. The posterior myometrium is up to 22mm in thickness. There are multiple cream whorled nodules in the myometrium up to 9mm across. The serosa of the uterus is smooth with no distortions of the uterus itself.

Attached by loose tissue to the left hand side of the uterus there is a mass measuring 200x160x85mm, which is smoothly encapsulated with a vascular fascial surface. The cut surface shows a lobulated cream and grey coloured cut surface.  The mass is contained within the uterine serosa but is loosely attached with serosal fibrous tissue and separate from the myometrium.

(1-9 right side [1-8 right tube and ovary all embedded from proximal to distal, 7&amp;amp;8 fimbriae; 9 right parametrial shave]; 10-19 left side [10-18 left adnexal tissue including tube and ovary all embedded; 19 left parametrial shave]; 20 cervix anterior and posterior; 21 anterior myometrium; 22 posterior myometrium; 23 fundus; 24-28 loose connective tissue between uterus and mass; 29-48 representative mass). Representative sections. (M-48)

B. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. One piece of fatty tissue 42x23x5mm. No lesions identified. All embedded in blocks 1 and 2. All embedded. (2-2/FR 21/10/2068 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. Y. Erlich)
A. Both the right and left ovaries show a few small non-necrotising epithelioid granulomas. The fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable. The endometrium is basal type. The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis and benign leiomyomas.
The large nodule is loosely attached to the left side of the uterus by vascular oedematous fibrofatty tissue and smooth muscle fibres. It shows benign smooth muscle cells in long fascicles, thin fibres and anastomosing thread-like ribbons separated by extensive oedema, some fibrosis and areas of stromal hyalinisation. This imparts a nodular architecture in some blocks. There are variably-sized vessels, some with thick hyalinised walls, scattered throughout the nodule. Many of these are congested and some show perivascular swirling of bland tumour cells.  There is no nuclear atypia, no mitoses and no coagulative tumour necrosis. A small collection of mature adipocytes is present in one block (A42).

Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for desmin, SMA, patchy vimentin and PR. There is negative staining for HMB45, MelanA, CD117, S100.

Comment:
The features are of a leiomyoma with extensive oedema / hydropic change (possibly due to torsion). A PEComa and angiomyolipoma were considered in the differential diagnosis, but the immunoprofile does not fit these entities.
Special stains for microorganisms to follow on the sections of the ovaries.

B. The omental fat shows minimal haemorrhage and fibrosis, there is no malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A. CERVIX +  UTERUS + BILATERAL TUBES + OVARIES -  Benign lieomyoma with hydropic change

B. OMENTAL BIOPSY  -  No evidence of malignancy
