SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (27.11.65):


CLINICAL:
Right upper lobectomy for NSCLC: specimen includes right paratracheal lymph node and right upper lobe.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "R upper lobe" consists of a lobectomy specimen 160 x 115 x 17mm.  The hilar margin is inked blue.  Slicing reveals a solid tumour with tan and focally necrotic cut surfaces 45 x 35 x 25mm.  The tumour is 50mm from the bronchialresection margin and focally abuts the pleural surface.  There is a solid mass, apparently two matted lymph nodes, at the hilar margin; this measures 35 x 20 x 15mm.    
Blocks: 1 - vascular margins; 2 - shave bronchial margin; 3 & 4 - tumour abutting pleura; 5 - one bisected hilar lymph node; 6 to 8 - one hilar lymph node; 9 - tumour, reserve block; 10 to 13 - sections of tumour; 14 - lung parenchyma away from tumour.  Re-select - 15 to 20 - further sections of tumour (NO 26.11.65).
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Hilar lymph node" consists of a lymph node measuring 12 x 8 x 4mm.  TAE 1 block.  
C.  Specimen labelled "R paratracheal LN" consists of fatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 30 x 20 x 10mm.  Several lymph nodes are identified, the largest 12mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes as seen; 2 to 4 - each one lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Berrios): 
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung.  The tumour is acinar predominant with only a very minor component of lepidic growth pattern.  The acinar component consists of irregular glands lined by cellswith large, highly pleomorphic nuclei and generally abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Many of the nuclei have a single prominent nucleolus.  There is a prominent lymphovascular invasion within the tumour.  There are foci of tumour necrosis.  The tumour extends up to the overlying lateral pleura and focally tumour cells are seen on the visceral pleural surface (block A4).  A small carcinoid tumourlet is also noted within the tumour (block A4).
Bronchial andvascular resection margins at the hilum are free of tumour.
Sections of two hilar lymph nodes show metastatic adenocarcinoma in both nodes.  There is extranodal spread from one of the involved hilar nodes and this extranodal tumour is seen extending to a diathermied resection margin (block A8).
Some of the metastatic tumour in the hilar nodes has a micropapillary pattern but this is not identified in the sections of the main tumour which have been examined; further sections will be examined and a supplementary report issued.
A section of lung away from the tumour shows some emphysematous changes but is otherwiseunremarkable.
B.  Sections show one node with involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
C.  Sections show nine lymph nodes.  There is metastatic adenocarcinoma involving eight nodes.   No extranodal spread is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right upper lobe:  Moderately differentiated acinar predominant adenocarcinoma with hilar lymph node metastases (2/2) and invasion through visceral pleura.  
B.  Hilar lymph node:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (1/1).
C.  Right paratracheal lymph nodes:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma in eight nodes (8/9).  
pT2a   pN2 (at least).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (27.11.65):
A.  Further sections of the primary lung tumour have been taken because a component of adenocarcinoma with a micropapillary pattern was found in some of the lymph node metastases.
Adenocarcinoma witha micropapillary pattern is identified in some of the further sections.
Adenocarcinoma with a micropapillary pattern has a more aggressive behaviour than other histologic patterns of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
