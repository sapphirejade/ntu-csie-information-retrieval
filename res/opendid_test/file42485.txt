CLINICAL NOTES:
Peritonectomy.  Mesenteric lymph node frozen section.  Peritonectomy ovarian ca.
Pelvic peritoneum. Small bowel lymph node.  Spleen.  Pelvic lymph node. Right diaphragm. Appendix.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of a pale tan lymph node 8x5x5mm.

F/S : &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;.  Reported to anaesthetist Theatre 10 by Dr. H. Torra at 3.15pm on 09.02.69.  AE (1-1)

B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEUM, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, APPENDIX&amp;quot;.  Consists of gallbladder, spleen, piece of fibrous tissue with possible muscle ? diaphragm, appendix and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum.  The gallbladder measures 65x25mm. The serosal surface is rough and ? adhesions.  No tumour deposit is identified. The wall is up to 4mm thick.  Mucosa is granular green in appearance.  No stones are found within the lumen.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).

Spleen with attached hilar fat.  It weighs 210g and measures 80x90x30mm.  At one edge is a nodule bulging the capsule. The nodule measures 35x25x25mm and has a pale white appearance.  On sectioning through the nodule it has a tan cut surface.  On sectioning the splenic parenchyma it is red, no other lesion is identified.

(3-6 sections of nodule [5 includes splenic parenchyma, 6 includes splenic capsule {6 tumour block}].

Fibrous tissue ? diaphragm altogether 130x90x10mm.  On sectioning there is a pale white nodular tumour 10mm maximum dimension.

(7 two sections of ? diaphragm)

Appendix measures 25mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm. The serosa appears unremarkable.  Base is inked blue.  On sectioning the wall  is up to 3mm thick.  Entire appendix embedded.

(8 Appendix)

Separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum altogether 170x110x20mm within which there are multiple tumour nodules.

(9&amp;amp;10 peritoneum including tumour nodules).  RS (M-10)

C.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  Consists of one node 12x10x6mm.  Bisected.  AE (2-1)

D.  &amp;quot;PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of one node 12x9x5mm.  Bisected.  AE (2-1/MC 14/2/2069 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Compagna)
A.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in one reactive lymph node.

B.  Histology shows multiple large deposits of metastatic high grade serous carcinoma which are found predominantly as a large nodular deposit over the capsule of the spleen and also with deposits in the peritoneum, diaphragm, and focally on the serosa of the appendix.  Tumour deposits grow in a sheet-like acinar and micropapillary architecture with high grade cytological atypia and frequent mitotic figures. Immunostains show positivity for CK7, WT1, ER (30% 2+). P53 is completely negative consistent with mutated phenotype. PR and CK20 are negative. Ki67 is 50%.  Focal tumour necrosis is also evident.  The gallbladder is not involved but shows mild chronic cholecystitis.

C.  Histology shows peritoneal tissue which contains a deposit of metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.  No evidence of a residual lymph node structure is seen.

D.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in one lymph node.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE -  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 1 NONE
B.  PERITONEUM, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM, APPENDIX -
-  METASTATIC SEROUS CARCINOMA
C.  SMALL BOWEL LYMPH NODE -
-  PERITONEAL DEPOSIT OF METASTATIC SEROUS CARCINOMA
D.  PELVIC LYMPH NODE  -  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 1 NODE
