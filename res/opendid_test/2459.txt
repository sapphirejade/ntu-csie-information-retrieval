Distribution:     FILE-COPY
HISTORY:
50yo male with mucinous ascites. post peritonectomy. Right colon and appendix, omentum, peritoneum, gallbladder. 
MACROSCOPIC:
"OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE". 
Gallbladder: A gallbladder measuring 75mm in length and 40mm in diameter. There is no cystic duct lymph node identified. The external surface is unremarkable. On opening there is a bile and the mucosa is green and velvety. No stones identified.
(1 TS resection margin; 2 representative TS body).
Omentum:  An omentum measuring 600x270x35mm with multiple gelatinous tumour deposits. The largest involved areas measures over 100mm in maximum extent. 
(3-10 representative tumour deposits). 
Peritoneal disease:  Multiple strips of peritoneum with attached fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 120x100x70mm. There are multiple gelatinous tumour deposits on all pieces. The largest deposit measures 70mm in maximum extent. 
(11-14 RS).
Right hemicolon:  A right hemicolectomy measuring up to 350mm in length including 170mm of terminal ileum. There is an appendix attached measuring 70mmin length and up to 20mm in diameter where it appears to be a tumour protruding from the distal tip. The external surface shows possible tumour deposits. On opening there is a polyp noted in the ascending colon region 25mm from the distalresection margin. 
(15 LS resection margins and ascending colon polyp; 16-18 LS distal appendix; 19 two TS mid appendix; 20 LS proximal appendix; 21&22 possible tumour deposits on serosal surface near caecum and ascending colon; 23 two mesenteric nodes; 24 four possible mesenteric nodes; 25 two possible mesenteric nodes; 26-29 tumour reserved blocks). RS (M-29/EU/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr G Terrell)
Sections show low grade mucinous neoplasm comprising of low grade mucinous epithelium associated with extensive extracellular mucin lakes resulting in pseudomyxoma peritonei. The tumour is seen to involve the serosa of the gallbladder, omentum, separately submitted peritoneal fragments, appendiceal mesentery and serosa of right colon. 
The gallbladder mucosa shows no abnormality. Sections through the right hemicolon show a tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia in ascending colon and otherwise no focal mucosal abnormality. Sections through distal appendix show a low grade mucinous neoplasm replacing the appendiceal mucosa. The appendiceal wall appears intact, although extra appendiceal serosal and mesenteric deposits of low grade mucinous neoplasm are identified. The proximal appendix is unremarkable.
The surgical margins of resection of the right hemicolectomy specimen are clear of any lesions. Seven mesenteric lymph nodes examined show reactive changes. 
No desmoplastic destructive tumour invasion is identified. 
DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
 - LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM RESULTING IN PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI. 
APPENDIX: 
 - LOW GRADE APPENDICEAL MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.
