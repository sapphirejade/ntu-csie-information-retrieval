HISTORY:
CRC, peritonectomy.  Tiny S/surface lesion ?Ca or not.  Frozen section.
Small bowel/colon, seminal vesicles, gallbladder, pelvic mass/peritoneum, abdominal wall.  
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "SMALL BOWEL NODES".  Two pieces of pale tissue 3 and 6mm in maximum extent.  The larger piecebisected.  All embedded for FS.  
Frozen section result:  "Negative".  Given by phone to Dr JULES Sabat at 11:02hrs, 24/03/66, FC.   
AE (M-1).
B.  "GALLBLADDER, SEMINAL VESICLES, PELVIC TUMOUR, SMALL BOWEL"  An intact gallbladder 70mm in length and up to 40mm in diameter.  The external surface is green and smooth.  The gallbladder was filled with bile.  The gallbladder wall measures up to 2mm thick.  The mucosal surface is green and velvety.  No tumour masses are identified.  
(1 TS from cystic duct and body; 2 LS from fundus;
Also received separately in the specimen jar were two grey tubular pieces of tissue.  The first measures 45mm in lengthand up to 6mm in diameter.  There is some attached fatty tissue up to 20mm.  The second tubular structure measures 46mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter with some attached fatty tissue up to 22mm.  These are possible seminal vesicles/ductus deferens.  
3 two TS from one of the ?vas deferens; 4 TS from the other ?vas deferens;
Also received separately in the specimen jar is some fatty tissue with attached skeletal muscle measuring 60x40x25mm.  Notumour identified.  This is the presumed abdominal wall.
5&6 contain sections from the ?abdominal wall;
There are also multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue with peritoneum, in aggregate 160x110x50mm.  Three tumournodules are identified ranging from 7-15mm.  The remainder of the tissue is unremarkable.  
7 section from normal appearing peritoneum and fatty tissue; 8&9 normal appearing fatty tissue; 10-12 tumour nodules identified withinthe fatty tissue;
Also received separately in the specimen jar is a segment of small bowel which has looped upon itself and is adhered to itself.  Cut sectioning reveals a tumour nodule measuring up to 20mm.  It is a bit difficult to measure the exact length of the segment of small bowel due to the nature of the adhesions.  An estimate length is 150mm and diameter up to 30mm.  There is some attached fatty tissue which is also adhered to the bowel up to 100mm.  Two lymph nodes identified, one of which is involved ranging from 7-15mm.  
13&14 sections through the tumour nodule from the small bowel; 15&16 resection margin ends; 17&18 lymph nodes [17 one lymph node, 18 one lymph nodeinvolved]).  RS (M-18/NQnh).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Y. Zambotti)
A.  Sections show fragment of smooth muscle presumably arising from bowel wall. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous differentiation in keeping with origin from colorectal primary involving separately submitted peritoneal fragments, mesentery of small bowel segment with extension into wall and submucosa including involvement of two local lymph nodes and adipose tissue surrounding one vas deferens. 
Sections through the gallbladder show no evidence of tumour. Sections through presumed abdominal wall also show fibrosis with no evidence of tumour. 
Noseminal vesicles are seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
SMALL BOWEL NODES:  
 - UNREMARKABLE MUSCULARIS PROPRIA. 
GALLBLADDER, SEMINAL VESICLES, PELVIC TUMOUR, SMALL BOWEL:
 - METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA WITH MUCINOUS DIFFERENTIATION INVOLVING MESENTERY AND WALL OF SEGMENT OF SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS AND ADIPOSE TISSUE SURROUNDING VAS DEFERENS. METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN TWO LYMPH NODES FROM SMALL BOWEL SEGMENT.
