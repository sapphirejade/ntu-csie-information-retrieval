MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE 1&amp;quot;  AE in one block
B.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE 2&amp;quot;  AE in one block
C.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL DISEASE 3&amp;quot; AE in one block
Each specimen consists of pale soft to firm tissue from 5-7mm in diameter.  Each embedded in separate chuck.

Frozen section report (A, B &amp;amp; C):  &amp;quot;Consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma&amp;quot;.  Given by phone to Dr Mikovec (Liver Fellow) at 15:55hrs on the 22-Oct-2068 by J Mcnelis

D.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;.  Two pieces of tissue.  One is a short segment of small bowel with one edge stapled.  It measures 80mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm.  The serosa adjacent to the non-surgically stapled margin is roughened with possible mucinous tumour deposits.  This margin is inked blue, the opposite margin is inked black.  The mucosa is unremarkable.  Also received separately is a small portion of bowel mucosa.  It measures 15mm in length by 20x10mm.  The serosa is roughened and the entire second piece embedded in blocks one and two.

(1&amp;amp;2 second piece;  3 margins short segment of small bowel; 4 further sections of small bowel.  RS (M-4/MC 25/10/2069 nh)

MICROSCOPIC: (Dr J Druetta)
A, B &amp;amp; C.  Paraffin sections of each of these specimens confirms fibrofatty tissues with fibroblastic reaction and with mucin pools of variable cellularity including some with high cellularity with nests of atypical cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and eccentrically located nuclei are identified.  Nuclear shape and membrane irregularities and nuclear hyperchromasia are present.  Scattered single cells with similar features including some signet-ring cells are identified within the mucin pools and within fibrous connective tissue.  The appearances are those of mucinous adenocarcinoma (with signet-ring cells).
D.  Sections of the segment of small bowel and the small pieces of small bowel demonstrate mucinous adenocarcinoma similar to that seen in specimens A, B and C.  It is present on the serosal surfaces with some areas showing infiltration of the muscularis propria and submucosa as well as lymphatic space invasion.  The mucosa of the small bowel appears unremarkable in the sections examined.
Comment:  The appearances are those of mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
DIAGNOSIS:
A, B, C &amp;amp; D.  PERITONEAL DISEASE 1, 2 AND 3, AND SMALL BOWEL:
-  MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA (WITH SIGNET-RING CELLS)
