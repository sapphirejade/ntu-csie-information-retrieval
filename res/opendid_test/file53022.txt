Hookwire excisional biopsy of L breast 12 o&amp;apos;clock.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;LEFT BREAST WIDE LOCAL EXCISION&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE:  Left
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Wide local excision, not oriented
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  Yes, hookwire split seen at G8
HOOKWIRE:  Yes
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:  Specimen is unoriented.  It measures 30x20x20mm
WEIGHT:  11g
SKIN:  No
NIPPLE:  No
MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  Not applicable
MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard:  Site of hookwire yellow, remainder blue.
DISSECTION: Cut from one end to another.
Number of slices:  7
FINDINGS / LESION:  At the site of hookwire split is an ectatic duct.  No discrete lesion is identified.  The site of hookwire split is between slices 2 and 3.  Entire specimen is embedded.
(1  longitudinal through slice 1; 2  slice 2; 3  slice 3; 4  slice 4; 5  slice 5; 6  slice 6; 7  longitudinal through other end slice 7).  AE (M-7/MC 21/4/2068 km).

DCIS OF THE BREAST, SYNOPTIC REPORT

DCIS size: 16mm

Nuclear grade: Low

Architecture / type: Cribriform

Necrosis: Absent

Microcalcification of DCIS: Not present

LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS): &amp;#160;Not identified

EXCISION MARGINS: Positive.
Site and extent of margin involvement:
One or two ducts of DCIS extend to reach an inked margin of excision in 2 adjacent slices of tissue, approximately 3-4mm wide (specimen was not orientated)

ANCILLARY TESTS:
IMMUNOSTAINS, blocks 4 &amp;amp; 5.
ER:  POSITIVE   95%  3+
PR:  POSITIVE   95%  3+

Comment : The excision specimen shows an area of mature fibrous scarring suggestive of previous biopsy site.  In the immediately adjacent breast are numerous cribriforming ducts within 4 consecutive slices of tissue (16mm wide) which have features of low grade ductal carcinoma in situ focally extending to one inked margin of excision in 2 separate slices (not orientated). There is widespread benign microcalcification with sclerosing adenosis in the background, with no significant calcification seen within DCIS. No invasion is identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
LEFT BREAST WIDE LOCAL EXCISION - 16mm OF LOW GRADE DCIS WITH AN INVOLVED MARGIN
