CLINICAL:
Right breast cancer - WLE = SLNBx.  Right breast cancer at 12 o'clock 5cm FN.  
1.  Right breast lump:  marking - long lateral, short superior, double deep.
2.  Further excision deep margin; marking- long lateral, short superior, double cavity. 
3.  Sentinel lymph node.  
R breast lesion at 12 o'clock excised with skin ellipse to chest wall.  Further excision of deep margin with fascia of pec major.  Please note:  diagram on request form.  

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast sentinel node" consists of two pieces of tissue 27 x 25 x 15mm and 27 x 22 x 14mm.  Slicing reveals two lymph nodes 18 and 12mm in maximum dimension.  The cut surfacesof both lymph nodes show extensive fatty change.  Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node; 3 & 4 - one lymph node.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue stitch long lateral, short superior, double deep" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches measuring 65 (lateral to medial) x 125mm (superior to inferior) x 60mm (superficial to deep).  The overlying skin ellipse measures 27 x 105mm.  No lesions are seen on the skin.  The margins are inked in three colours, lateral - green, medial - red and deep - black.  Specimen is serially sectioned into nineteen slices from superior to inferior.  Extending from slice nine to eleven there is an ill defined pale solid tumour measuring 15 x 18 x 14mm.  The tumour is 6mm from lateral, 2mm from medial, 2mm from deep and 45mm from superficial margins.  The tumour is 40mm from superior and38mm from inferior margins.  There are patchy pale streaks throughout the specimen.  
Blocks: 1 - slice one en face (superior margin); 2 to 6 - slice eight; 7 to 13 - slice nine; 14 to 21 - slice ten (20 is trimmed off 19; 19 reserve block; 20 - ERPR, Her2, Ki-67); 22 to 28 - slice eleven; 29 to 34 - slice twelve; 35 to 40 - slice sixteen; 41 to 45 - slice seventeen;46 & 47 - slice nineteen serially sectioned (inferior margin).  
Please see the diagram.  

C.  Specimen labelled "Deep cavity of breast stitch double deep, cavity long lateral, short superior" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitchesmeasuring 30 x 80 x 10mm.  The surfaces are inked in three colours; superior margin - red, cavity side - (marked by double suture) inked black, opposite surface -green.  Specimen is serially sectioned into fifteen slices from superior to inferior.  The cut surfaces are fatty.  No distinct lesions are identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 15 - entire specimen sequentially blocked from superior to inferior.  AE.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof Q Piety and Dr Q Blotsky): 
 A&B. Sections show infiltrating ductal carcinoma arising from encysted papillary carcinoma (specimen B). Changes consistent with previous biopsy are seen within the carcinoma.
Invasive carcinoma:
Site: Right breast 
Type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, no special type, with an immediately adjacent component of encysted papillary carcinoma. A similar in situ component is seen within both areas, suggesting a direct relationship between the infiltrating duct carcinoma and encysted papillary carcinoma. 
Invasive tumour size: 18mm - infiltrating duct carcinoma. The adjacent encysted papillary carcinoma is 10mm, giving a total lesion size approximately 28mm. 
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 1
Tubules: 2      Nuclei:  2   Mitoses: 1    Mitotic rate:  4 /10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: A suspicious focus is present in one block(B18), whichi shows inconclusive staining with CD31 and D240. 
	    
Encysted papillary carcinoma:
Maximum extent: 10mm
Nuclear grade:  Intermediate 

DCIS component:  
DCIS:  Present
Maximum extent of DCIS: 3mm - many of the spaces within the tumour which morphologically resemble DCIS are shown to lack a myoepithelial layer in p63 and keratin 5/6 staining, consistent with DCIS-like invasivecarcinoma. 
Nuclear grade:  Intermediate
Architecture: Solid and cribriform
Necrosis:  Not seen
Calcification: Not seen
Degree of DCIS in tumour:  Minimal
DCIS in adjacent tissue:  At edge of main tumour. 
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component: 
	4.5mm from medial 
	3mm from deep
	>10mm from all other margins

Encysted papillary carcinoma:
	0.3 - 1mm from deep (margin has fragmented and deeper levels have been examined - block B28)
	>10mm from all other margins
In-situcomponent:
	9mm from medial 
	>10mm from all other margins	
A focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia is present 1mm from medial margin(B4).
Receptors (Block B20   ): 
ER:  Strong positive (both within infiltrating duct carcinoma,NST and encysted papillary carcinoma. 
	95% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining:  strong
PR:  
	90% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensityof staining:  moderate
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 1+, negative
Ki-67 index: 10%
Nipple:  N/A
LCIS / ALH:   Focal ALH is present.
Miscellaneous:
There is a focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia (B11), greater than 10mm from all margins. Other enlarged ducts contain florid ductal hyperplasia and intraduct papilloma. These foci (eg block B12) show a mosaic pattern of keratin 5/6 expression).
There is florid usual ductal hyperplasia.
Sentinel lymph node(s):
Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 2
Number of sentinel lymph nodes involved by tumour:  0    
Number of sentinel nodes with metastases >2.0mm:   0
Number of sentinel nodes with metastases <2.0mm:  0     
	Detected by: N/A
Number of sentinel nodes with isolated tumour cells <0.2mm:       
	Detected by: N/A
Extranodal spread: N/A
Axillary/other nodes: N/A
Number of axillary lymph nodes examined: 0
Lymph node total:
Total number of lymph nodes examined (including sentinel node(s)):   2
Total number of involved lymph nodes (including sentinel node(s)):   0
Her-2 CISH is being performed and a supplementary report will be issued.

C. The entire specimen has been blocked. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS: 
A. - C. 
RIGHT BREAST: INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA WITH ADJACENT ENCYSTED PAPILLARY CARCINOMA
EXCISION APPEARS COMPLETE
HORMONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE
SENTINEL LYMPH NODES X 2 - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
