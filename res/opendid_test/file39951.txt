A-D. &amp;#160;INVASIVE BREAST CANCER SYNOPTIC REPORT
&amp;#160;
INVASIVE CARCINOMA:
&amp;#160;
NUMBER OF INVASIVE FOCI: Multifocal (2 foci separated by &amp;gt;5mm)
&amp;#160;
MAXIMUM INVASIVE TUMOUR SIZE: &amp;#160;Larger focus is 50mm, present in slices 1-7.  Smaller focus is 2.5mm, present in slice 9.
&amp;#160;
INVASIVE CARCINOMA TYPE: Multifocal invasive carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
&amp;#160;
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 2

SCORES Tubules: 3, Nuclei: 2, Mitoses: 1;  5 mitoses / 10 hpfs
&amp;#160;
WHOLE TUMOUR SIZE (INVASIVE + DCIS):  63mm (calculated from number of involved slices)
&amp;#160;
PERITUMOURAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified
&amp;#160;
PERINEURAL INVASION: Not identified
&amp;#160;
SKIN INVOLVEMENT: No skin present.

NIPPLE INVOLVEMENT: Retroareolar tissue is involved by a 7mm focus of invasive carcinoma which is present at the diathermy margin (C1).
&amp;#160;
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
There is a small amount of low grade cribriforming DCIS present within the tumour, best appreciated with immunohistochemistry slides CK5/6 and p63 in block B4.  It is limited to the tumour.

LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS): Absent&amp;#160;

EXCISION MARGINS
INVASIVE TUMOUR MARGINS:
Involves the anteromedial margin over a 2mm front (B1)
Involves the superior margin over a 2mm front (B2)
Involves the anterior margin over a 2.5mm front (B3, B4).
It is 6mm clear of the posterior margin (B6), 4mm clear of the inferior margin (B15) and &amp;gt;10 clear of the lateral margin.

DCIS MARGINS:  As for invasive tumour.
&amp;#160;
ANCILLARY TESTS: block B3
ER: &amp;#160;Positive (strong staining in 100% of cells)
PgR:  Positive (strong staining in 100% of cells) &amp;#160;
HER2: &amp;#160;0
Ki67:  15%

The tumour shows positive staining for neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin, with negative staining for CD56. There is absence of myoepithelial markers CK5/6 and p63 around the tumour nests.
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;
SEPARATE FINDINGS: There is a benign intraductal papilloma adjacent to the tumour.
The retroareolar tissue received in specimen C is involved by invasive carcinoma, which is present at the diathermy margins.

HER-2 IN-SITU HYBRIDISATION

Signal Detection has been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche).

HER2 Dual ISH result:          NEGATIVE

Mean HER2 copy number per cell:   1.8
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 1.3
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.38

SCORING CRITERIA (Updated in line with ASCO/CAP recommendations 2013):
Negative: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;lt; 4.0
Equivocal: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;gt; 4.0 and &amp;lt; 6.0
Positive: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt;2.0, Average HER2 &amp;gt; 6.0
Positive: HER2/CEP17 &amp;gt; 2.0
