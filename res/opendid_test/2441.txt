CLINICAL:
Clear cell endometrial carcinoma on curettings.  ?UTI.  Endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovary and cervix" and consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovary weighing 71.7g.  The uterus measures 65 x 40 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm.  On sectioning of the anterior and posterior body shows endometrium with 1mm thickness and myometrium up to 14mm.No convincing tumour is seen.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with an outer diameter of 7mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 30 x15 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the right ovary is unremarkable.  Left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length with an outer diameter of 5mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 28 x 15 x 10mm.  The cut surface shows calcified ill defined area measuring 7 x 5mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - further representative sections endometrium + myometrium over anterior body; 8 to 10 - full length of LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 to 15 - further blocks of endometrium ill defined area and myometrium of posterior body; 16 & 17 - right tube (16 - fimbrial end); 18 - RS right ovary; 19 & 20 - RSfallopian tube (19 - fimbrial end); 21 & 22 - all left ovary (21 - two slices pale calcified area); 
Further blocks: All of remaining endometrium embedded.23to 27 - anterior endometrium; 28 to 35 - posterior endometrium.  (TO: OM:  FC/mm 6.12.65) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic node" and consists of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 40 x 10mm.  Six lymph nodes are identifiedmeasuring from 5 to 30mm.  
Blocks: 1 - three lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node sliced into three slices; 3 - one lymph node sliced into three slices; 4 - one lymph node sliced into three slices; 5 & 6 - one lymphnode sliced into nine slices.
C.  Specimen labelled Left pelvic lymph node"" and consists of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 35 x 15mm.  Four lymph nodes are identified measuring from 10 to 40mm. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node sliced into five slices; 3 & 4 - one lymph node sliced into five slices; 5 - one lymph node sliced into three slices; 6 to 8 - one lymph node sliced into nine slices.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" and consists of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 10mm.  The cut surface shows uniform fatty tissue.  No focal lesion seen.  Representative sections embedded in block 1 & 2.   (TO: ZV; QP/ta 6/11/65) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported byDr X Retz): 
The previous report 93G59330 is noted.
A.  The entire endometrium has been examined and is inactive.  NO residual carcinoma is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
 
DIAGNOSIS:
NO residual clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium.  Ten lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
