Site_name: BALRANALD MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE
Facility_id: 016
Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Right breast lesion + sentinel lymph node.  Biopsy showed IDC.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Sentinel lymph node right axilla&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose tissue, 50 x 38 x 18mm, containing a single lymph node, measuring 30mm in maximum dimension.
Block 1 to 4 - single lymph node, sectioned.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Wide local excision right breast lesion, stitch short superior, long lateral, double deep&amp;quot;, consists of fibroadipose breast tissue with orienting sutures and hookwire in situ, weighing 49g.  The specimen measures 59mm superior to inferior, 68mm medial to lateral, and 32mm superficial to deep. The hookwire inserts into the superficial aspect of the specimen. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral into fourteen approximately equal slices.  The tip of the hookwire is present in slice two.  There is a firm, pale grey tumour in slices three to six, 13 x 10mm.  The tumour appears to be 5mm from the superficial margin and at least 10mm from all other margins.
Blocks:  1 - Slice one (medial); 2 and 3 - slice two; 4 and 5 - slice three; 6 to 8 - slice four; 9 to 11 - slice five; 12 to 14 - slice six; 15 to 17 - slice seven; 18 and 19 - slice ten; 20 and 21 - slice thirteen; 22 - slice fourteen.  See diagram.  (TO:TP/ec 25/2/67)
