CLINICAL:
WLE upper outer quadrant palpable lesion right breast.  Excised down onto fascia.  Marking sutures:  Long lateral/short superior/medium medial.  Sentinel node.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Rt sentinel node biopsy" consists of a lymph node with a small amount of fatty tissue 25mm across.  The lymph node is AE in blocks 1 & 2.
B.  Specimen labelled "Rt breast mass short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of a disc-like piece of fibrofatty tissue 40mm (from medial to lateral) x 45mm (from superior to inferior) x 15mm (from superficial to deep).  Superior superficial inked blue, inferior superficial inked green and deep resection margin inked black.  On sectioning there is an ill-defined firm area in the breast tissue measuring 20 x 7mm in slices three, four and five.  Specimen sliced from lateral to medial into eight slices.  The firm area is approaching the deep and superficial margin. It appears well clear of the superior and inferior margin.
Blocks:  1 - the transverse lateral margin; 2 - slice two; 3 & 4 - slice three; 5 & 6 - slice four; 7 & 8 - slice five; 9& 10 - slice six; 11 - slice seven; 12 - slice eight TS of the medial margin.  AE.  (WX/rt 2.7.65)
