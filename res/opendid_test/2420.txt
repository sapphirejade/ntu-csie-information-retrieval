HISTORY:  
Complex right ovarian mass. Frozen section. Right ovarian tissue. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "TISSUE RIGHT OVARY". Irregularly shaped fragments of soft yellow tissue with haemorrhage measuring 12x8x6mm. 
F/S: "Corpus luteum - negative for malignancy". Reported by Dr G Eiben by phone to anaesthetist at 12.42 hrs on 09.06.64.
(1 frozen section; 2 remainder of tissue). AE (M-2).
B. "PELVIC NODULE". Few pieces of fibrous tissue measuring in aggregate 25x20x5mm. AE (M-1/LR/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:   (Bret PORCELLI)
A.  Paraffin sections confirm the presence of a large haemorrhagic corpus luteum. There is a small amount ofadjacent ovarian cortical stroma. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Histology shows several pieces of peritonealised fibrous connective tissue, a piece of fat,further ovarian tissue containing part of a corpus luteum and a piece of  smooth muscle. Additionally there is also a focus of fibrotic partially calcified tissue containing a central area of encysted fat necrosis with numerous histiocytes and patchy chronic inflammation. This latter piece of tissue may represent an old infarcted appendix epiploicae. No evidenceof malignancy is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  TISSUE RIGHT OVARY - CORPUS LUTEUM.
B.  PELVIC NODULE - 
 - FIBROTIC CALCIFIED FAT NECROSIS (? OLD INFARCTED APPENDIX EPIPLOICAE), FURTHER OVARIAN CORTEX WITH A CORPUS LUTEUM AND PIECES OF PERITONEALISED TISSUE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
