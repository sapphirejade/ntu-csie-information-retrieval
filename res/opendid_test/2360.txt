CLINICAL:
Secondary cytoreduction, recurrent ovarian cancer.  Hypokalemia.  Hyponatremia.  Low WCC.  Stage 4 serous ovarian cancer 2054, primary cytoreduction + adjuvant chemo.  BRCA 1 positive.  Chronic anaemia.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of terminal ileum (110mm in length), proximal colon (240mm in length), appendix (70mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter) and pericolonic and ileal mesentery (up to 40mm across).  Within the pericolonic soft tissue there is a solid tumour 70 x 60 x 50mm.  The tumour invades through the wall of large bowel, with ulceration being presentin the mucosa over a 40mm area.  The tumour is 100mm fromdistal and 200mm from proximal resection margins.  The serosa over the lesion has a roughened appearance (inked green).  Thetumour has a pale yellow cut surface and appears to be necrotic within the centre.  The serosal surface of the appendix is smooth and glistening.  Its cut surface is unremarkable.  There are three smaller deposits of tumour ranging from 5 to 25mm in the adjacent fat.  There are several ?lymph nodes/?tumour deposits away from the largest tumour within the pericolonic fatty tissue.  
Blocks: 1 - shave proximal margin; 2 - shave distal margin; 3 to 5 - continuous sections extending from the ulcerated mucosa (block 3); to the roughened seroal surface (block 5); 6 - one LS tip of appendix and three TS mid appendix; 7 - section of tumour reserved block; 8 - representative smaller deposits adjacent to the larger tumour; 9 - ?lymph nodes as seen.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left iliac fossanodule", consists of a 15 x 13 x 13mm solid nodule and attached fatty tissue 15 x 12 x 3mm.  Sliced and AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Bowel suture line", consists of a ragged piece of tissue bearing bowel mucosa 27 x 14 x4mm.  No nodules are identified.  The stapled lines are removed and the remainder is embedded in 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac nodule", consists of a nodular piece of tissue 38 x 30 x 25mm.  The cut surfaces are pale and solid.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - representatives.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Jageman/Dr E Huisman):
A.  There is a 70mm deposit of metastatic high grade serous carcinoma extending from the colonic mucosa through to the subserosal fat.  Necrosis and fibrosis are seen in approximately 30% of the lesion.  Numerous mitoses, severe nuclear atypia and multifocal lymphovascular invasion are present. There aresmall clusters of tumour cells admixed with fibrin on the serosal surface. Several small nodules of tumour are seen in the adjacent pericolic fat, including a deposit involving a lymph node.
B.  The nodule is a deposit of metastatic serous carcinoma.
C.  The section shows small intestine and colon with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
D.  The section shows a lymph node which is almost completely replaced by metastatic serous carcinoma (1/1).
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right hemicolectomy:  Metastatic high grade serous carcinoma involving colon
B.  Left iliac fossa nodule:  Metastatic serous carcinoma.
C.  Bowel suture line:  No significant abnormality.
D.  Left external iliac nodule:  One lymph node with metastatic serous carcinoma (1/1).
