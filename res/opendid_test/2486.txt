Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY

CLINICAL:
Previous vulval cancer and undiff VIN.  As above.  Hx of vulval cancer 5th recurrence, currently new area of VIN 3 at peri urethra, also had radiation.
Discussed with Dr Maynard, suture is placed through the urethral orificein the excision specimen. Specimen is mostly vagina with a small amount of vulva between the vagina and urethra.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Perineal biopsy" consists of a 3mm punch bx of skin to a depth of 3mm.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1.  AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Squamous hyperplasia.  No evidence of VIN or invasive carcinoma.
Report to Dr BOBBIE Ariel by Dr V Fischman at 09:15am on 17.11.65.
B.  Specimen labelled "Anterior vaginal margin" consists of an ellipse of mucosa excision, 13 x 3 x 5mm.  The deep surface is inked blue.  On serial sectioning there is no obvious lesion present.  Serially sectioned and AE 5 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left lateral vaginal margin" consists of a rectangular shaped mucosa ellipse excision 13 x 3 x 3mm.  The specimen is serially sectioned and AE 6 blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled "Distal urethra and vagina, stitch at 12o'clock" consists of a pentagon shaped mucosa excision measuring 20 x 17 x 3mm.  At one end there is a suture denoting 12 o'clock.  Centrally, there is an irregular keratotic nodule, 10 x 10mm with surrounding pale whitearea with the total lesional area of 15 x 16mm.  The pale white area extends to both 3 and 9 o'clock margin.  3 o'clock half is inked blue and 9 o'clock half is inked black.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - TS across the lesion, serially embedded from 12 to 6 o'clock; 6 to 11 - 12 o'clock margin (serially embedded from 3 to 9 o'clock); 12 to 17 - 6 o'clock margin (serially embedded from 3 to 9 o'clock).  (TO: Frankie; ART/rt 18.11.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Briehl):
A to C. Sections show squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and irregular acanthosis.  Focal spongiosis andoccasional Civatte bodies are seen. Chronic inflammation is present in the underlying connective tissue.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
D. Sections show squamous epithelium and underlying connective tissue. There are 5 foci of well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from the vagina and distal urethra. The longest width is 1.5mm (D4) and the greatest depth is 0.9mm (D1). 
No lymphovascular or perineural spread is seen.
The squamous cell carcinoma is 0.1mm from the nearest 3 o'clock radial margin (D4), and is 1mm from the peri-urethral margin (D1). Other margins are clear.
Extensive differentiated VAIN is seen in the adjacent squamous epithelium. Differentiated VAIN is focally present at the 3 o'clock radial vaginal margin (D4). Other margins are clear.
Benign squamous hyperplasia and chronic inflammation, scarring and ulceration are also present.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to C. Perineal biopsy, anterior and left lateral margins: no evidenceof dysplasia or malignancy
D. Distal urethra and vagina:
- 5 foci of well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in vagina and urethra, longest length 1.5mm, greatest depth 0.9mm, 0.1mm 3 o'clock radial margin
- Well differentiated VAIN, focal positive 3 o'clock radial margin
