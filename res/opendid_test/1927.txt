CLINICAL:
Right mastectomy.  Prior WLE for DCIS/close margin.  Marking suture at axilla.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast marking on axillary tail" consists of a total mastectomy with a suture for orientation marking the axillary margin.  The specimen measures 220mm medial to lateral x 170mm superior to inferior x 20mm superficial to deep margin.  There is a ellipse of skin with nipple and areola complex measuring 150 x 60mm.  At 9 o'clock there is a linear scar measuring 50mm.  The rest of the skin surface is unremarkable.  Superficial margin is inked blue.  The deep margin is inked black.  On sectioning at the 9 o'clock o'clock there is an area of fibrosis measuring 40 x 30 x 10mm.  The rest of the parenchyma has fibrofatty appearance.  Representative sections.
Blocks:  1 - representative section of nipple and areola; 2 to 17 - representative sections of fibrosed area (cavity site); 18 - upper inner quadrant; 19 & 20 - lower inner quadrant; 21 & 22 - upper outer quadrant.  (TO: FO; UQ/rt 16.12.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Embleton):
Sections show breast tissue with 40 mm of intermediate grade DCIS, solid and cribriform types, adjacent to a surgical scar.  Microcalcifications are present.  No necrosis is seen.  The lesion is 2 mm from the deep margin, 6 mm from the superficial margin and is > 10 mm from the other margins.
There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
The nipple shows no evidence of Paget's disease.
The adjacent breast tissue shows fibrocystic and apocrine change.
DIAGNOSIS
Right mastectomy: 40mm intermediate grade DCIS adjacent to a surgical scar, margins clear
