Blocks: 1 to 3 - TS lesion from 3 to 9 o'clock; 4 - LS 3 o'clock margin; 5 - LS 9 o'clock margin.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Mid line back stitch 12 o'clock" consists of an ellipse of skin with the stitch marking 12 o'clock measuring 40 x 18 x 10mm.  On the centre of the skin surface a raised lesion measuring 8 x 10mm is identified.  The 3 o'clock margin inked blue, 9 o'clock black.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - TS lesion; 3 - LS 12o'clock margin; 4 - LS 6 o'clock margin.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Lateral right upper back stitch 12 o'clock"consists of an ellipse of skin with the stitch marking 12 o'clock measuring 10 x 25 x 6mm.  On the centre of the skin surface, an umbilicated skin lesion measuring 3mm is identified.  The 12 o'clock margin inked blue, 6 o'clock black.  
Blocks: 1 - TS lesion; 2 - LS 3 o'clock margin; 3 - LS 9 o'clock margin.
G.  Specimen labelled "Medial right upper back stitch 12 o'clock" consists of an ellipse of skin with the stitch marking 12 o'clock measuring 12 x 28 x 7mm.  On thecentre of the skin surface, a raised skin lesion measuring 5 x 4mm is identified.  The 12 o'clock margin inked blue, 6 o'clock black.  
Blocks: 1 - TSlesion; 2 - LS 3 o'clock margin; 3 - LS 9 o'clock margin.
H.  Specimen labelled "Right mid back stitch 12 o'clock" consists of an ellipse of skin with the stitch marking 12 o'clock measuring 15 x 30 x 8mm.  On the centre of the skin surface, a flat lesion measuring 8 x 8mm is identified.  The 12 o'clock margin inked blue, 6 o'clock black.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr C Edie):
A.  Sections show a single 2mmdeposit of malignant melanoma situated within the dermis.  The tumour cells show strong positive staining with S100 and melanA.  The HMB45 stain is focally positive and the panCK stain is negative.  The entire specimen is examined and no in situ component is identified, raising the possibility of a metastasis.  The remaining skin shows features of a seborrhoeic keratosis and actinic keratosis.  The features are as follows:
1. Site:  Left shoulder
2. Histological subtype:  Cannot be determined (possible metastasis)
3. Breslow thickness:  1.9mm.
4. Ulceration (diameter in mm):  Absent
5. Dermal mitotic rate (per mm^2):  9
6. Clark level:  IV (Reticular dermis)
7. Vascular or lymphatic invasion:  Absent
8. Neurotropism:  Absent
9. Desmoplasia (% of dermal invasive tumour):  Absent
10. Satellites:  Absent
11. Features of regression:
         Early (tumour infiltrating lymphocytes):  Present
         Intermediate (angiofibroplasia +/- tumour infiltrating lymphocytes):  Absent
         Late (fibrosis and loss of reteridges):  Absent
12. Predominent cell type: Epithelioid
13. Associated naevus:  Absent
14. Nearest lateral margin to in-situ component:  Not applicable
15. Nearest lateral margin to dermal invasive component:  4mm (6 o'clock)
16. Distance from tumour to deep margin:  5mm
17. Solar elastosis:  Present
B.  Sections show an epidermal cyst.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
C.  Sections show basal cellcarcinoma of infiltrative type penetrating the deep dermis.  No perineural invasion is seen at the advancing edge of the tumour.  Excision appears complete with a closest lateralskin margin 2.5mm clear (6 o'clock).  
D.  Sections show basal cell carcinoma of nodular type penetrating the mid dermis.  There is a small adjacent superficial multifocal component.  Excision appears complete with the closestlateral skin margin 3mm clear (6 o'clock).  
E.  Sections show superficial multifocal basal cell carcinoma.  Excision appears complete with the closest lateral skin margin 3mm clear (9 o'clock).  
F.  Sections showa seborrhoeic keratosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
G.  Sections show basal cell carcinoma of nodular type penetrating the mid dermis.  Excision appears complete with the closest lateral skin margin 3mm clear (12 o'clock).  
H.  Sections show basal cell carcinoma of noduloinfiltrative type penetrating the mid dermis.  Excision appears complete with the closest lateral skin margin 0.8mm clear (12 o'clock).  
DIAGNOSES:
A.  Left shoulder:  Malignant melanoma, possible metastasis, margins clear
B.  Left neck:  Epidermal cyst.
C.  Right shoulder:  Basal cell carcinoma, margins clear.
D.  Left mid back:  Basal cell carcinoma, margins clear.
E.  Midline back:Basal cell carcinoma, margins clear.  
F.  Lateral right upper back:  Seborrhoeic keratosis.  
G.  Medial right upper back:  Basal cell carcinoma, margins clear.
H.  Right mid back:  Basal cell carcinoma, margins clear.
