SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (3.10.2066)

CLINICAL:
Right breast invasive carcinoma.  R Axilla sentinel node biopsy.  Right breast 9 o'clock 12cm FN, 18mm invasive Ca.  11 o'clock 5cm FN.  20mm IDC.  R mastectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right axilla sentinel lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 30 x 10mm containing a lymph node 20mm in maximum dimension mainly replaced by fat.  Imprints done.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 - possible lymph nodes as seen.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
There is no evidence of malignancy found.  
Result to Dr Ngarrindjeri by Dr S Ernstrom at 8:19pm on 02/02/66.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Rightbreast long; lateral, short - superior" consists of a mastectomy measuring 280 x 220 x 85mm.  There is an ellipse of skin on the surface measuring 220 x 80mm in area containing a nipple areola complex and the skin is unremarkable.  There are two sutures orientating long lateral, short superior.  The superficial surface is inked blue and the deep black.  On sectioning there are two tumours identified.  Tumour one measures 30 x 22 x 20mm and is located at 11 o'clock, 40mm from the nipple.  This tumour is approximately 60mm from tumour two.  The margins for tumour one as follows; 20mm - deep, 80mm - superior, 20mm - superficial, 120mm - inferior, approximately 130mm - medial and 100mm- lateral. Tumour two measures 15 x 15 x 15mm and is located 8 to 9 o'clock, approximately 90mm from the nipple. The margins for tumour two are as follows:3mm - deep, 160mm - superior, 20mm - superficial, 60mm - inferior, approximately 195mm - medial and approximately80mm - lateral.  The rest of the breast tissue is predominately fibrofatty.  Please see attached diagram.  
Blocks: 1 - nippleareola complex; 2 - tissue deep to nipple; 3 - tumour one and closest deep margin; 4 to 12 - full face of tumour one (please see diagram); 13 - tissue between tumour one and tumour two; 14 & 15 - full face of tumour two;16 - inferior margin tumour two; 17 - upper inner quadrant; 18 -upper outer quadrant; 19 - lower outer quadrant; 20 - lower inner quadrant near nipple; 21 - lower inner quadrant; 22 - tumour one, tumour for bio-bank.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Level one axillary sample" consists of two piece of ragged fibrofatty tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 25mm and 60 x 40 x 15mm.  Lymph nodes are identified within the fibrofatty tissue measuring from 3 to 30mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 4 - lymph nodes as seen.
