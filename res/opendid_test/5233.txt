Vulval cancer.  SCC.  Left inguinal lymph node frozen section.   Posterior vulva, stitch at 12 o'clock right anterior margin.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left inguinal lymph node frozen section" consists of a 12mm lymph node with attached fibrofatty tissue.  Serially sectioned AE for frozen section. 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Negative for tumour.
Result to Dr Marquis Lozo (Anaesthetist) by Dr V Sengun and Dr V Reesor at 5:20pm on 03/08/66.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior vulva" consists of a posterior vulvectomy measuring 80 x 50 x10mm.  There is a suture at one edge designated 12 o'clock.  On the surface of the skin there is an ulcerated tumour 40 x 30mm in area.  The 12 o'clock margin inked blue and the 6 o'clock margin black.  Please see diagram.  The skin and tumour is AE.
Blocks: 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14, 15 & 16, 17 & 18, 19 & 20, 21 & 22, 23 & 24, 25 & 26 - paired blocks, TS from 12 to 6 o'clock from 3 to 9 o'clock.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right anterior margin" consists of a ragged piece of skin to subcutis measuring30 x 8mm to a depth of 8mm.  The specimen is unorientated.  One edge is inked blue and the opposite black.  Specimen serially sectioned and AE 4 blocks. (Blocks 1 & 4 - edges embedded on the cut surface).

Blocks: 1 -one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 to 4 - lymph nodes as seen.  
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Deep right inguinal node" consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring from 10 to 30mm each.  Lymph nodesare identified  ranging from 5 to 15mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes AE.
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned 3 - lymph nodes as seen.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Zak): 
A.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.  The tumour has a depth of 9.5mm, length of 29mm and anestimated width of 46mm.  Carcinoma extends to within 6mm of the 12 o'clock margin, 3mm of the 3 o'clock margin, 7mm of the 6 o'clock margin, 6mm of the 9 o'clock margin, and 2mm to the deep margin (block 18).No definite lymphvascular or perineural invasion is seen.  One negative lymph node is included.  
Adjacent lichen sclerosis is present.  No convincing VIN is seen.  
An incidental hidradenoma papilliferum is noted.
C.  Sections show no abnormality.  There is no evidence of VIN or malignancy.
D.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Fourteen lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Nine lymphnodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Nine lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, depth 9.5mm, length 29mm, width 46mm.  Fourty nine (49) negative lymph nodes.  (See above re margins).
