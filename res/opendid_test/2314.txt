CLINICAL:
Right abdominal wall ?desmoidtumour.  Suture at 12 o'clock.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Abdominal mass suture 12 o'clock" consists of a piece of fibromuscular soft tissue, 85 x 71 x 60mm with a suture at oneend indicating 12 o'clock.  One surface appears covered by smooth grey membranous tissue (?peritoneum).  This surface is taken as the deep aspect.  The opposite surface appears covered by fibroadipose tissue, taken as the anteriorsurface.  The margins are designated when viewed from anterior, and the 3 o'clock margin is inked green, 9 o'clock red, anterior margin blue, deep margin black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into ten slices.  Within slices three to eight is in an infiltrative tan tumour, 30 x 30 x 30mm.  The tumour appears centred within skeletal muscle.  The tumour is 10mm clear of the 3 o'clock margin, 20mm clear of the 9 o'clock margin and 1mm clear of the anterior margin.  The tumour is well clear of both the 12 and 6 o'clock margins.  
Blocks:  1 - slice one 12 o'clock margin; 2 - tumour from slice three withclosest 3 o'clock margin; 3 & 4 - cross section through tumour, slice four; 5 to 7 - full face of tumour from slice five; 8 - 9 o'clock margin from slice six; 9 - anterior and 3 o'clock margin from slice six; 10 - anterior margin from slice seven; 11 - 3 o'clock margin from slice nine; 12 - 6 o'clock margin from slice ten.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof P Magg):
Sections show a 30mm infiltrating spindled cell tumour within muscle and adipose tissue. The tumour has an intersecting fascicular architecture, with elongated pale eosinophiliccytoplasm, tapered nuclei with pin-point nucleoli. There is very mild nuclear atypia, occasional mitoses (up to 4 per 10 hpf in the most active areas) and no necrosis. No atypical mitotic figures are seen.
Degenerate muscle fibres and patchy foci of chronic inflammatory cells are present within the tumour.
The features are consistent with a fibromatosis (desmoid tumour). 
Beta catenin staining shows weak cytoplasmic staining as well as scattered, moderately positive tumour nuclei.
The margins appear clear and are asfollows: Anterior 1mm; Deep 1mm (The deep margin has an intact fascial plane); 3 o'clock 2.5mm; and the 9 o, 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins well clear >10mm.
Dr P Phatdouang has also reviewed the sections of tumour and anterior margin. There is an area of fascial disruption, fat necrosis and haemosiderin deposition (possibly corresponding to a previous core biopsy) in block 10. Deeper levels and beta catenin staining have been performed on this section. 
Tumour merges with fascia and scar tissue at this point but the margin appears clear by1 - 2mm. 
DIAGNOSIS:
ABDOMINAL WALL: 30mm FIBROMATOSIS (desmoid tumour) infiltrating muscle and adipose tissue.
Margins appear clear.
