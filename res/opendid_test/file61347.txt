MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of uterus with attached cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries. Anterior is inked blue, posterior is black. The adnexal tissue is separated from the main specimen. The uterus with attached cervix together weighs 292g and measures 110mm superior to inferior, 65mm intercornual distance, ectocervix is 30x20mm with a slit-like os 5mm. It is cream coloured and centrally has a brownish somewhat haemorrhagic appearance. Inferior endomyometrium is 25mm, posterior endomyometrium is bulged by a nodule with a pale white whorled appearance consistent with a fibroid. Including the fibroid it measures 60mm. The intramural fibroid is 65x60x42mm. The endometrium is extensively replaced by a tumour with infiltration into the myometrium and extension involving the cervical stromal tissue. Anteriorly, the tumour occupies 22mm of 25mm anterior endomyometrial thickness and posteriorly is up to 13mm of 60mm endometrial thickness. The tumour extends inferiorly into the cervical stroma and is close to the cervical margins. It measures 75mm superior to inferior x 50mm left to right. The tumour is 2mm from the free serosal surface but does not appear to infiltrate it. In the cervix it is less than 1mm from anterior and posterior margins. Representative sections are taken.
(1 right parametrial tissue; 2 left parametrial tissue; 3 right cornual; 4 left cornual; 5 tumour in relation to anterior cervix margin; 6 tumour in relation to posterior cervix margin; 7-20 full face sagittal slice [7 anterior and posterior cervix; 8 anterior and posterior lower uterine segment; 9-11 anterior endomyometrium; 12-20 posterior endomyometrium including fibroid]; 21 further section of anterior cervix including tumour; 22 further section of posterior cervix including tumour; 23-25 sections of tumour in relation to anterior endomyometrium ?deepest myometrial extent).
The right ovary and fallopian tube together weighs 6g. Fallopian tube measures 33mm in length with a maximum diameter of 6mm. Ovary is 30x20x15mm. Serosal surface is unremarkable. On sectioning through the ovary, it has a firm cut surface with occasional cysts with smooth inner lining. Some are pale with gelatinous material.
(26 right fallopian tube; 27 representative section of right ovary).
The left ovary and fallopian tube together weighs 7g. Fallopian tube measurse 35mm in length with a maximum diameter of 9mm. The ovary is 25x25x15mm. The serosal surface is smooth. On sectioning through the ovary, it has a firm cut surface with occasional cysts filled with gelatinous material. Representative sections are taken.
(28 left fallopian tube; 29 and 30 representative sections of left ovary). Representative sections (M-30)
B. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 35x20x9mm. Two possible lymph nodes are identified.
(1 one node, bisected; 2 one possible node, bisected; 3 remainder fatty tissue). All embedded. (M-3)
C. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC LYMPH ODE&amp;quot;. A piece of fatty tissue, it measures 35x15x6mm. One possible node is present, bisected. All embedded. (M-1)
D. &amp;quot;OMENTUM&amp;quot;. A piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 120x100x20mm. The fibrous appearing section appears to be adherent peritoneum with focal suspicious area within the peritoneal tissue ?tumour. On sectioning, the remainder of the fatty tissue no obvious lesion is identified. Representative sections are taken.
(1 and 2 sections include focal suspicious area within attached peritoneum; 3 further section of fibrofatty tissue). Representative sections (M-3/MC 13/7/2070 cy)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr. R. Kreisman)
A.   The sections show a carcinosarcoma of the endometrium which extends to involve the entire endometrial cavity and into the cervix where it is seen to ulcerate through the ectocervix (A22).   The carcinomatous component comprises about 95% of the tumour and shows varying pattern of high grade serous-like glandular slit-like spaces and papillae,  clear cell change, solid and a more primitive-appearing sheet-like area with increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (A10).   The sarcomatous component is approximately 5% of the tumour. It  is seen as a nodule in the posterior cervical stroma (A6) and is composed of spindle cells with foci of heterologous cartilagenous differentiation.   There is another pure spindle cell focus of sarcoma in the uterine body (A10).  The tumour widely invades into the outer half of the myometrium and comes within 3mm of the serosa. (A3) Tumour also widely invades into the cervical stroma (A6).  Lymphovascular invasion is seen  (A7, A9, A23).

ANCILLARY STUDIES/IMMUNOSTAINS:
Epithelial (serous like ) component:

- negative for p53 (complete loss), WT1, chromogranin, PR.

Primitive epithelial component:
- positive for AE1/3(patchy), p16, WT1 (patchy), focal synaptophysin
- negative for p53 (complete), Vim, chromo, ER, PR.

Spindle cell (sarcomatous) component:
- positive for Vim, p16, weak patchy positive for WT1,
- negative for p53, synaptophysin, AE1/3 (only occasional weakly positive cells).

Mismatch repair proteins:
MLH1 - positive (retained) nucleus staining.
PMS2 - positive (retained) nucleus staining.
MSH2 - positive (retained) nucleus staining.
MSH6 - positive (retained) nucleus staining.
Comment:  Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 AND MSH6 is the wild type staining pattern and indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE CLASSIFICATION (pTNM, AJCC 8th ed):
pT2: Tumour invades cervical stroma.
pN1mi: Regional lymph node metastasis (greater than 0.2 mm but not greater than 2 mm in diameter) to pelvic lymph nodes.
