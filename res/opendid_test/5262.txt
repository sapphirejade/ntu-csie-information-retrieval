HISTORY:  
Right colon peritonectomy, appendix ca. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
"GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE". Received multiple pieces of tissue in one jar including:
A gallbladder measuring 85x40mm. A staple is noted on the cystic duct. The outer surface is smooth and grey blue in colour. A thickened fibrous like material is identified at the fundus. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosal surface is green and granular. Bile is present in the lumen. The cut surface of the firm fibrous area at the fundus reveals possible white deposits 5mm in maximum diameter. No calculi are identified. Two pericystic lymph nodes are identified, the largest 12mm with unremarkable cut surfaces. 
(1 cystic duct and larger pericystic lymph node trisected; 2 two TS neck and smaller pericystic lymph node; 3 two TS body; 4two LS fundus with fibrous areas).
A segment of bowel including small bowel 105x30mm, possible anastomosis line and adjacent large bowel 90x80mm. Mesentery and mesocolon are attached along the specimen to a maximum width of40mm. Attached also a fibrous piece of tissue consistent with peritoneum measuring 230x70x10mm and attached muscle measuring 65x35x30mm. Possible piece of omentum is attached 80x45x20mm. The serosal surface is extensively haemorrhagic,ragged with multiple adhesions. There is a hard nodular area measuring 35mm in maximum diameter appearing to have an extensively mucinous cut surface. It is involving the adjacent mesocolon but not involving the underlying mucosa macroscopically. The mucosa is unremarkable with no tumour identified. Similar hard firm nodules are identified on the peritoneal surface and skeletal muscle (up to ten nodules), the largest measuring 10mm in maximum diameter. 
(5proximal resection margin; 6 distal resection margin; 7 anastomosis; 8 nodular areas on large and small bowel; 9&10 largest mucinous nodule; 11 firm areas on smooth muscle; 12 firm area on peritoneum; 13 ?nodule omentum; 14 four lymph nodes).
A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum measuring  220x90x35mm with multiple haemorrhagic and fibrous areas. No definite tumour nodules are identified representative of the firm areas. 
(15-19 firmareas of omentum).
Received multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue measuring  90x70x10mm in aggregate. Part of the fragments are covered by glistening surface (?peritoneum) with one possible nodule is identified in one piece witha firm white cut surface.
(20 firm nodule bisected; 21&22 RS remainder tissue). RS (M-22/XS/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr U Hubbartt)
Sections of gallbladder show features of mild to moderate chronic cholecystitis.  The two cystic duct lymph nodes show reactive changes only. Fibrous adhesions are present on the serosa of the fundus.  There is no extracellularmucin within the gallbladder wall or on the serosal surface, and no atypical epithelium is seen.  
Sections of large and small intestine show unremarkable distal and proximal resection margins.  A section from the anastomosis shows suture granulomas, but no tumour is identified.  Fibrous serosal adhesions are noted.  Sections of the mucinous serosal nodule show extensive dystrophic calcification.  The nodule is composed largely of extracellular mucin but contains a few strips of mucin secreting epithelium with high grade nuclei, and occasional signet ring cells. Occasional small malignant appearing glands are present with a desmoplastic stroma, consistent with high grade mucinous adenocarcinoma (block 10).  Immunohistochemical stains for keratin CAM5.2, CK20, and CDX2 are positive, while  TTF-1, CK7  and PAX8 are negative. These results are in keeping with a gastrointestinal primary site.  
Sections of the skeletal muscle show fibrous adhesions, but no extracellular mucin or atypical epithelium is identified.  Sections of the firm areas on the peritoneum also show fibrous adhesions, with no extracellular mucin or atypical epithelium.
of omentum show eight lymph nodes with mild reactive changes only.  Sections of the peritoneum show no lymph nodes, no extracellular mucin and no atypical epithelium.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE :
-SEROSAL NODULE OF MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING THE INTESTINAL SPECIMEN.  
-MULTIPLE FIBROUS SEROSALADHESIONS.
-EIGHT OMENTAL LYMPH NODES SHOW MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
-MULTIPLE FIBROUS SEROSAL ADHESIONS INVOLVING GALLBLADDER, SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM.
-TWO CYSTIC DUCT LYMPH NODES SHOW REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (5/9/66):

Supplementary report: 
Immunostains for MSI proteins (American International Group TULLY HOSPITAL Lab; block:10)
MLH1: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei.
PMS2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei.
MSH2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei.
MSH6: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei.
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihoodof microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation ofspecimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
