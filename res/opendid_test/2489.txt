Distribution:  

CLINICAL:
Ca125 - 129.  Frozen section right fallopian tube and ovary.  Bilateral pelvic mass.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of an ovary 90 x 70 x 60mm.  There is overlying fallopiantube 50 x 6 x 6mm.  The ovarian surface is intact.  The ovary contains a multiloculated cyst with papillary excrescences.  A small amount of residual ovary is seen.
Blocks:1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 - fallopian tube; 4 to 12 - RS cyst.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an ovary 65 x 50 x 40mm.  There is overlying fallopian tube 40 x 5 x 5mm.  Halfof the ovarian surface is covered by papillary excrescences.  The ovary contains a multiloculated cyst with a 10mm nodule.
Blocks:  1 - surface papillary excrescences for frozen section; 2 - solid nodule for frozen section; 3 - fallopian tube; 4 to 10 - RS cyst.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT(A & B):
Bilateral borderline serous tumour.
Result to Dr Titus byDr Jame REGAL at 11am on 19.04.2065.
C.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of a uterus with cervix 95 x 65 x 60mm, weighing 137g.  The ectocervix is 45 x 45mm.  The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometriumis up to 26mm thick and appears somewhat trabeculated.  Two intramural fibroids are seen both 5mm across.  The serosa appears smooth and shiny.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 9 - fibroids.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 40 x 15 x 5mm.  No nodules are identified.  AE 2 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 15x 10 x 5mm.  No nodules are identified.  Bisected.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic peritoneum" consists of a piece of grey tissue 15 x 5 x 5mm.  No nodules are seen.  Bisected.  AE 1 block.
.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" consists of three pieces of tan tissue 2 - 4mm across.  AE 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum 130 x 60 x 10mm.  No nodules are seen.  RS in 3 blocks.  (TO: OO; MK/rt 20.4.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Fattore):
A. Sections of the ovary show a borderline serous tumour.  There is a multiloculated cyst composed of branching papillae lined by columnar serous tumour cells with mild to focally moderate nuclear atypia.  No surface serosal involvement is present.  There is no evidence of malignancy.The fallopian tube appears unremarkable.
B. Sections of the ovary show a borderline serous tumour with surface serosal involvement.  The lesion has a similar morphology to the left ovarian lesion. There is no evidence of malignancy.  The fallopian tube appears unremarkable.
C. Sections from the posterior uterine body show focal endosalpingiosis on the serosal surface.  There are scattered glands lined by tubal type epithelium, admixed with psammomabodies and granulation tissue.  Benign leiomyomas are present in the myometrium.  The endometrium is in mid secretory phase.  The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN. There is no evidence of malignancy.
D and E.  Sections show peritoneum with focal endosalpingiosis.  There is no evidence of tumour implantation or malignancy.
F. Sections at multiple levels show fibroadipose tissue with no significant abnormality.
G. Sections show fibrin admixed with organising granulation tissue, mesothelial hyperplasia and scattered psammoma bodies. There is no evidence of tumourimplantation or malignancy.
H. Sections show omental fat with no evidence of tumour implantation or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Left ovary and fallopian tube: borderline serous tumour
B. Right ovary and fallopian tube: borderline serous tumour with surface serosal involvement
C. Uterus and cervix: endosalpingiosis 
D and E. Right and left paracolic gutter: endosalpingiosis
F. Pelvic peritoneum: no abnormality detected
G. Sigmoid colon nodule: organising granulation tissue with mesothelial hyperplasia and psammoma bodies
H. Omental biopsy: no abnormality detected
