HISTORY:  
Hx of perforated appendix cancer. Peritonectomy. 
- Ileocolic (Rt hemicolectomy Redo)
- Omentum
- Peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:  
"RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM + PERITONEAL DISEASE". Consists of right colon with anastomosis between large and small bowel. A piece of omentum, small segment of small bowel and piece of peritoneal tissue. Right hemicolectomy specimen measures 300mm in length with a length of the large bowel being 110mm. The length of the small bowel being 190mm. The circumference of the small bowel is up to 55mm and the circumference of the large bowel is up to 85mm. Onexamination of the specimen, there are no obvious lesions seen. However, the serosa of the small and large bowel and the mesentery appears uneven. There are six lymph nodes identified on the mesentery, measuring from 4 up to 8mm in maximalextent. Representative sections are taken and embedded.
(1 proximal surgical margin; 2 distal surgical margin; 3,4,5&6 representative sections of the small bowel with granular serosa; 7&8 representative sections of the serosa of the small bowel; 9,10&11 representative sections of the large bowel with uneven serosa; 12 one lymph node sectioned transversely; 13 three lymph nodes; 14 two lymph nodes).
There is separate piece of small bowel, measuring 40mm in length with circumference up to 43mm. There are no obvious deposits of tumour identified. The specimen was sectioned longitudinally to full face, longitudinal sections are taken and embedded.
(15 section one; 16 section two). 
There is separate piece of omentum, measuring 190x70x20mm. On the sectioning, there are no obvious lesions identified. Representative sections are taken and embedded in four blocks.
(17-20 representative sections of omentum).
There is separate piece of peritoneum, measuring 110x40x20mm. Representative sections are taken and embedded in four blocks.
(21-24 representative sections of the mesentery). RS (M-24/ QL/cy)


MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr G Gannaway)  
Sections through the right colon anastomosed to small bowel, separately submitted small bowel segment, omentum and peritonealfragments show evidence of previous surgery with fibrous adhesions and foreign body granulomatous reaction to suture material. Lymph nodes recovered from the right hemicolectomy specimen and from the omentum show reactive changes. residual tumour is seen in any of the sections examined. 
There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM AND PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- FIBROUS ADHESIONS AND FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMATOUS REACTION TO SUTURE MATERIAL. NO RESIDUAL TUMOUR IDENTIFIED.
