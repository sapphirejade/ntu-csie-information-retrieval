HISTORY:  
Bilateral pelvic masses.  CA 125-40.  Temporal arthritis.
Peritoneal washings. Right tube + tube.  Left ovary + tube.
Bilateral ovarian masses.  Uterovesical peritoneum.  Uterus + cervix.  Omentum.  Appendix.  Right pelvic lymph nodes.  Left pelvic lymph node.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "LEFT OVARY + TUBE".  Frozen section was done for specimen A and B.  Consists of ovary and tube.  The ovary measures 60x45x35mm.  Appears lobulated and solid.  The fallopian tube measures 35mm in length with diameter up to 6mm.  The specimen weighs 40g.  
(1 FS; 2-6 RS of the left ovary; 7 RS of the left fallopian tube including fimbrialend). RS (M-7
B.  "RIGHT OVARY + TUBE".  Lobulated mass with attached fallopian tube. The mass measures 85x70x50mm.  The specimen weighs 92g.  The fallopian tube appears fragmented and measures about 40mm in length x a diameter of about 5mm.  The ovary was sectioned.  On sectioning it appears solid with probably formation of the cystic structure.  
(1 FS; 2-6 RS of the right ovary from 2-6; 7 RS of the right fallopian tube".  RS (M-7)
/S (A&B) : High grade poorly differentiated malignancy.  ? serous ? carcinoma".  Reported to Dr. Elliott KEVER at 1052Hrs on 30.3.66 by Dr. X. Mcnelley.
C.  "UTERUS + CERVIX".  Uterus with cervix measuring 83x50x32mm. Thespecimen weighs 80g.  Anterior surgical margin is inked blue, posterior is black. The specimen is sectioned longitudinally.  The endometrium is about 1mm in thickness. The myometrium measures about 17mm in thickness. The specimen was sectioned. There are few fibroids identified within the fundus measuring from 4 up to 17mm in diameter.  
(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 anterior body; 4 posterior body; 5 anterior fundus; 6 posterior fundus).  RS (M-6)
D.  "OMENTUM".  Omentum measuring 260x110x10mm.  There are no obvious lesions seen within the specimen.  On sectioning no lesions identified.  RS (M-4)
E.  "APPENDIX".  Appendix measuring 45mm in length with diameter up to 4mm. The serosa of the appendix looks smooth and shiny.  There is no oedema.  
(1 distal appendix; 2 proximal appendix).  RS (M-2)
F.  "UTEROVESICAL PERITONEUM".  Piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30x5x3mm.  AE (M-1)
G.  "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE".  Piece of fatty tissue measuring 25x20x5mm and containing two nodes measuring 5 and 10mm in diameter.  
(1 larger lymph node sectioned transversely; 2 smaller lymph node; 3 rest of the fatty tissue).  AE (M-3)
H.  "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE".  Piece of possible lymph node measuring 15mm in maximal extent.  The specimen was sectioned and all embedded in one block.  AE (M-1EZ/ank)
