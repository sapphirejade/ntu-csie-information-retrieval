CLINICAL:
Previous biopsy cervix.  Suspicious for SCC.  Cervical biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen unlabelled as to site or nature, consists of a cervical biopsy 7mm and several small fragments.  Large fragment bisected.  AE 2 blocks. 
(FM/vo 13.1.66) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Farrel):
Sections show mainly endocervical glandular mucosa with only asmall amount of squamous mucosa.  The glandular component shows complex architecture with the glandular epithelium showing nuclear stratification, hyperchromasia, mitosis and apoptotic bodies.  These features are associated with an acutely inflamed stroma.  The appearances are consistent with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), with focal areas suspicious for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  The squamous component shows features of HPV effect and CIN2.  No invasive squamous component is seen. 


DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterine cervix:  
- Adenocarcinoma in situ, suspicious for invasive adenocarcinoma.
- CIN2, HPV.
