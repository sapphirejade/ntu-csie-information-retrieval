CLINICAL:
Metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease.  D & C performed 6/5/65  GTD.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix and bilateral tubes", consists of a uterus with attached fibroids and bilateral tubes weighing 78g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in maximum thickness.There is no obvious lesion within the endometrial cavity.  On the right anterior endometrium the endometrium is irregularly thickened with a thickness of 5mm (block 7).  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter.  (TO:Hassan;Boy/ta 12/11/65).  Within the right posterior cervical stroma is a haemorrhagic area, 10 x 8 x 15mm (blocks 58 to 70).  (TO: Zane; EDDIE/rt 12.11.65)
Blocks: 1 to 3 - left anterior endometrium; 4 to 6 - anterior body and cervix (midline); 7 to 9 - right anterior endometrium; 10 and 11 - right posterior endometrium; 12 to 14 - posterior body and cervix (mid line); 15 to 19 - left posterior endometrium.  The endometrium is AE; 20 - right fimbriae end; 21 - right tube RS; 22- left fimbriae end; 23 - left tube RS (TO: Morris;Kory/vo 11.11.65) 24 to 26 - right anterior lateral wall cornua; 27 & 28 - (composite sections) left anterior wall; 29 & 30 - left anterior wall cornua ridging; 31 to 34 - left posterior lower uterine segment; 35 & 36 - (composite sections) left lateral wall; 37 - left posterior lateral wall; 38 & 39 - right posterior lateral wall cornua ridging (composite sections); 40 & 41 - posterior right lateral wall; 42 to 50 - remaining lower uterine segments; 51 & 52 - the fundus myometrium remaining.  The uterine cavity is AE.  (TO:Gus;Thanh/ta 12/11/65) 53 to 71 - the cervix AE; 72 & 73 - tubes (72 - the left tube; 73 - the remainder of the right tube.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Holle):
The entire specimen has been embedded.
In a large vein near the right cornu, there is a single large 4 mm villus with an irregular outline, oedematous stroma, surrounded by trophoblast, consistent with residual viable complete mole.
At the right lateral uterus/cornu, multiple acellular areas of sclerosis are seen in the myometrium and large veins, over a 30mm area, consistent with treatment effect.
A 12mm area of necrosis and organising haemorrhage is seen in the right posterior cervix, consistent with treatment effect.
The endometrium appears atrophic with tubal metaplasia present.
The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN.
The fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes:
	Single 4mm focus of viable complete mole in a large vein near the right cornu
	Multifocal sclerosis over a 30mm area, right lateral uterus/cornu, consistent with treatment effect
	12mm area of necrosis/organising haemorrhage, right posterior cervix, consistent with treatment effect
