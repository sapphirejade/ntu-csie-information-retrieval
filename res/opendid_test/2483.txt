SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (1.12.2065)

CLINICAL:
?Inflammation/?infection/?tumour.  Laparotomy.  Pelvic mass (priorbiopsies ?low grade liposarcoma).  Multiple abdominal collections.  Hypertension.  Pelvic mass with large abscess cavity, frozen section c/w adenocarcinoma.  
1.  Pelvic mass with rectosigmoid ?primary adenocarcinoma.  2.  Appendiceal stump ?primary adenocarcinoma.  2.  Wall of upper abdominal abscess cavity.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "?Inflammation ?tumour" consists of a piece of tan soft tissue, 12mm across.  AE frozen section in 1 block.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma.  
Phone result to (anaesthetist) DrChristian by Dr D Bockhorn/Dr D Meenach at 4pm on 07.04.65
B.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon/pelvic tumour" consists of a segment of large bowel 300mm in length and varying circumference.  At one end of the bowel is a stapledmargin, and the bowel is 90mm circumference.  The opposite stapled margin is shorter and appears to be submucosal, and the bowel at this end of 55mm circumference.  There is minimal attached mesocolon, 20mm in width.  
Within the mid section of the colon there is an adhesion between adjacent colon segments.  In the bowel adjacent to this adhesion there is a circumferential exophytic tan tumour, 70mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour is 120mm clear of the closest stapled margin.  The tumour perforates through the entire bowel wall thickness, with a transmural defect, 25 x 20mm.  Surrounding this defect there are serosal deposits of tan necrotic tumour, spanning an area 90mm across (inked black).  There is a large area of necrosis and probable tumour in the mesocolic fat which is entrapped between the adherent loops of bowel.
On the opposite serosal surface, also adjacent to the bowel adhesion there is haemorrhagic and fibrinousexudate 60 x 25mm.  Within the bowel there are two pedunculated mucosal polyps, both 7mm across. These polyps are at least 30mm clear of the closet stapled margin.  
There is deposition of haemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate adjacentto the end of bowel near the first stapled margin.  This area is 40mm across, and 25mm clear of the margin.  Haemorrhagic serosal deposits are also seen near the shorter stapled margin.  Lymph nodes are difficult to identify within the mesocolon.  No apical lymph node is identifiable.  Also received are multiple fragments of necrotic tumour 60mm in aggregate.   
Blocks:  1- bowel at stapled margin; 2 & 3 - two mucosal polyps; 4 & 5 - edge of tumour with uninvolvedbowel; 6 to 8 - bowel with tumour at site of perforation; 9 - tumour with adherent loops of bowel; 10 - tumour at site of bowel perforation; 11 - necrosis in mesocolon between adherent loops of bowel; 12 - opposite stapled margin; 13 - bowel with haemorrhagic serosal deposits near first staple margin; 14 & 15 - haemorrhagic serosal deposits near shorter stapled margin; 16 - one lymph node; 17 - multiple lymph nodes.  Specimen photograph taken; 18 to 26 - pericolicfat. 
C.  Specimen labelled "?Appendix" consists of an appendix received partially opened.  The appendix is 60mm in length and 17mm diameter.  There appears to be haemorrhagic tissue over the serosa.  The wall is 3mm thick.The lumen contains haemorrhagic material.  No focal lesions are seen within the appendix.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - LS through distal/tip of appendix; 4 to 9 - TS serially embedded from tip towards base; 10 - shave TS appendix adjacent to stapled margin.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Upper abdominal abscess" consists of a piece of soft tissue 45 x 35 x 5mm.  There appears to be fibrinous exudate over one surface.  AE 4 blocks.  (TO: MS:  JF/mm 7.4.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by A/Prof D Tomka):  
The tumour was re-examined after assessment of the initial sections and extensive additional sampling of the pericolic fat was performed.
There is a circumferential moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which has perforated through the wall of the colon. Adenocarcinoma is also present on the appendix (Specimen C) and within the wall of the upper abdominal abscess (Specimen D). A synoptic report is as follows:

Macroscopic Description

Maximum tumour diameter:   70  mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  120 mm
Tumour perforation:     Yes (pT4)
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Immunohistochemistry: CK7 Negative, CK 20 Positive, CDX2 Positive.

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT4b	Tumour directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: 3	
Number of lymph nodes involved: 1
The specimen was re-examined and extensive sampling of the mesocolon was conducted. No further lymph nodes were identified in the additional sections.	
pN1a	Metastases in 1 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (Mural / Extramural) / Absent
Perineural invasion
Present - within deep layers of colonic wall (B7).
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pM1	Distant metastasis confirmed	Site: Appendix
Background abnormalities/other comments
There are two tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia
Other: Chronic changes consistent with perforation are seen within the mesocolon, containing necrotic debris, inflammation and organic material encased within fibrous tissue. At the site of perforation, viable tumour is present.
The serosal deposits consist of densefibrous stoma, with foamy macrophages, reactive fibroblasts and granulation vessels. This is consistent with previous chemoradiotherapy effect.
The appendix (Specimen C) shows adenocarcinoma infiltrating into the muscularis propria.
The upper abdominal abscess (Specimen D) shows fibrous tissue, with foamy macrophages, chronic inflammatory cells and occasional giant cells. There are small residual cords of adenocarcinoma within the fibrotic tissue. This is consistent with partial chemoradiotherapy effect. 
The reports of the previous biopsies of retroperitoneum are noted (General Mills report 18K81163 and CANOWINDRA SOLDIERS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Hospital report DW38116331). The core biopsy from MONA VALE HOSPITAL has been obtained and reviewed in association with the current resection specimen.
Within the pericolic fat in the current resection there are areas of fat necrosis and reactive changes with variability in lipocyte size and focal nuclear hyperchromasia. There is associated fibrosis, inflammatory infiltration and aggregates of histiocytes. When seen in the broader context of the colonic resection these changes are consistent with inflammatory and reactive changes due toabscess formation. 
These changes are similar to those seen in the previous biopsy and may account for the previous interpretation of atypia. 
Residual tumour status
R2	Macroscopic margin involvement
Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Grade 3 (poor response) -Minimal or no tumour kill; extensive residual cancer
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclearstaining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY REPORT
REPORT
MUTATION ANALYSIS IN DNA EXTRACTED FROM TUMOUR

CLINICAL INFORMATION: KRAS mutation testing(Oncofocus Panel). Adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon. KRAS testing on histopathology done on 7/4/65 at GOOMALLING HOSPITAL. Metastatic colorectal cancer, currently having chemotherapy. Sigmoid colon: Adenocarcinoma with perforation and involvement of theappendix; pT4b pN1 pM1.
Nature of specimen: Sigmoid colon resection 
Date of biopsy: 7/4/65
Pathology lab: ArvinMeritor
Accession number: 18K81163 B7
MATERIAL PROVIDED: The H&E section shows large bowel containing adenocarcinoma measuring 15 x 10mm. On the whole section tumour represents approximately 40%of the section. In the region selected for macro-dissection, tumour cells comprise 60% of cellular material.
Please note that the purpose of this assessment is purely to determine if lesional material is present and adequate for molecular testing and does not constitute a formal pathology review.
RESULTS: KRAS G13D/N* MUTATION DETECTED

*this assay cannot distinguish between these mutations
THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION: Multiple studies have shown that patients with tumours harbouring mutations in KRAS are unlikely to benefit from anti-EGFR antibody therapy (Ref: Bardelli & Siena, J Clin Oncol 2010;28: 1254-1261).
TEST DESCRIPTION:
This test profiles a broad range of somatic mutations from 4 common oncogenes (BRAF, EGFR, KRAS and NRAS) using OncoFOCUSTM with additional custom panel. This multi-gene parallel profiling is intended to assist the selection of targeted therapies for cancer patients. Mutation analysis is performed on DNA isolated from tumour tissue. The relevant target regions are amplified in 2 multiplex PCR reactions followed by 12 multiplex extensions. Any mutant allele is accurately identified by mass spectrometry. Any reported mutation is called with high confidence (i.e. the proportion of a mutant allele is 10%or more). This oncogene panel can detect over 300 mutations including the following clinically relevant mutations in the EGFR (NM_005228), KRAS (NM_004985), BRAF (NM_004333) and NRAS (NM_002524) genes. For a full list of the mutations tested, please see http://agenabio.com/oncofocus-panel.

COMMENT:
*	Samples can contain a variable proportion of tumour cells to normal cells and there may also be tumour cell heterogeneity. If tumour cells represent less than 20% of the cells analysed the sensitivity of the assay may be reduced.
*	All PCR based molecular diagnostic tests are subject to a low risk of non-amplification of one allele due to primer binding site DNA variants. This can also lead to a false negative result.
*	The laboratory assumes an appropriate form of consent has been obtained.
