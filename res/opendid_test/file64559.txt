Maximum tumour diameter: 33mm
Perforation:  Absent (surgical defect repaired with suture, site inked red)
Appearance of serosa overlying tumour: (see above)
Distance of tumour to proximal cut end: 95mm

Distance of tumour to circumferential margin: Greater than 70mm

Other
Polyps: None identified

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Ingwerson):

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
T2    Invasion into muscularis propria (6)

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:   Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  5mm (4)

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  19
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1

N1a   Metastases in 1 regional LN

Lymphovascular invasion
Present (mural)

Perineural invasion
Absent

Tumour budding
Bd3 (high):  &amp;gt;= 10 buds per 0.785 sq mm

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX    Cannot be assessed histologically

Background abnormalities/other comments
- The lesion is arising from a tubulovillous adenoma.
- The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the lumen.

Residual tumour status
R0    No residual tumour

Response to neoadjuvant therapy
Not applicable

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1    Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2    Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2    Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6    Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:  Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry
Not performed
