CLINICAL:
Endometrial hyperplasia.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 155g in total.  The uterus measures 98 x 68 x 40mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 32 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There are two polypoid endometrial masses 15 x 9 x 9 and 15 x 8 x 6mm.  The remainder of the endometrium is 4mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is up to 25mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains five fibroids ranging from 5 to 20mm.  All fibroids have pale, solid cut surfaceswith no necrosis.  The right ovary measures 42 x 35 x 38mm and has a smooth, external surface.  The right ovary has a vaguely lobulated yellow, solid cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 52mm in length and up to 9mm in diameter.  Theleft ovary measures 32 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 55mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (7 & 8 - are paired); 10 - 21 - more sections of endomyometrium; 22 to 25 - sections of the right ovary; 26 - representatives right fallopian tube; 27 - representative left ovary; 28 - representative left fallopian tube.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Liberatore):
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium shows extensive complex hyperplasia with and without cytological atypia.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas and adenomyosis.  The right ovary shows a benign fibroma.  The left ovary and both tubes are unremarkable.   There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes:  Extensive complex hyperplasia with and without cytological atypia, leiomyomas, adenomyosis, right ovarian fibroma.
