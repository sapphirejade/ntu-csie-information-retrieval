HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
GOVE DISTRICT HOSPITAL AND SUTHERLAND HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
R pelvic side wall intraop peritonectomy.  Frozen section.  Peritonectomy frozen section small bowel, mesenteric mass, peritonectomy, omentum, rectum, diaphragm strip (partial right), vaginal stump, left pelvic mass.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SIDE WALL&amp;quot;.  Consists of pink fibrous tissue 20x8x3mm.  One area slightly firm measuring 2mm in maximum diameter.  One TS of the firm area and other RS transverse section was taken for frozen section.

F/S : &amp;quot;Fibrous tissue.  No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot;. Reported to Dr. Terence (Liver Reg) by Dr. G. Hussian at 11:30 am on 20.09.68.

(1 FS; 2 remainder firm area; 3 remainder tissue).  AE (M-3)

B.  &amp;quot;MESENTERIC MASS&amp;quot;. Consists of fatty tissue 25mm in maximum diameter with a pale firm lymph node 20mm in maximum diameter. Two TS taken for frozen section.

&amp;quot;Lymph node positive for carcinoma (adenocarcinoma)&amp;quot;. Reported to Dr. Tom (Liver Reg) by Dr. G. Jabbie at 2:10 pm on 20.09.68.

(1 FS; 2&amp;amp;3 remainder tissue). AE (M-3)

C.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, RECTOSIGMOID, GALLBLADDER, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Received within one specimen jar multiple tissue fragments including:

A gallbladder 60x35mm with unremarkable outer surface.  The wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosal surface is green and granular. No calculi are identified.

(1 cystic duct and TS neck; 2 TS body and LS fundus)

A segment of small bowel 190x40mm with mesentery up to 35mm.  Multiple ragged and haemorrhagic areas are identified on the wall and mesentery of small bowel measuring 5-10mm in maximum diameter and has mucoid cut surface.  No definite discrete tumours are identified.  No intraluminal polyps or tumours are seen.

(3 LS of each peripheral edge; 4&amp;amp;5 RS ragged areas)

A fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum 300x200x35mm.  A solid firm omentum caking in multiple areas of the omentum are identified consists of 20% of the submitted omentum.  Largest area measures 90x50x30mm with firm white and yellow cut surface. The other areas variable between 20mm and 25mm.

(6-8 TS of the largest deposit with block 7 for tumour block for tissue banking; 9 RS smaller deposit)

A rectosigmoid segment of bowel measuring 250x40mm with attached mesocolon and mesorectum up to 80mm and has multiple peritoneal strips measuring 145x75x15mm and 120x60x15mm.  At the edge of one peritoneal strip there is a glistening surface (? mucosa) 25x20mm.  Multiple tumour deposits are identified involving the serosal surfaces, the peritoneal strips at the peritoneal reflection and is extensively involving the mesocolon and mesorectal fat. The largest mass is located just below the anterior peritoneal reflection 60x40x30mm.  It is pushing the wall of the large bowel but no mucosal involvement is identified.  The mucosa has no polyps or tumours.  The mesocolon resection margin is inked blue.

(10 proximal margin; 11 distal margin; 12&amp;amp;13 tumour with the sigmoid bowel wall; 14 tumour with rectosigmoid; 15 tumour with rectum; 16&amp;amp;17 peritoneal strip involvement; 18 ? mucosal surface; 19 ? four lymph nodes)

Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue 60x50x40mm. Serial slicing reveals an obliterated vessel and one lymph node 30x30x10mm.

(20&amp;amp;21 lymph node serially sliced). RS (M-21)

D.  &amp;quot;MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;.  Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue 45x35x15mm.  Five lymph nodes are identified 6-30mm. The largest has fatty and peripherally firm cut surface.

(1 one lymph node bisected; 2 one lymph node four TS; 3 one lymph node bisected; 4 one lymph node trisected; 5&amp;amp;6 largest lymph node serially sliced).  RS (M-6)

E.  &amp;quot;RIGHT DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;.  Unorientated glistening piece of tissue 14x10mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 2mm. The possible margin is inked blue. Serially sliced.  AE (M-1/ZH 24/8/2068 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr G Lahrman)
A.  The paraffin sections demonstrate fatty tissue with dense collagenised fibrosis.
B.  The paraffin sections confirm lymph node with metastatic carcinoma.
C.  Sections of the gallbladder are unremarkable.
Sections of the segment of small bowel show submucosal oedema. The mucosa appears unremarkable.  On the serosal surface there are adhesions and numerous serosal deposits of poorly differentiated carcinoma including groups of cells with papillary appearance and with lymphatic space invasion.  Carcinoma on the serosal surface is present at the surgical resection margin.
Sections of the fatty tissue show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with fibroblastic reaction.  Poorly formed irregularly shaped slit-like glandular spaces and papillary architecture is seen in several areas.  There is high nuclear grade and areas of necrosis are seen.
Sections of this segment of colon show normal appearing mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria. The surgical resection margins appear unremarkable.  Within the pericolic adipose tissues there are numerous deposits of poorly differentiated carcinoma with features similar to that described previously.
The sections show reactive changes.
D.  Five lymph nodes are identified and in each of these there is metastatic high grade carcinoma.
E.  The sections shows fibrofatty tissue with overlying mesothelium and with lymphatic permeation by high grade carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry (Block C6): CAM5.2, CK7, PAX-8, p-16, WT-1, and ER are positive. P53 shows strong staining in over 90%. PR shows focal staining only.
Comment : The appearances are those of high grade poorly differentiated carcinoma with morphologic and immunohistochemical features that consistent with high grade serous carcinoma.  Clinical correlation and correlation with the previous pathology results is recommended.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
MLH-1, PMS-2, MSH-2, and MSH-6 all show positive staining present. This is the normal (wild-type) staining pattern. Clinical correlation is recommended.
