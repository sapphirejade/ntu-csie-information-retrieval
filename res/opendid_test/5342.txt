CLINICAL:
Whipple for ?adenoCa.  Atypical cells on EUS cytology.  Mass in uncinate.  Right breast ca +axillary clearance.  ?Hiatus hernia.  Chronic heavy smoker.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Whipple resection" consists of a Whipple's resection comprised of a segment of distal stomach and duodenum 180mm in length and up to 20mm in maximum diameter,pancreas 30 x 40 x 20mm, and a small fragment of omentum (50 x 20 x 10mm. The common bile duct is identified measuring 30mm in length and up to 7mm in maximum diameter.  The common hepatic duct is probe and appears patent.  The external surface of the pancreas is shiny and the consistency is firmer at the uncinate process. The pancreas is inked as follows: portal vein bed margin green, anterior surface  blue, periuncinate soft tissue black and posterior surface red.  The entire pancreas is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 7 slices.Slice 1 most superior, slide 7 most inferior. The cut surface of the pancreas is distorted by a large ill defined solid and tan tumour present in slices 2 to 7. The pancreatic duct is present in slices 1to 3 and appears to disappear fromslice 4.  The ampulla is identified in slice 6.  
Blocks:  1- proximal gastric margin; 2- distal duodenal margin; 3- TS common bile surgical margin; 4 to 7 - serial sections of the common bile duct from proximal to distal; 7 - shave of pancreatic neck; 8  to 14 pancreas AE ( 8- slice 1; 9 - slice 2; 10 - 3; 11 - slice 4; 12 - slice  5 ; 13 - slice 6 ; 14 - slice 7 (LS of uncinate margin)); 15 - bisected posterior pancreatic lymph node; 16 to 21 - omentum AE  (TO:ML  OS/mm 29.12.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Toepke)
Sections show a poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in the head  of the pancreas including uncinate process.  The tumour arranged in cords nests and as single cells with minimal tubal formationand focally extends into the peripancreatic soft tissues in the region of the portal vein bed and anteriorly  There is associated ductal pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (PanIN3) from the carcinoma focally appears to arise.  The carcinoma has the following features.  

SUMMARY PANCREATIC CARCINOMA

Histological tumour type
Ductal adenocarcinoma, NST.
Histological grade 
Grade 3: Poorly differentiated (49% or less of tumour composed of glands) 

Microscopic tumour sites
Pancreas 
Head of pancreas including uncinate process.
Extent of tumour invasion
Pancreas and focally extending into the peripancreatic soft tissues in region of portal vein bed/anterior soft tissue.
Maximum tumour diameter
Approximately 23mm.

Lymphovascular invasion
Two foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion present within pancreas (block 11 and 13)  
	Type of vessel
		Medium sized muscular either lymphatic or small vein.
Perineuralinvasion
Present.  Multiple foci; predominately with the confines of the tumour, focally at its advancing edge including 0.5mm from portal vein bed margin (block 13).  
Perineural invasion of the superior mesenteric artery (uncinate) margin neural plexus
Not identified 
  
Preinvasive lesion
Present.  PanIN3 (eg B11).  
Margins:
Portal vein (superior mesenteric vein): 0.4mm (block 12)
Periuncinate soft tissue (superior mesenteric artery): 0.5mm (block 14)
Pancreatic neck: Clear >5mm.
Common bile duct: Well clear >10mm
Surfaces:
Anterior: 0.8mm (block 11)
Posterior: Well clear
Lymph nodes:
Number found: 17 (10 peripancreatic, 7 omental)
Number involved: 0
Other pathologies: 
- Associated acinar atrophy and fibrosis. 
- Small bowel unremarkable. 
- Distal stomach unremarkable; no Helicobacter seen.
	
Stage (AJCC 7th Ed. 2010)
Primary tumour category (pT) 
T3 Tumour extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery 
Regional lymph node category (pN) 
N0 No regional lymph node metastasis 
Distant metastasis category (pM) 
M0  No regional metastases
COMMENT:
Pathological staging is based on the clinical information provided and examination of the specimens submitted.

DIAGNOSIS:  
Whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy  
- 23mm poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, focal extrapancreatic extension, foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion present, perineural invasion present, 0.4mm from portal vein bed and 0.5mm from periuncinate margin; 17 negative lymph nodes (0/17); stage pT3 N0 M0 (AJCC 7TH Edition).
