DR EUSEBIO Michel Mcnaught
Distribution:  

CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass.  2x LSCS.  ?Borderline tumour.  TAHBSO and staging.
Additional history:  Ca 19.9 in the 1000s.  Previous appendicectomy.  Adherent tumour on surface of right ovary.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tissue right tube/small bowel" consists of three pieces of pale, rather friable, solid tissue 18 x 15 x 3mm in aggregate.  AE in 2 blocks for frozen section.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour borderline tumour, some mucinous differentiation.
Result to Dr Karrak by Dr K Bruender/Dr K Para at 10:40am on 29.09.2065
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of an ovary 90 x 70 x 60mm with possible fallopian tube (no definite fimbrial end), 70 x 6 x 6mm.  There are nodular deposits on the ovarian surface 40 x 35mm.  Slicing reveals solid nodular and cystic cut surfaces.  The cystic component is filled with dark red fluid.
Blocks:  1 - RS including surface deposits for frozen section; 2 - RS for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 - two TS fallopian tube; 4 - one LS one end of fallopian tube, ?fimbrial end; 5 - RS including surface deposits; 6 - RS, reserved block; 7 to 11 - RS.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Borderline mucinous tumour.
Result to Dr Joel by Dr K Mclendon/Dr K Stamnos at 11:15am on 29.09.2065
C.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, left tube and left ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and left ovary weighing 208g in total.  The uterus measures 125 x 70 x 70mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 38 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 35mm in maximum thickness.  There is a polypoid endometrial area 20 x 15 x 8mm.  The myometrium contains one fibroid 20mm in maximum dimension.  The endometrium is up to 4mm in maximum thickness.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 25 x 20mm.  Slicing the ovary reveals a unilocular cyst filled with clear fluid 15mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 to 9 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (4 & 5 - are paired; 6 & 7 - are paired; 8 & 9 - are paired); 10 to 15 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 16 to 18 - ?endometrial polyp; 19 - RS fibroid; 20 - left fallopian tube; 21 to 23 - RSleft ovary.
D.  Specimen labelled "Ileal biopsy" consists of a piece of yellow solid tissue 18 x 10 x 10mm.  BAE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental fatty tissue 270 x 120 x 8mm.  No nodules are seen.  There are few likely lymph nodes 3 to 5mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks:  1 - ?lymph nodes as seen; 2 to 4 - RS.  (TO: LR; WP/rt 30.9.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Mincher):
A.  Sections show borderline mucinous tumour.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
B. Sections of the right ovary show a borderline mucinous tumour.  The lesion is composed of complex cysts and papillae lined by mucinous tumour cells with stratified nuclei showing mild atypia. Serous differentiation is focally present. The epithelium is positive for CK7. CK20 and CDX2 are negative.
No high grade nuclear atypia is seen. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
Surface serosal involvement is present in block B5.
The right fallopian tube appears unremarkable.
C.  Sections of the left ovary and fallopian tube appear unremarkable.
A benign leiomyoma and adenomyosisare present in the myometrium.
The endometrium is in early secretory phase.  There is no evidence of hyperplasia or malignancy.
The cervix shows no evidence of HPV effect or CIN.
D. Sections show fibrous tissue and fat with no evidence of tumour.
E.  Sections show omental fat and 3 lymph nodes with no evidence of tumour.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Tissue right fallopian tube/small bowel: borderline mucinous tumour
B. Right ovary and fallopian tube: borderline mucinous tumour with surface serosal involvement
. Uterus and cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary: adenomyosis and leiomyoma
D. Ileal biopsy: fibrous tissue and fat with no evidence of tumour
E. Omentum: no abnormality detected
