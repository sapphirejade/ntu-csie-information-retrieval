HISTORY:  
GI endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
- Uterus tubes and ovaries
- Omental biopsy
- Right pelvic lymph node
- Left pelvic lymph node.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES". An uterus measures 75x30x25mm. The anterior inked blue, posterior inked black. The endometrium measures 1mm and the myometrium measures 5mm. There is a lesion measures 20x20x25mm in the fundus. The left ovary measures 20x10x5mm (looks unremarkable, the left ovary and tube measures 35x5x5mm). The right ovary measures 20x10x5mm (looks unremarkable). Right ovary and tube measures 50x5x5mm. 
(1&2 left ovary; 3 left fimbria; 4 left fallopian tube; 5 cervix anterior; 6 body anterior; 7 fundus; 8 body posterior; 9 cervix posterior; 10 lesion infundus; 11&12 right ovary; 13 right fimbria; 14 right fallopian tube). RS (M-14)
B. "OMENTUM BIOPSY". A fibrofatty tissue measuring 40x30x5mm. AE (M-3)
C. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". Consists of a piece of irregularfibrofatty tissue, measures 50x50x10mm. 
(1 one lymph node; 2 one lymph node; 3 two lymph nodes; 4&5 rest of the fatty tissue). AE (M-5)
D. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE". An irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 40x30x10mm. AE (M-2/MM/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Q Bahadue)
A.
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA: 
Tumour type:  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma 
FIGO grade:  2
(architecture grade: 2 , nuclear grade: 2 )
Myometrial invasion:  Invasion into outer half of myometrium
Depth of myometrial invasion:  13mm (difficult to assess accurately due to presence of adenomyosis and some polypoid growth of the tumour within the fundus)
Myometrial thickness:  17 mm
Focality:  Unifocal 
Tumour involves:  Fundus
Vascular/lymphatic invasion:  Probable (focal within the myometrium near the deepest point of invasion)
Involvement of cervix:  Not involved
Involvement of uterine serosa:  Not involved (a few fragments of tumour are seen adjacent to the serosal surface, however, this appears to represent focal "carry over" artefact, representing artefactual contamination occurring during specimen handling and processing). 
Excision margins:  Clear
Non-tumour uterus:  
Adjacent endometrium:  An area of probable atypical complex hyperplasia is seen adjacent to the invasive carcinoma. In other areas, the endometrium appears atrophic. 
Polyps:  None identified
Adenomyosis:  Present within the fundus 
Adnexae:  
Left fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality
Right fallopian tube:  No significant abnormality
Left ovary:  Atrophic changes consistent with age 
Right ovary:  Atrophic changes consistent with age
Lymph nodes:  
Nodesinvolved:  See Specimens C&D.

Pathologic Staging (AJCC/UICC TNM 7, FIGO 2008):

TNM stage: pT1b  pN0  pMx
FIGO stage: 1B
B. Sections show lobulated mature adipose tissue only. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
C. The four lymph nodes show reactive changes only. 
D. The two lymph nodes show reactive changes only.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES:
- ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, GRADE 2, STAGE 1B. FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE TEXT.
B. OMENTUM BIOPSY:
- LOBULATED MATURE ADIPOSE TISSUE ONLY.
C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE:
- THE FOUR LYMPH NODES SHOW REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
D. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE:
- THE TWO LYMPH NODES SHOW REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: 

Immunostains for MSIproteins (Phelps Dodge KAROONDA AND DISTRICT SOLDIERS' MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Lab; block:A7)
MLH1: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei
PMS2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei
MSH2: Positive (normal) staining of tumour nuclei
MSH6: Positive (normal) stainingof tumour nuceli
Comment:
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates alow likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storageand fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.
