CLINICAL:
Previous ovarian cancer - ?metastatic disease at laparoscopic port site peri-umbilically and also likely metastatic disease recurrence on sigmoid colon.
Additional history from EMR: previous histology was grade 3 mixed endometrioid and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior abdominal wall" consists of an unorientated elliptical skin excision 220 x 35mm with underlying soft tissue extendingto skeletal muscle 175 x 115 x 50mm.  The resection margin is inked blue.  Slicing reveals a pale solid nodule in the subcutaneous tissue 33 x 30 x 15mm.  The nodule appears clear of margins.  It is 15mm from the epidermal surface.:  1 - tumour and closest margin; 2 - tumour, reserved block; 3 - section of deep margin, macroscopically free of tumour; 4 - section of tumour; 5 - skin overlying the tumour.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental fatty tissue 185 x 145 x 25mm.  Specimen is sliced.  No nodules are seen.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - random sections.
C.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" consists ofa tan solid nodule with attached fatty tissue 32 x 30 x 20mm.  Slicing reveals pale solid cut surfaces.
Blocks:  1 - RS.  (TO: GV; WX/rt 27.8.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Kranwinkle):
A. Sections show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma within fibrous tissue and fat.  The lesion is composed of irregular glands lined by columnar tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei,consistent with endometrioid differentiation.  Solid nests of tumour are also present.  The overlying skin shows no evidence of malignancy.
The lesion is 4 mm from the nearest soft tissue margin.
B. Sections showomental fat with no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma infiltrating fat and muscularis propria.


COMMENT
The current metastases show endometrioid differentiation, and would be consistent with the history of an ovarian primary.
DIAGNOSIS
A and C. Anterior abdominal wall and sigmoid colon nodule: metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with ovarian primary
B. Omentum: no evidence of malignancy
