Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Long standing history of ovarian borderline serous Ca.  Splenectomy for recurrence.  Ovarian Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Spleen&amp;quot;, consists of a spleen weighing 58g and measuring 70 x 60 x 30mm.  Most of the serosa appears intact however numerous linear ruptures are identified on the convex surface as well as on the hilar surface of the splenic capsule.  These vary between 3 and 18mm long.  Within the splenic hilum there is an irregular yellow to pale tan nodule of tumour 25 x 20 x 14mm.  The hilar surface is inked blue.  On sectioning the tumour appears to invade into the splenic parenchyma.   Blocks: 1 - loose fragments of tumour; 2 to 4 - invasion of tumour into splenic parenchyma; 5 - non neoplastic spleen.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a fibrofatty piece of tissue, 130 x 35 x 13mm.  No obvious lesions are identified.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections.  (TO:CJ/eh 15/4/66)
