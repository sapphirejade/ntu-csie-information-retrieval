SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 27/7/65

HISTORY:  
Ovarian cancer on rectal biopsy.  Photographs please.

MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "RIGHT OVARY, RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE".  An ovary with solid and cystic areas weighing 50g total.  The ovary measures up to 60x45x35mm and has a bosselated haemorrhagic surface.  There is an adherent tube measuring up to 60mm in length and 10mm in external diameter.  The intact external surface is inked blue.  The cut surface is formed by pale haemorrhagic tumour.
(1-5 representative tumour; 6 representative tube with fimbrial ends; 7 tumour reserve block).  RS (M-7).
B.  "OMENTUM"  Multiple pieces of omentum measuring in aggregate 80x80x60mm.  There is a pale firm area of tumour measuring 25mm in maximum extent.  
(1&2 deposit transversely sectioned).  RS (M-2).
C.  "UTERUS, CERVIX, RECTOSIGMOID COLON".  A uterus with attached cervix and rectosigmoid colon weighing 360g total.  The uterus measures 50mm from medial to lateral, 70mm from fundus to cervix and up 35mm from anterior to posterior.  The cervix measures 35mm in diameter and appears unremarkable.  The rectosigmoid segment measures 105mm in length and 85mm in diameter and is attached inferior to the pouch of douglas. The posterior and right lateral resection margin of the colon is mostly formed by a mass with a smooth to ragged surface and with some defects formed by visible tumour at this margin (inked red).  On opening, at the posterolateral aspect, there is an ulcerated mass with a full thickness central defect that extends from the right posterolateral ragged connective tissue resection margin (inked red) through to the right lateral aspect of the lumen of the bowel.  The mass measures up to 70x45x65mm.  There is a necrotic appearing lymph node immediately adjacent to the mass measuring up to 55x45x40mm.  On sectioning the uterus, the endometrium and myometrium are unremarkable with no mass lesions identified.
(1-4 posterior cervix to fundus; 5, 6 &7; anterior cervix to fundus; 8 proximal colon resectionmargin; 9 distal colon resection margin; 10-12 full face lumen to red-inked resection margin [intact area]; 13 representative adjacent necrotic node).  RS (M-13/QL/nh)
D. "LEFT OVARY AND TUBE". An irregular mass measuring up to 100x90x75mm with possible attached fallopian tube that is dilated and involved with tumour measuring up to 75mm in length and 20mm in diameter. There is a portion of adherent omentum measuring up to 110x80x5mm. The specimen weighsin total 450g. The external surface is bosselated and cream to yellow with haemorrhagic rough areas. There are scattered attacheded cysts with clear fluid contents. On sectioning the tumour is solid with occasional haemorrhagic areas. 
(1-10 representative tumour, [one each with external surface]; 11&12 possible fallopian tube; 13 tumour reserve block). RS (M-13).
E. "RECTOSIGMOID MESENTERY". An irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring  up to 20x20x5mm with three possible nodes. RS (3-1).
F. "LARGE BOWEL SEROSA". An irregular piece of haemorrhagic tissue measuring up to 25x15x10mm. There is a firmer area ?node measuring 8mm in maximum extent. 
(1 possible node bisected; 2 remaining tissue). AE (M-2).
G. "OMENTAL NODULE". An irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 15x10xup to 3mm. There is a small pale area 2mm in maximum extent ?tumour. AE (1-1).
. "DONUT". Two donuts on instrumentation. The first measuring up to 25mm in diameter and 10mm in length with staple. Staple removed. Margins inked black. Bisected. 
(1&2 donut 1 all embedded).
Donut 2 on instrument measuring up to 20mm in diameter and 8mm long with sutures. Margin inked blue. Sutures removed bisected. 
(3 donut 2 all embedded). AE (2-1/MK/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. Y. Devit)
A. Sections show extensive involvement of the ovary by high-grade serous carcinoma. The carcinoma is characterised by solid, trabecular and gyriform architecture. Areas of slit like fenetrations and pseudoglandular formations are also noted. Tumour nuclei are high-grade with brisk mitotic activity. Immunostains show thatthe tumour is strongly positive for WT1 and p53, and the proliferative index on Ki67 is in the range of 50-60%. Sections of the fallopian tube including the fimbrial end show no evidence of malignancy. There is patchy serosal inflammation with granulation tissue.
B. Sections show involvement of the sampled omentum by a deposit of high-grade serous carcinoma, with features as described in Specimen A. 
C. Sections show a deposit of high-grade serouscarcinoma which involves the full thickness of the bowel wall from an ulcerated mucosal surface to the macroscopically described irregular right posterolateral surgical margin. The carcinoma shows features as described in Specimen A. Thesection of the proximal colonic resection margin is unremarkable. Sections of the distal resection margin show no involvement of the transected wall margin. However, the involved radial margin extends to within 5mm of this margin. 
Sections of the uterus show weakly proliferative endometrium and sections of the cervix are unremarkable. There is no evidence of glandular or squamous atypia or dysplasia. One reactive pericolic lymph node is identified.
D. Sections show extensive involvement of the ovary by high-grade serous carcinoma with appearances as previously described. Focally, uninvolved ovarian parenchyma is present including follicles in varying stages of development. No definite fallopian tube is identified. 
E. Sections show three benign reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of malignancy.
F. Sections show strips and polypoid portions of inflamed granulation tissue, partially invested by peritoneum with features of reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show one benign reactive lymph node. There is no evidence of malignancy.
H. Sections of the donuts show no evidence of malignancy.

D. LEFT OVARY AND TUBE
- INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH-GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA.
F. RECTOSIGMOID MESENTERY
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
G. OMENTAL NODULE
- ONE BENIGN REACTIVE LYMPH NODE.
H. DONUT
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 16/7/65
A. Further immunostains show that the tumour is positive for PAX8, shows weak to moderate staining for ER and is negative for calretinin. The findings are in keeping with the diagnosis of high grade serous carcinoma.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: 
Immunostains for MSI proteins (Cablevision Systems PARKES 7 EAST; block: A5)
MLH1:  	POSITIVE (normal)
PMS2: 	POSITIVE (normal)
MSH2: 	POSITIVE (normal)
MSH6: 	POSITIVE (normal)
Comment:
Mismatch repair gene deficiency NOT DETECTED

Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme. 
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
