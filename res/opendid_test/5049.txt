CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer, caecal cancer.  OT planned on 12/1/65, laparoscopic hysterectomy, BDO, PLND, right hemicolectomy, possible stoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a previously opened and disrupted uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 170g in total.  The uterus measures 105 x 55 x 55mm in its partial opened state.  The serosa is smooth and shiny.  The ectocervix measures 20 x 25mm.  The uterus is distortedby a large fibroid within the anterior myometriummeasuring 50 x 50 x 50mm.  The specimen is receivedopened with an oblique cut  along the posterior wall and a cut into the cervix, anterior endometrium and partially into theunderlying fibroid.  In the right posterolateral wall and close to the cornu is an ulcerated area, 10 x 10mm.  In the posterior fundus close to the previous incision is a slightly raised nodule, 5 x 5mm.   No other obvious endometrial tumour is seen.  At the ulcerated area the tumour appears to invade into the superficial myometrium with a maximum depth of invasion of 4mm where the total myometrial thickness is 19mm.  The tumour appears to extend to the right cornual region (block 9).  Underlying thetumour is a fibroid, 10 x 10mm.  The tumour also appears to extend to the right anterolateral wall where the maximum depth of invasion is 5mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 14mm; tumour is 9mm from the serosa in this region (block 11).  Within the posterior myometrium there are three intramural fibroids ranging from 8mm to 20mm in main diameter.  Within the anterior myometrium there are two fibroids, 10mm and 50mm in diameter.  The right fallopian tube measures 42mm long and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary measures 18x10x5mm.  The right tube and ovary are unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm long and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary measures 35x15x10mm.  The external surface of the left ovary is lobulated and there is a calcified area 15 x 8 x 15mm.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - posterior body and cervix (block 4 contains the slightly raised nodule); 5 to 10 - right posterior wall (block 6 & 7 - composite sections); 11 - right anterior wall closest to the serosa; 12 to 16 - (13 & 14, 15 & 16 are composite sections) anterior body and cervix; 17 - right fimbria end; 18 -right tube; 19 - right ovary; 20 - left fimbrial end; 21 - left tube; 22 - left ovary (the softer part of the section).  (TO:JAN;MASON/ta 12/2/65); 23 - the calcified half of the ovary.

B.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy including the right colon (170mm in length and 75mm in open circumference) and terminal ileum (50mm in length and 30mm in open circumference).  The mesocolon is 80mm in maximum thickness.  Within the caecum is a fungating and ulcerated tumour, 70 x 60mm.  Mild serosal puckering is present which is inked blue.  The tumour is 10mm from the ileocaecal valve and the valve does not appear to be involved.  On sectioning the tumour appears to invade through the caecal wall and abut the serosa at the point of puckering (block 9).  The tumour also appears to abut the mesocolon.  The remaining colonic mucosa has three sessile polyps, 5mm, 3mm and 3mm diameter.  There are two additional small polyps, 2mm each, in the ascending colon. The terminal ileum is unremarkable.  The proximal ileal margin is inked black and distal colonic margin inked green.  There are eighteen lymph nodes identified measuring 2 to 10mm.  
Blocks: 1 - distal colonic margin; 2 - small bowel margin; 3 - ileocaecal valve; 4 - sessile polyp close to the ileocaecal vale (30mm from the tumour) bisected; 5 - sessile polyp in the ascending colon (35mm from the tumour), bisected; 6 - sessile polyp from the ascending colon (45mm from the tumour); 7 - two small polyps; 8 to 10 - composite sections, LS of the tumour showing the serosa puckering in block 9; 11 - tumour with serosal puckering; 12 - tumour abutting the serosal puckering; 13 - tumour and ileocaecal valve; 14 & 15 - composite sections tumour abutting the pericolic fat; 16 - TS of tumour and adjacent normal bowel mucosa; 17 - apical node bisected; 18 - one node bisected; 19 - four nodes; 20 - five nodes; 21 & 22 - three nodes in each block; 23 - one node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of a vermiform appendix measuring 45mm in length 3mm in diameter with attached mesoappendix measuring 13mm.  The serosa is smooth and shiny.  The base of the appendix is inked black.  There is  fibrous obliteration at the tip.  
Blocks: 1 - tip; 2 - TS; 3 - base.  Appendix AE.  (TO:PERRY;FREEMAN/ta 12/2/65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Hodgen): 
A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. There is some squamous differentiation.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  The maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 6mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 10mm.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.  There is no cervical involvement. 
Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  
Sections of the right fallopian tube show a focus of tumour, similar to the endometrial tumour and staining oestrogen receptor positive, attached to the fimbrial end of the tube. The fallopian tube is otherwise unremarkable. This is interpreted as a metastasis.  
Sections of the left fallopian tube are unremarkable. A section of the right ovary shows the presence of a few small simple cysts.  Sections of the left ovary show an area of dense, hyalinised, poorly cellular stroma which is partly calcified; this is possibly an old fibroma.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable.
B.  Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  Just over 50% of the tumour has prominent extracellular mucus so overall it qualifies as a mucinous adenocarcinoma.  A synoptic report follows:

Background abnormalities/other comments
Adenomas - Three of the described polyps are tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status:  
MLH1:		Loss of nuclear staining.
PMS2:		Loss of nuclear staining.
MSH2:            	Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:		Preserved nuclear staining.
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
C.  Sections show an appendixwith fibrous obliteration of the lumen.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  
1.   Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion. Focal metastasis at fimbrial end of right tube. FIGO stage 3A.
2.    Leiomyomas. 
B.   Right hemicolectomy:  
1.  Well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of caecum.  No lymph node metastases (0/24).  pT3  pN0  pMX . 
2.  Three tubular adenomas.
