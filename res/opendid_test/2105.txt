CLINICAL:
Lesser sac lesion ?gastric GIST.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "GIST lesser curvature stomach", consists of a multinodular tan mass, 55 x 40 x 30mm.  On one surface there is a stapled margin 24mm in length (inked black).  The remainder of the specimenis inked blue.  On the opposite surface there is overlying adipose tissue, 80 x 45 x 10mm.  The cut surfaces show a tan fleshy mass with central cystic degeneration and haemorrhage.  The tumour abuts the stapled margin, however appears to have been removed intact.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - tumour with stapled margin (1, reserved block); 4 to 6 - further section of tumour.  (TO: PF;MY/vo 17.6.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Moorehouse/Dr Z Schemonia):
The sections show a spindle cell neoplasm with multinodular architecture.Most of the tumour appears covered by a thin fibrous capsule, however there areareas of tongue-like infiltration into the adjacent adipose tissue.  The tumour cells are arranged in short fascicles, and have elongated bland nuclei with paranuclear vacuoles.  Up to 3 mitoses per 50 HPF are identified.  No necrosis isidentified.  No gastric mucosa or muscularis is identified.  
Immunohistochemical stains:
C-Kit:  Positive.
CD34:  Positive.
Desmin:  Negative.
Smooth muscle actin:  Negative.
S100:  Negative.
These features are of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).  Based on the macroscopic size of 55mm and a mitotic count of 3/50HPF, this tumour is classified as low malignant potential.
The tumour abuts the inked excision opposite the stapled margin.  Thestapled margin is free of involvement.
DIAGNOSIS:
Lesser curvature stomach nodule:  Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) of low malignant potential.
