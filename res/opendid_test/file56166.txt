MARGIN INKED:  Non- Standard: Anterosuperior blue,anteroinferior green, posterior black
DISSECTION: Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION:  Located at 110mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock in the posterior half, there is a firm pale tumour measuring 16x10x15mm. The lesion is 15mm from the posterior margin.  Located 120mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock in the anterior side there is a scarred area 10mm across which lies 35mm medial to the firm lesion in the anterior half.  Located at 80mm from 2 o&amp;apos;clock in the posterior half, there is a hard calcified area measuring 15x5mm.  The closest margin is the posterior margin. The calcification is clear of the margin by 14mm.
(1-4 lesion in the posterior half [1&amp;amp;2 composite, 3&amp;amp;4 composite]; 5-8 cavity [5&amp;amp;6 composite, 7&amp;amp;8 composite]; 9-11 interval between the cavity and the lesion in the anterior half in composite; 12&amp;amp;13  lesion, anterior half; 14 upper outer quadrant; 15-18 hard calcification 30mm to the anterior margin [15&amp;amp;16 include one section composite, 17&amp;amp;18 one section composite]; 19 lower outer quadrant; 20 lower inner quadrant; 21 upper inner quadrant; 22 nipple).

&amp;#160;

ANCILLARY TESTS:
IMMUNOSTAINS, block 1
ER:  POSITIVE   95%   3+
PR:  POSITIVE     5%   2+
HER2: POSITIVE  3+, SISH to follow.

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;
SEPARATE FINDINGS:  There is an area of mature fibrous scarring 35mm medial to the carcinoma which is associated with some plump stromal fibroblasts consistent with a previous surgical bed with radiotherapy effect.  Elsewhere the breast tissue is relatively atrophic with patchy dystrophic stromal microcalcification and some heavily calcified vessels.
