Sarcoma R leg.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Lesion right leg stitch at 12 o'clock" and consists of an oval excision of skin extending to underlying fascia, 98 x 68 x 17mm.  There is a suture along one side indicating 12 o'clock.  The 12 o'clock margin is inked green, 6 o'clock red and deep black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock into seventeen slices.  Centred within the subcutis is a circumscribed multinodular pale grey tumour, 70 x 30 x 20mm.  The 9 o'clock portion of the tumour has a more tan and fleshy appearance.  A focal haemorrhagic area is seen.  The tumour forms an ulcerated nodule in the overlying skin, 34 x 28 x 5mm.  The tumour is 1mm clear of the deep margin, 4mm from the 6 o'clock margin, 5mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 18mm from the 12 o'clock margin, and 18mm clear of the 3 o'clock margin macroscopically.     
Blocks: 1 - LS 3 o'clock margin; 2 & 3 - cross section through tumour; 4 - tumour with closest 12 o'clock margin; 5 - haemorrhagic area of tumour;6 - 9 o'clock portion of tumour with fleshy appearance; 7 - 9 o'clock portion of tumour with close deep margin; 8 & 9 - 9 o'clock area of tumour with closest 6 o'clock margin; 10 - 9 o'clock edge of tumour; 11- 9 o'clock margin embedded as TS.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Oliger): 
Sections show skin and subcutis with deeper fascia.  There is a malignant tumour in the subcutis and extending into deeper fascia, and also involving dermis and partially ulcerating the epidermis.  Much of the tumour is lobulated and quite well circumscribed but part of it is more infiltrative.  It is moderately cellular and consists mainly of highly atypical cells which are mononuclear or multinucleate.  The nuclei are large and irregular, often with a single prominent nucleolus, and there is a variable amount of eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm.  Many multinucleate tumour giant cells are present.  The tumour also has a component of atypical spindle cells.  There is moderate treatment effect with remaining viable tumour being only moderately cellular and showing prominent dense fibrosis between and amongst residual tumour cells, and also some patchy chronic inflammation.  Mitoses are infrequent.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.
Immunostains 
Pancytokeratin: Negative.
Smooth muscle actin:  Negative.
S100:  Negative.
Desmin:  Negative.
Ki-67: Moderate proliferation index, around 25%.  
The tumour extensively infiltrates and replaces fat.  Atypical cells are seen amongstfat but these are interpreted as infiltrating tumour cells rather than a co-existing component of low grade fatty tumour.  
The features are most consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells, showing treatment effect.
The tumour extends to the deep excision margin at the 9 o'clock end of the specimen (block 17) and also focally extends to the 6 o'clock margin (blocks 8, 10).  It is 5mm from the 9 o'clock margin and 15mm from the 12 o'clock margin.  The 3 o'clock margin is well clear.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Right leg:  Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells, showing moderate treatment effect.  See text.
