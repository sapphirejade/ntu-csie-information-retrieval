CLINICAL:
Endometrioid adenoCa with cervical involvement.  Increased Ca125 >100 - rad hyst BSO + PLND.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 147g in total.  The uterus has a full thickness longitudinal defect over 80mm long x 50mm wide.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 50mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and there is a noduleof haemorrhagic tumour on the posterior surface measuring 20 x 15 x 10mm.  On sectioning there is an ulcerated exophytic tumour involving the anterior and posterior uterus.  Anteriorly the tumour measures 50 x 35mm and is 25mm from the cervical os.  Posteriorly the tumour measures 60 x 50mm and is 23mm from the cervical os.  The tumour involves both cornua.  The tumour appears to invade to the outer half of the uterine wall posteriorly.  The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length x 6 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkablecut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length x 8 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 20 x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior bodyand cervix; 5 & 6 - representative of endometrial tumour anteriorly; 7 to 11 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 12 & 14 - further sections of deepest invasion posteriorly; 15 - further section of nodule at posterior cervix; 16 - right fallopian tube; 17 - right ovary; 18 - left fallopian tube; 19 - left ovary; 20 - tumour for tumour banking.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 180 x 70 x 10mm.  No mass lesions are identified within the fibrofatty tissue.  Representative in 3 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 70 x 70 x 15mm.  Possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3 to 25mm in maximum dimension.  :  1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 to 4 - lymph nodes as seen.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic nodes" consists of multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 45 x 40 x 15mm.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 to 28mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes AE.
Blocks:  1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2 & 3 - lymph nodes as seen.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 and 40mm in length.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 to 50mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node bisected; 2- lymph nodes as seen.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left paraaortic lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 32 x 15 x 8mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 5 and 25mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 2- lymph nodes as seen.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left lower paraaortic lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 10 x 6mm.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3 to 5mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2- rest of specimen.  AE. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Umbilical hernia" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 35 x 30 x 10mm.  One surface is peritonealised and the opposite is ragged fibroadipose tissue.  The deeper aspect is inked black.  No focal lesion is seen on sectioning.  Representative in 3 blocks.  (TO: QQ:  MY/mm 17.8.65) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr L Lecznar/Dr L Sindt):
A.  The sections show a mixed endometrial carcinoma composed predominantly of clear cell carcinoma (70%) admixed with endometrioid carcinoma (30%).  The endometrioid component is grade 2.  Some of the clear cell carcinoma comprises cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour invades into the outer half of the myometrium, invading to a depth of 14mm through a total myometrial thickness of 17mm.  No serosal involvement is seen.  There are foci of lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium and in the cervix.
A separate deposit of mixed endometrioid and clear cell adenocarcinoma is confirmed involving the posterior cervix, with stromal invasion; depth of cervical stromal invasion is 5mm out of a total cervical stromal thickness of 14mm.  Carcinoma is 9mm from the vaginal cuff margin at the closest point.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is identified.
A small lymphangiomyoma, 3mm diameter, is also noted in the outer myometrium (block A4).  
The fallopian tubes and ovaries are uninvolved by tumour, and show nosignificant abnormality.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Loss of nuclear staining
MSH6		Loss of nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 orMSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
B.  The sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The sections show thirteen negative lymph nodes (0/13).  Atleast five of the nodes show partial involvement by lymphangiomyomatosis.  
D.  The sections show six negative lymph nodes (0/6).  Two lymph nodes show a subcapsular proliferation of monomorphic spindle cells associated withsmall vascular spaces.  The spindle cells show positive staining with HMB45, SMA and desmin.  These features are consistent with lymphangiomyomatosis.  
E.  The sections show four negative lymph nodes (0/4).  Three of the nodes are partially involved by lymphangiomyomatosis.
F.  The sections show two negative lymph nodes (0/2).  One node is partially involved by lymphangiomyomatosis. 
G.  The sections show one negative lymph node (0/1).The node is partially involved by lymphangiomyomatosis. 
H.  The sections show mesothelium with underlying dense fibrous tissue and fat more deeply.  There is no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Comment:  Several lymph nodes show involvement by lymphangiomyomatosis, and a small lymphangiomyoma is also present in the outer myometrium.  Lymphangiomyomatosis can also involve the lungs and is associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.
 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:  .  Mixed clear cell and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion and cervical stromal invasion.  Stage 2.
2.  Small lymphangiomyoma in outer myometrium, see comment.
B to H.  Multiple lymph nodes (bilateral pelvic, right common iliac, left paraaortic, left lower paraaortic), umbilical hernia, omentum:
-  No evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/26 lymph nodes).
-  Lymphangiomyomatosis partially involving twelve lymph nodes, see comment.
