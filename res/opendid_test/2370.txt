CLINICAL:
BRCA positive.  Laparoscopic hysterectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus,cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uteruswith attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovary weighing 147.5g  The uterus measures 90 x 25 x 35mm and has smooth shiny surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 32mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium shows multiple small fibroids measuring from 3 to 20mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with an outer diameter of 8mm.  The right ovary measures 40mm x 30mm x 10mm.  The cut surface of right fallopian tube shows tan brown surface with a focal area of haemorrhage measuring 20 x 10 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length with an outer diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 40 x 25 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the left ovary a few small unilocular cysts filled with clear fluid measuring from 4 to 10mm. 
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 6 to 9 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 10 and 11 - RS of fibroids; 12 to14 -AE right fallopian tube; 15 to 21 -AE right ovary; 22 to 24 - AE left fallopian tube; 25 to 29 -left ovary AE.   (TO: VW;RL/vo 4.7.65) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Q Horrigan)
The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality. The endometrium is secretory. The myometrium shows leiomyomas. The bilateral fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. The ovaries show follicles at varying stages ofdevelopment, as well as, focal endometriosis and endosalpingiosis. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus and bilateral fallopian tubes/ovaries:
Secretory endometrium. 
Leiomyomas.
Ovarian endometriosis/endosalpingiosis. 
No evidence of malignancy.
