CLINICAL NOTES:
R subdiagphragmatic nodule frozen section, right colon ca, post resection + liver resection 2066, now came with local recurrence + liver + peritoneum.  Previous right hemicolectomy anastomosis, omentum and peritoneum.  Right liver and segment 1.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT SUBDIAPHRAGMATIC NODULE&amp;quot;.  20mm pieces of tissue with 10mm hard nodule.  One TS taken for frozen section and imprints were done.

F/S:  &amp;quot;Fibrosis and inflammation&amp;quot;.  Results were given by Dr. O. Deman on 25.4.2066.

(1  frozen; 2&amp;amp;3  remainder tissue serially sliced).  AE (M-3).

B.  &amp;quot;OMENTUM, RIGHT HEMICOLON, PERITONEUM&amp;quot;.  Received in the same specimen jar, multiple tissue fragments including,

A segment of bowel with a line of anastomosis between small bowel 85mm and large bowel 120mm they are up to 35 and 55 mm in circumference respectively.  Attached is mesentery and mesocolon up to 45mm.  Multiple adhesions are identified on the outer surface with multiple areas of haemorrhagic on the mesenteric serosa.  No definite nodules are identified.  The mucosal surfaces have no polyps or tumours.  Serial slicing of mesentery reveals possible calcified vessels.

(1  proximal margin; 2  distal margin; 3  anastomosis; 4&amp;amp;5  calcified vessel small bowel mesentery; 6  large bowel adhesion; 7  ?five lymph nodes).

A segment of small bowel 70x30mm with mesentery up to 25mm.  The outer surface has focal areas of haemorrhage at the mesentery.  No tumour deposits are identified.  The mucosal surfaces are unremarkable.  The cut surface of the mesentery is haemorrhagic.

(8  LS of each resection margin; 9  TS mid with haemorrhagic mesentery).

Multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue consistent with omentum with attached peritoneum measuring 240x170x40mm.  Multiple areas of haemorrhage are identified across the specimen.  Serial slicing reveals at least two tumour deposits, largest measures 40x20x10mm with hard white cut surface.  The smaller measures 10mm in maximum diameter.

(10-12  omental largest nodule with block 12 tumour block for tissue banking; 13  smaller peritoneal nodule; 14  adhesions).  RS (M-14/ZH 30/5/2066 km)

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT LIVER, RIGHT LOBE, SEGMENT 1 AND 2&amp;quot;. Deep within the same jar three segments of liver.

The largest segment is a right hepatectomy specimen190x130x60mm, weighing 652g. The capsular surface is slit opened by the surgeon at two separate locations. There is a gallbladder in-situ, measuring 75x30mm, with smooth outer surface. The surgical resection margin is inked blue. Serially slicing reveal two lesions:

Lesion number one is located laterally, closely related to the gallbladder (Segment V), measuring 42x37x25mm, located 7mm of the nearest resection margin and 8mm of the nearest capsule.

The second lesion, 27x24x20mm,  is located medially towards (segment IV) and has an adjacent haemorrhagic cavity 40x40x35mm with golden brown inner lining.It is located within 17mm of the nearest resection margin and within 5mm of the adjacent cavity. The cut surface of the gallbladder reveals a 3mm wall with unremarkable mucosal surface. The cut surface of the adjacent liver is micronodular and grossly cirrhotic.

(1 cystic duct and TS neck; 2 TS body with adjacent liver; 3 LS fundus with adjacent liver; 4&amp;amp;5 continuous slice, full face of Lesion No. 1; 6 further Lesion No. 1 with resection margin; 7-10 Lesion No. 2 with 8&amp;amp;9 containing lesion and cavity; 10 nearest resection margin; 11 uninvolved liver).

A second wedge resection of liver, 46g, consists of a capsule 80x5mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 40mm. The margin is inked blue, serially slicing revealing a hard white lesion, 37x20x17mm, within 2mm of the nearest resection margin and involving the overlying capsule macroscopically.

(12&amp;amp;13 full face of lesion with a nearest resection margin; 14 LS of each peripheral resection margin [uninvolved liver]).

A wedge resection of liver, 8g, consists of a capsule 20x20mm, with between tissue to a depth of 8mm. The margin is inked blue. The cut surface reveals a hard, white lesion, 15x15mm, located 4mm of the nearest resection margin and involving the overlying capsule macroscopically.

(15 TS mid and two LS of each peripheral margins). RS (M-15/ZH 23/4/2066 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. O. Veverka)
A. Sections show fibrous tissue with chronic inflammation and foreign body granulomatous reaction in keeping with previous surgery. There is no evidence of malignancy.

B. Sections through the right hemicolectomy specimen show anastomosed small to large bowel with surface fibrous adhesions and no evidence of tumour. Two local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes.

Sections through the separately submitted segment of small bowel show focal interstitial haemorrhage in the mesentery and otherwise no significant abnormality. No tumour is seen.

Sections through omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments show metastatic deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary.

C. Sections through the three separate wedge resections of liver show metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive areas of necrosis in keeping with origin from colorectal primary. The larger resection has an unremarkable attached gallbladder and shows two metastatic deposits, the two other wedge resections of liver show a single metastasis each.

The liver parenchyma away from tumour shows mild fatty change, and otherwise no significant abnormality.

Local resection of the tumour deposits appears complete.

SUMMARY:
RIGHT SUBDIAPHRAGMATIC NODULE:

RIGHT LIVER, RIGHT LOBE, SEGMENT 1 AND 2:
- METASTATIC DEPOSITS OF COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA.
