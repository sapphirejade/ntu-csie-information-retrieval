MUSCLE:  No
MARGIN INKED: Non-standard: Anterosuperior - blue; Anteroinferior - green; Posterior - black.
DISSECTION:
Specimen bi-valved in the coronal plane with a medial hinge followed by multiple parasagittal slices of anterior and posterior halves.
FINDINGS / LESION: About 10 o&amp;apos;clock, there is an area of granulation tissue, fat necrosis and fibrosis consistent with the cavity measuring approximately 70x50x40mm. It is about 5nn from deep margin.
(1 nipple; 2-17 sections of cavity [please refer to diagram]; 18 upper outer quadrant; 19 lower outer quadrant; 20 lower inner quadrant; 21 upper inner quadrant). RS (M-21)
B. &amp;quot;RE-EXCISION RIGHT INFERIOR FLAP&amp;quot;. Irregular fibrofatty tissue fragments, 10g, and 50x30x20mm. Outer surface is inked blue, serially sliced. Sectioning does not show any tumour or lesion. Representative sections embedded in Blocks 1-4. RS (M-4/SM 25/5/2071 cy)
MICROSCOPIC: (Dr T Skog)
A.  Histology shows the previous biopsy cavity to be formed by maturing fibrous scar tissue and fat necrosis.  This is mostly benign breast with occasional focus of usual-type hyperplasia and a small intraduct papilloma.  Adjacent to the cavity there is a 4mm focus of intermediate grade DCIS which is well clear of margins.  The nipple is unremarkable.  No invasive carcinoma is identified.

B.  Histology shows further benign fibrofatty breast tissue with no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  RIGHT MASTECTOMY - SMALL FOCUS OF DCIS, MARGINS CLEAR.
B.  RE-EXCISION RIGHT INFERIOR FLAP - BENIGN FIBROFATTY BREAST TISSUE.
