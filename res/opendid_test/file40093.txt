HER-2 IN-SITU HYBRIDISATION

Signal Detection has been performed for the HER2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche).

HER2 Dual ISH result:          NEGATIVE

Mean HER2 copy number per cell:   3.3
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 2.3
HER2/CEP17 Ratio: 1.43

SCORING CRITERIA (Updated in line with ASCO/CAP recommendations 2013):
Negative: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;lt; 4.0
Equivocal: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt; 2.0, Average HER2 &amp;gt; 4.0 and &amp;lt; 6.0
Positive: HER2/CEP17 &amp;lt;2.0, Average HER2 &amp;gt; 6.0
Positive: HER2/CEP17 &amp;gt; 2.0
