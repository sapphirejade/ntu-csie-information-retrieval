CLINICAL NOTES:   Peritoneal washings for cytol. Uterus, tubes, ovaries. Right pelvic sentinel node.Left pelvic sentinel node. Omental biopsy. G1 endometrioid adenoca.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES&amp;quot;. Consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and bilateral ovaries received partially opened on the coronal plane through the cervix and lower uterus. Total weight 214g. Uterus and cervix measures 95mm superior to inferior, anterior to posterior cervix 32mm, right to left cervix 40mm. Uterus measures anterior to posterior 75mm and intercornual distance of 68mm. Presumed anterior cervix inked blue and posterior inked black. Multiple 10 to 30mm diameter nodular protrusions on the uterus serosal apex and posterior surfaces. Three smaller nodules are attached loosely by serosa. Sectioning reveals anterior uterus is 50mm, posterior uterus 20mm, endometrial cavity is 1mm. A 12x10x7mm papillary lesion protrudes into the endometrial cavity from the far left apex. It is 7mm from the left cornu and macroscopically invades into the myometrium for abour 5mm with a distance of 7mm to the serosal surface.
Lesion is slices from superior to inferior into 5 slices. Multiple 4 to 35mm diameter well circumscribed creamy whorled lesions seen in the anterior and posterior uterus, corresponding to nodular protrusions on the serosa.

The right fallopian tube is 58x7mm has a 17mm diameter clear fluid filled cyst attached at the distal end. It has an unremarkable cut surface. The right ovary is 40x15x12mm and an unremarkable superficial and cut surface. Left fallopian tube is 55x6mm. Serosa is tan brown with a 15mm diameter cyst filled with dark brown ?haemorrhagic material. Cut surface unremarkable. Left ovary is 20x14x10mm. The serosa and cut surfaces are unremarkable.

(1,2 right, left parametrium; 3 right fallopian tube; 4 right ovary; 5 left fallopian tube; 6 left ovary; 7 left parametrium near the papillary lesion; 8-15 full face of midline uterus and cervix [8 anterior cervix, 9 posterior cervix]; 16,17 lesion slice 1; 18,19 lesion slice 2; 20 lesion slice 3; 21,22 lesion slice 4; 23 lesion slice 5). Representative sections. (M-23)

B. &amp;quot;RIGHT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. A 25x15x10mm piece of fatty tissue with a 20x5x4mm lymph node contained. Cut surface unremarkable. All embedded. (M-2)

C. &amp;quot;LEFT PELVIC SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fatty tissue 25x7x8mm. It contains two possible lymph nodes 15x6x4mm, and 9x4x3mm. Cut surface is unremarkable.
(1 larger lymph node; 2 smaller lymph node). All embedded. (M-2)

D. &amp;quot;OMENTAL BIOPSY&amp;quot;. A 18x18x6mm piece of fatty tissue with firm area 9x2x2mm.
Trisected. All embedded. (M-1/ 20/2/2071 ank)
