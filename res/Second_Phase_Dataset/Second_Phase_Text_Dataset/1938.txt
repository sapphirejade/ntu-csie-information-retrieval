CLINICAL:
Known CLL. Sudden increase R cervical node, ? transformation. 
Further history from Dr T Allor - patient also has mediastinal lymphadenopathy. ?CLL, ?lung carcinoma. Please also perform keratin stains to exclude metastatic carcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right supraclavicular lesion", consists of five pieces of core biopsy 5-15mm. AE 1 block.  (TO: RZ/ec   10.1.64)  
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof T Times):
The sections show a diffuse population of small, monotonous lymphoid cells with round nuclei, clumped chromatin and indistinct nucleoli.
No significant component of large lymphoid cells is seen and mitoses are not readily identified.
Fixation appears poor, making interpretation of immunoperoxidase staining difficult.
The lymphoid cells show positive staining with CD20 and probable light chain restriction with lambda. Ki67 expression is low. There is also weak staining with CD5 in a background of admixed CD5 and CD3 positive T cells.
CD23 is also positive within an area of better fixed lymphoid tissue at the end of one core.
This case was discussed with Dr T Vickerman who also also requested cytokeratin staining.
Stains for AE1/AE3 and Cam 5.2 are negative and there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in these cores.
The overall appearances areconsistent with the clinical history of CLL and there is no diagnostic evidence of large cell transformation or metastatic carcinoma.
Dr T Swinger has also seen representative sections and concurs.
DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT SUPRACLAVICULAR CORE BIOPSY: CONSISTENT WITH CLL
