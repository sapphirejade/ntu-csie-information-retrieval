CLINICAL:
Lichen sclerosus.  Posterior skinning vulvectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Post skinning vulvectomy" consists of an irregular piece of hair bearing skin measuring70 x 31 x 6mm.  No definite lesion is identified on the skin surface.  The deep margin is inked blue.  
Blocks:  1 to 19 - transverse sections of the skin from one end to the other.  
AE.  (TO: HU  GS/mm 22.10.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Turns): 
Sections show mainly skin and subcutis, also with some underlying skeletal muscle.  There is also some squamous mucosa at one end of the specimen.  There is a scar extending through the dermis and into subcutis, consistent with previous surgery.  There are extensive changes of lichens sclerosus and these changes extend to all excision margins.  The whole specimen has been blocked and no dysplasia is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  Much of the epidermis and squamous mucosa shows hyperkeratosis and there is also some mild, patchy squamous hyperplasia. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Posterior vulva skin:  Lichens sclerosus.
