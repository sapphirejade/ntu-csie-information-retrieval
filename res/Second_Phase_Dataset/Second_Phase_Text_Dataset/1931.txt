HISTORY:  
Small bowel cancer.  Underwentperitonectomy.  Small bowel, right colon, liver lesion.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A.  "OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, ABDOMINAL WALL, PERITONEAL DISEASE, RIGHT COLON, GALLBLADDER".
Bowel segment (? Small bowel) - A loop of measuring up to 170mm in length and 30mm in maximal diameter. The loops are adherent with a portion of skeletal muscle attached.  The serosal surface shows some rough areas ? tumour deposit, ? adhesions.  At the area of adhesion there is an ulcerated ? tumour which is located 25mmfrom the black inked resection margin and at least 50mm from the green inked resection margin.  The ? tumour measures approximately 25x20mm.  The tumour has a maximal thickness of 12mm and extends to the mesenteric fat.  It appears clear of the serosal surface but abuts the skeletal muscle. The mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  
(1&2 LS resection margins; 3 tumour with skeletal muscle; 4&5 paired tumour with extension to mesenteric fat; 6 further tumour withskeletal muscle; 7 inherent bowel with mesenteric fat; 8 tumour reserve block; 9 representative mucosa; 10 representative serosal ? adhesions; 11 five possible nodes; 12 six possible nodes; 13 two possible nodes)
Right hemicolectomy - A right hemicolectomy measuring 300mm in length including 50m of terminal ileum. There is no appendix present.  The open circumference at the terminal ileum 45mm and the open circumference at the distal resection margin is 70mm.The external surface shows multiple ? adhesions and there is attached peritoneum at the caecal area measuring up to 90x90mm.  On opening located 190mm from the proximal resection margin and 120mm from the distal resection margin thereis a mural nodule measuring 20mm in maximal extent with overlying serosal puckering.  The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.  No apical node identified.  
(14 LS resection margins; 15&16 mural nodule; 17 representative ascending colon mucosa; 18&19 adherent peritoneal nodule ? tumour; 20 five possible nodes; 21 five possible nodes; 22 three possible nodes; 23 one bisected node). 
Gallbladder - A gallbladder measuring 75mm in length and 35mm in maximal diameter. The serosal surface has a ? adhesions ? tumour deposit.  No cystic duct lymph node identified.  On opening there is viscous bile and no gallstones identified.  
(24 TS resection margin; 25 two TS body including adhesion; 26 two LS fundus)
Omentum - A portion of omentum measuring up to 260x130x20mm.  There are multiple firmer haemorrhagic areas but no definite tumour deposit is identified.
(27-30 representative omentum with firmerareas)
Peritoneal tissue - There are multiple pieces of peritoneal skeletal muscle and fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 60x60x20mm.  
(31&32 RS with ? tumour).  RS (M-32)
B.  "LIVER RESECTION SEGMENT 6".  Portion of liver weighing 6g and measuring up to 30x20x25mm with one capsular surface.  Margins inked green.  On the capsular surface essentially there is an irregular area ? tumour.  Specimen serially sectioned.  
(1-3representative TS).  RS (M-3/VU/ank)
Further tissue:
(B4-B8 further tissue).  AE (M-5/PM/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (W. Woolford)
A.  Sections show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation including extracellular mucin lakes and signet ring differentiation.  The carcinoma is seen to involve the mesentery and wall including mucosa of the small bowel segment with extension into attached portion of skeletal muscle, the caecum with involvement of caecal mesentery, wall and submucosa with intact mucosa and separately submitted peritoneal fragments.  
None out of eleven lymph nodes from the small bowel resection show metastatic tumour. Small bowel surgical margins of resection are clear of tumour.  
One out of thirteen lymph nodes from the right hemicolectomy specimen show metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The surgical margins ofresection of the right hemicolectomy specimen are clear of tumour.  
Sections through the gallbladder show no significant abnormality.  
The omentum is also unremarkable including one reactive lymph node. 
B.  Sections show liver tissue with mild perivenular fatty change and otherwise no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
OMENTUM, SMALL BOWEL, ABDOMINAL WALL, PERITONEAL DISEASE, RIGHT COLON AND GALLBLADDER :

GALLBLADDER AND OMENTUM:
-NO TUMOUR SEEN.
LIVER RESECTION SEGMENT 6 :
-FATTY CHANGE.  NO TUMOUR SEEN.
