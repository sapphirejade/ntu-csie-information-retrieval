CLINICAL:
Hysterectomy and BSO.  Asthma attach, hypoxia ++.  Widespread wheezes but no focal signs on chest.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 152g in total.  Theuterus measures 80 x 65 x 50mm and has a shiny smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix is 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 5mm and the myometrium is 10mm thick.  The endometrial canal in thefundus is ragged and a possible polyp is identified measuring 25 x 20mm.  The right tube measures 55mm in length and 10mm in diameter, the right ovary is 32 x 20 x 20mm.  The cut surfaces of the ovary are unremarkable.  The left fallopiantube measures 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the left ovary is 30 x 20 x 20mm.  The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 9 - representative section of polypoid lesion on the anterior side; 10 to 14 - full LS of posterior body and cervix;15 - representative section of severe thickened endometrium in the body (posterior portion); 16 - right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 17 to 19 - right ovary; 20 - representative section of left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 21 to 23 - left ovary.  
(FV/mm 2.11.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Rinaldis & registrar Dr K ARMANDO Havens):
Sections of the uterus show grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  Tumour invades to depth of 8mm out of a wall thickness of 20mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  An endometrial polyp is also involved by tumour.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  Both ovaries and fallopian tubes also show no significant abnormality. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries:
- Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium
- Invasion to a depth of 8mm out of a wall thickness of 20mm
- No lymphovascular or perineural invasion identified
- Cervix uninvolved
