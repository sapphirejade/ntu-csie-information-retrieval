CLINICAL:
Lung cancer.  Posterior segment (L) upper lobe.  Post mediastinal, hilar, AP window nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left upper lobe lung wedge resection" consists of a wedge of lung weighing 45g pre-inflation and measuring 100 x 40 x 30mm.  There is a stapled margin measuring 120mm in length.  The staple margin is removed and the underlying lung inked blue. (Approximately 3 to 5mm of lung tissue removed with the staples.) The pleural surface is smooth aside from an area over 20 x 18mm which is firm white and puckered.  On sectioning there is a firm well circumscribed tan tumour measuring 25 x 12 x 20mm beneath the puckered area abutting the pleural surface.  The tumour is 1mm from the closest stapled margin.  The lung away from the tumour appears unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6 - paired blocks tumour with closest pleural and stapled margin; 7 - normal lung away from tumour; 8 - biobank tumour section.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Posterior mediastinal lymph node" consists of two pieces of grey/tan tissue containing five possible lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 12mm in maximum dimension.  Specimen AE.
Blocks:  1- lymph nodes as seen; 2- one lymph node bisected; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Hilar lymph node" consists of five possible lymph nodes measuring from 3 to 10mm in maximum dimension.  Specimen AE.  
Blocks:  1- lymph nodes as seen; 2- largest lymph node.  
D.  Specimen labelled "AP window lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes measuring 32 and 30mm in maximum dimension.  Specimen AE.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node serially sectioned; 2- one lymph node serially sectioned.
