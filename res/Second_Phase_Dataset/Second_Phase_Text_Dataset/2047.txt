CLINICAL:
Multifocal ILC left breast with close inferior and medial margins.
1.  Re-excision of margins sent as separate specimen with marking suture on cavity.
2.  ALND.
Sent as level 1/2 and level 2.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Breast bx medial margin/stitch on cavity" consists of a piece of disc like fibrofatty breast tissue 45 x 40mm and 15mm in thickness.  A suture marks the cavity surface is inked blue and the new resection margin is inked black.  No mass or lesion is identified.  AE 8 blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Breast bx inferior margin stitch on cavity" consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty breast tissue 45 x 33 x 25mm.  The sutured cavity surface is inked blue.  The newresection margin is inked black.  Areas of fat necrosis are noted.  No mass or lesion is identified.  AE 9 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Level 1 to axilla" consists of a piece of unorientated fibrofatty tissue 120 x 80 x 30mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  The largest measures 35mm across.
Blocks:  1 to 2 - the largest node, multiple pieces; 3 to 4 - one node, multiple pieces; 5 - one node, three pieces; 6 - five nodes; 7 node bisected; 8 - five nodes; 9 to 10 - six nodes in each block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Level 2 axillary node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 45 x 30 x 10mm.  Small lymph nodes identified.  The largest lymph node measures 20mm across.
Blocks:  1 - three nodes; 2 - one node bisected.  (HN/rt 18.3.65)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Lantigua):
A.  Sections show an occasional lobule with features of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) together with granulation tissue and fat necrosis consistent with the recent surgery.  No invasive malignancy is identified.

B.  Sections show a 5mm focus of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) situated at one end of the specimen, together with granulation tissue and fat necrosis consistent with the recent surgery.  No invasive malignancy is seen.
C.  The twenty six (26) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  The four (4) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left breast medial margin:  LCIS
B.  Left breast inferior margin:  LCIS.
