Distribution:    NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Unknown primary.  Large level 1B/2A node.  Left neck dissection level 1B, level 2 tumour.  Left tonsil, right tonsil, left base of tongue bx, left piriform fossa, right piriform fossa, level 4 node left neck.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tissue neck dissection" consists of two fragments of tissue.  The smaller fragment is 60 x 35 x 25mm andappears to consist of salivary gland.  The larger fragment is 85 x 70 x 35mm and appears to consist of skeletal muscle with adjacent soft tissue.  The salivary gland appears unremarkable.  Within the larger fragment is a nodule 35 x 30 x25mm.  The nodule has a haemorrhagic central cavity.  
Blocks:  1- salivary gland; 2 to 5 - tumour nodule (4 reserve block); 6 - one lymph node; 7 - multiple lymph nodes; (TO: DP:  CG/mm 12.4.65) 8 to 11 - remainder of fat embedded.   (TO: VV;QG/vo 13.4.65) 
 
B.  Specimen labelled "Level 4 node" consists of a tan nodule 15 x 8 x 3mm.  Bisected AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tonsil" consists of a tonsil 35 x 15 x 10mm, weighing 2g.  No focal lesions seen.  AE 2 blocks.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left tonsil" consists ofa tonsil 35 x 14 x 10mm, weighing 2g. No focal lesions seen.  AE 2 blocks.  
E.  Specimen labelled "(R) Piriform fossa" consists of a biopsy 3mm across.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "(L) Piriform fossa" consists of a biopsy 3mm across.  AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "(R) Base of tongue" consists of two biopsies 1 and 2mm across.  AE 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "(L) Base of tongue" consists of four biopsies 2 -4mm across.  AE 1 block.  (TO: CS:  YG/mm 12.4.65)

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Gutenberg):
A. All adipose tissue in the specimen has been embedded.
Sectionsshow a 35mm deposit of metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in level 2. Invasion into skeletal muscle and fat is present.  No residual lymph node tissue is presentin the nodule.
The tumour cells are negative for p16.
Tumour is present at a surgical margin over a 5 mm front (A3).
The submandibular gland and 4 other lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections show 1 lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.
C and D. Sections of the tonsils show no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
E and F. Sections show squamous epithelium with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
G. Sections show squamous epithelium and tonsillar tissue with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
H. Sections at multiple levels show squamous epithelium and tonsillar tissue.  In one of the fragments there is carcinoma in situ, with full thickness involvement of the epithelium by tumour cells with severe nuclear atypia.  No invasive malignancy is identified.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Left neck dissection: 
- 35mm nodule of metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in level 2, invading skeletal muscle and fat, positive margin
- p16 negative
- 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
B. Level 4 lymph node: no evidence of malignancy
C to G. Biopsies right and left tonsils, right and left piriform fossa, right base of tongue: no evidence of malignancy
H. Biopsy left base oftongue: carcinoma in situ, no invasive malignancy seen
