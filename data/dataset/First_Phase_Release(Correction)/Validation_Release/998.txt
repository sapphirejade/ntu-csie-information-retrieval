CLINICAL:
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, involving the cervix. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing in total 120g.  The uterus measures 90 x 40 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface with a  subserousfibroid 11mm in maximum diameter. The ectocervix measures 30 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrial cavity is totally filled with a exophytic and friable tumour extending to the endocervix. The tumour is located 30mm from the vaginal surgical margin. The tumour invades through the myometrium and in some areas abuts the serosal surface. The tumour has a maximum thickness of 14mm. The myometrium is almost totally replaced by tumour.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 5mm in diameter. The fimbria are identified and are unremarkable. The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 10mm and is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 20 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria are not identified. The left ovary has a cystic appearance and measures60 x 40 x 40mm. The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning the cyst contains creamy haemorrhagic material. The internal surface of the cyst is fibrotic.  Representative sections as follows: Blocks 1-4 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 - representative section of endomyometrium with tumour and fibroid; 6 - representative section of anterior cervix with vaginal margin; 7-10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 - representative section of posteriorcervix with vaginal margin; 12 - right parametrial tissue; 13 - left parametrial tissue; 14 - 2LS of right fimbria and 2TS of right fallopian tube; 15 - 1LS of right ovary; 16- 1TS of left fallopian tube with cyst; 17 & 18 - representative sections of left ovarian cyst. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of omentum 105 x 50 x 3mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  3 representative sections in 3 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 40 x 10 x 10mm containing four lymph nodes ranging from 5-20mm. Block 1- one bisected lymph node; 2 -three lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue 30 x 15 x 15mm containing five lymph nodes ranging from 5-15mm.  Block 1- three lymph nodes; 2 - rest of tissue plus two lymph nodes. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 20 x 30 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes 7 and 10mm.  Block 1- two lymph nodes; 2 - rest of tissue.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of three pieces of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 50 x 40 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 5-20mm.  Block 1- two lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node and rest of fatty tissue.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of a lymph node 30 x 10 x 10mm.  Specimen bisected, AE 1 block. 
H.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of a lymph node15 x 10 x 10mm.  Specimen bisected, AE 1 block. (TO: OZ: DU/ec 6.6.63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr H Voeltz) 
A.   Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  The tumour invades extensively throughout the myometrium and also involves the cervix.  There is patchy squamous differentiation.  Maximum depth of myometrialinvasion is measured 12mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  No tumour is seen on the serosal surface. There is perineural invasion in the deep myometrium and there is also a lymphovascular invasion inthe myometrium.   Tumour invades the cervical stroma.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is 8mm out of a total stromal thickness of 11mm.  The ectocervical excision margin is free of tumour; tumour is 15mm from the nearest ectocervical excision margin.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The cyst in the left ovary is a simple cyst. The right ovary is unremarkable.  
B.   Sections show fibrofat. No tumour is seen. 
C.   Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
D.   Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
E.   Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
F.   Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
G.  Sections show onelymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
H.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion and cervical stromal invasion. 
Stage 2. 
B.   Omental biopsy:  No tumour.
C.   Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4).
D.   Left obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
E.   Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
F.   Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
G.  Right common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
H.  Left common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
