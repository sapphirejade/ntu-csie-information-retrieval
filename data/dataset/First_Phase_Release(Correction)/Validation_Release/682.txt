Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Left adnexal mass.  Elevated Ca 125.  Breast cancer, ductal ER+ve.  Type 2 DM.  Hypertension, asthma, hyperthyroidism.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary frozen section" consists of an ovarian mass 100 x 80 x 50mm with tube 95 x 8 x 8mm.  The cut surface shows hemogenous tan coloured solid tumour.  The fallopian tube has an unremarkable cut surface.  There is a tan nodule on the serosal surface 22 x 12 x 7mm.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 - representative TS fallopian tube; 4 - allof the fimbrial end; 5 - representative tumour, reserve block; 6 - representative section tumour; 7 & 8 - representative of the surface nodule.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous carcinoma.  
Result to Dr B Brydges by Dr B Mordiniat 12:00pm. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix right tube and ovary" consists of a uteruswith attached cervix, right fallopian tube and ovary weighing 120g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 70 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The non-peritoneal surface of uterus is inked green anteriorly and black posteriorly.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 5mm in thickness over an area measuring approximately 52 x 35mm.  The myometrium is 28mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains possible foci of adenomyosis.  The right fallopian tube measures 65mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  There is a 25 x 22 x 15mm solid mass attached to the external surface of the right fallopian tube over its mid portion.  This mass has a pale solid cut surface.  There also appears to be a nodule at the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube 10mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:1 - 4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 to 14 - the remainder of the thickened endometrium; 15 - ?adenomyosis; 16 to 18 - representative fallopiantube and adjacent mass; 19 - all of the fimbrial end; 20 & 21 - all of the right ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental fatty tissue measuring 455 x 155 x 30mm.  There are numerous pale solid nodules ranging from 2 to 25mm on the surface and within the omentum.  
Blocks: 1 - representatives. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic peritoneum nodule" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 17 x 6mm.  Specimen is serially sliced.  No solid nodules are identified.  AE 1 block.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Peritoneum + pouch of Douglas" consists of multiple fragments of fat and tan solid tissue measuring 55 x 50x 7mm in aggregate.  The larger fragments appear to be covered by peritoneum on one surface.  There are multiple pale solid nodules ranging from 3 to 8mm in maximum dimension over the peritoneum surface.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative sections.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of a vermiform appendix measuring 66mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter with attached mesoappendix and fatty tissue 20 x 16 x 5mm.  There is a tan nodule 3mm in maximum dimension over the serosal surface 10mm from the tip of the appendix.  The cut surface of the appendix are unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - TS serosal nodule close to tip; 2 - remainder of tip; 3 - mid appendix; 4 - base bisected; 5 - mesoappendiceal fatty tissue AE. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Right paracolic gutter" consists of four pieces of fatty tissue 30 x 10 x 6mm in aggregate.  Two pale solid nodules are identified each 5mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid appendix" consists of three pieces of fatty tissue measuring 65 x 40 x 10mm in aggregate.  There are multiple nodular depositsranging from 7 to 15mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks: 1 - representative sections.
I.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" consists of five pieces of pale solid tissue 18 x 9 x 6mm in aggregate.  One of the fragments has a small amount of fatty tissue 6mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.   (ND/ta 4/3/64) 
MICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr B Olsby): 
A.  Sections show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of the left ovary also involving the serosa of the left tube and paradnexal soft tissues.
B.  Sections show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving the uterine serosa, numerous myometrial lymphatics, the serosa of the right tube, the fimbrial end of the right tube and paradnexal soft tissues.  The right ovary is uninvolved.  
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium varies from cystic atrophy to proliferative activity. 
C, D, E, G, H & I.  Sections show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
F.  The appendix shows a small deposit of serous carcinoma on the serosa and within the mesoappendiceal fat.
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of the left ovary also involving the serosa of both tubes, the fimbrial end of the right tube, the uterine serosa, myometrial lymphatics, omentum, peritoneum, appendiceal serosa and sigmoid colon.
