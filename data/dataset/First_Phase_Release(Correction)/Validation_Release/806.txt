CLINICAL:
Tumour at posterior gastric wall - ?GIST.  Superior posterior gastric wall tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Tumour stomach" consists of a tubular segment of stomach 25 x 10 x 10mm with a nodule at one end 32 x 30 x 25mm.  The segment of the stomach has a T shaped stapled line.  The staples are removed and the margins are inked in blue and black as per the diagram.The nodule is covered by smooth shiny serosa.  The nodule has a solid cut surface ranging from pink in centre and pale towards periphery in colour.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections of the nodule (block 3 - reserved block); 4 & 5 - sections through the nodule andthe neo margins.  Please see the diagram.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Nannen)
The gastric tumour is a 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is predominantly circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin and expands the muscularis propria. The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in broad interweaving fascicles. In areas, the tumour cells appear moderately pleomorphic with variably sized nucleoli. There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Centrally, the tumour shows prominent stromal oedema and hyalinosis. Mitoses are present up to 3 per 50 high power fields. Necrosis is inconspicuous. The tumour is largely surrounded by muscularis propria, but focally extends close to, but does not appear to involve, theserosal surface. The tumour is clear of the gastric resection margins (0.56mm). The overlying gastric mucosa shows no significant histologic abnormality. 
Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:
Tumour cells positive for: CD117, CD34.
Tumour cells negative for: SMA, Desmin, S100, CAM5.2.
The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 7% of tumour cell nuclei. 

COMMENT:
The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours less than 50mm in size and with a low mitotic rate (less than 5/50hpf), are typically associated with a low risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM). 
Please correlate with clinical, radiologic and intra-operative findings.


SUMMARY:
Gastric tumour: 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour, close to gastric resection margin (0.56mm) (please see comment).
