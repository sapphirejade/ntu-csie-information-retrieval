Grade 2 endometrial cancer on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by PT
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa weighing 65.4g in total.  The uterus measures 50 x 45 x 25mm and hasa smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable appearance.  The anterior wall inked black and the posterior blue.  On sectioning there is a poorly circumscribed granular mass present in the right posterior endometrium measuring 14 x 12mm in surface area.  Cut sectioning through the tumour shows that the tumour is 4mm in thickness macroscopically and appears to invade the underlying myometrium to a depth of 1mm in a myometrium 12mm in thickness.  The anterior myometrium contains an 8mm fibroid.  No other lesions are identified.  The fallopian tubes measure 60 x 6mm and 56 x 5mm right and left respectively.  The right ovary measures 24 x 12 x 10mm and shows an unremarkable cut surface.  The left ovary measure 20 x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 - deepest invasion of tumour; 8 - right parametrial; 9 - left parametrial; 10 - right fallopian tube and ovary; 11 - left fallopian tube and ovary; 12 - reserved b lock for tissue bank (may contain tumour), the tumour entirely embedded.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 55 x 50 x 12mm containing at least three lymph nodes ranging from 2mm to 25mm in greatest dimension.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - largest node bisected; 3 - two nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 55 x 20 x 12mm containing three lymph nodes ranging from 15mm to 20mm.  Lymph node submitted.
Blocks:  1 - two nodes; 2- one node bisected.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 50mm ingreatest dimension containing three nodes ranging from 15mm to 22mm.  Lymph nodes submitted.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - each block one node.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Rightobturator lymph node" consists of two lymph nodes, 12mm and 30mm in greatest dimension with attached adipose tissue.  Lymph nodes are submitted.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - each one lymph node.  (ZK/mm 29.11.62)

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Joines):  
A.  Sections of uterus show a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1).  The carcinoma shows architectural grade 1 and no solid component is seen.  The tumour cells show nuclear grade 1 to 2.  The carcinoma is confined tothe endometrium and no myometrial invasion is seen.  The tumour is within the uterine corpus and is completely excised.  The endocervix and cervix are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  The rest of endometrium is atrophic and shows no significant abnormality.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The uterine serosa is unremarkable.  Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  Both ovaries are unremarkable.
B.  Three lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
C.  Three lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
D.  Three lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
E.  Two lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of tumour metastasis.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries - Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1).
B.  Left external iliac lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/3).
C.  Left obturator lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/3).
D.  Right iliac lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/3).
E.  Right obturator lymph node - No evidence of malignancy (0/2).
