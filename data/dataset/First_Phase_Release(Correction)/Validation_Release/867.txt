CLINICAL:
(L) breast Ca.  WLE and SLNBX
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sentinel node 1 left breast 2397" consists of a 10mm piece of fatty tissue containing an 8mm lymph node.TAE 1 block.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast sentinel node no 2 1065" consists of a 12mm lymph node withattached adipose tissue.  AE 1 block four pieces.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left breast sentinel node 3 1928" consists of a 10mm lymph node with attached adipose tissue.  TAE 1 block.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Wide local excision left breast short superior, long lateral" consists of a lumpectomy with three marking sutures (short superior, long lateral and the medium assigned as medial) measuring 38mm (medial to lateral), 55mm (superior to inferior) and 45mm (superficial to deep) weighing 51g.  The superficial margin inked red, lateral black and medial blue.  The specimen sequentially sectioned from superior to inferior into 10 slices to reveal an ill defined firm necrotic tumour present in slices 5 to 9.  The tumour measures 18mm (medial to lateral) and 22mm (superficial to deep).  Macroscopically the closest margins are the deep (4mm), medial (5mm), lateral (7mm) and inferior (8mm). The superior and superficial margins are more than 10mm clear.  The remaining breast tissue appears fibrofatty with predominance of fat and no other lesions are identified.  
Blocks:  1 - slice 1 superior end; 2 &3 - slice 3; 4 & 5 - slice 4; 6 to 9 - slice 5; 10 - slice 6; 11 to 13 - slice 7; 14 - slice 8; 15 to 18 - slice 9; 19 to 22 - slice 10 inferior slice.  Please refer to attached diagram.  (OT/mm 1.3.62)

ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (Reported by Dr T Erxleben 16.1.62)
Four unstained slides were sent to DONNYBROOK HOSPITAL Hospital for Her2 CISH analysis:
Her 2 in situ hydridisation: (Her2 CISH Invitrogen SPOT-Light assay, block D14). 
Her2 CISH result: NEGATIVE (non-amplified, diploid).
Mean Her2 copy number per cell: 1.6.
SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):
1 to <2.5 copies:  	Non amplified (diploid)
2.5 to <4 copies:  	Non amplified (polysomy) 
4 to 6 copies:		Equivocal 
>6 but < 10 copies:	Low level amplification
10 or more copies: 	High level amplified.
