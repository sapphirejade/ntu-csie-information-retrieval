CLINICAL:
Right mastectomy. 
Additional clinical history: Previous right breast invasive ductal carcinoma in 2046. Now 4-5 month history of lump lateral to nipple. Biopsy proven angiosarcoma done privately.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right breast mastectomy, short superior, long lateral", consists of a mastectomy (sutures taken as described), measuring 280mm (medial to lateral) x 170mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep). There is skin including nipple measuring 210mm (medial to lateral) x 125mm (superior to inferior).  The skin has a defect at 9 o'clock, 75mm from the nipple (39mm from the superior skin margin, 30mm from the inferior skin margin, 70mm from the lateral skin margin) covering an area of 35mm (superior to inferior) x 30mm (medial to lateral). In this area the skin is indurated with focal erythematous macules and a ?surgical artefact measuring 20mm (superior to inferior).There is a linear ?scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 40mm (medial to lateral). The remainder of the skin surface is unremarkable. Deep margin inked black, rest of surgical margin inked green.  On sectioning there is an ill defined firm lesion ?fibrosis/?tumour in the upper outer quadrant measuring approximately 15mm (medial to lateral) x 15mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (superficial to deep). It is located up to 12mm from the nearest deep surgical margin and 45mm from the nipple.  Some ?fibrotic area appears to extend to the deep margin in the upper outer quadrant.  
Block 1 - representative nipple; 2 - representative skin lesion at surgical incision; 3-7 - representative ?tumour/?fibrosis; 8 - closest surgical margin with ? fibrosis; 9 & 10 - surgical margin with muscle layer present; 11 - representative tissue deep to nipple; 12 - representative lower outer quadrant; 13 - representative tissue lower inner quadrant; 14 - representative tissue upper inner quadrant; 15 - representative tissue upper outer quadrant; 16 - representative section of ?scar; 17 - 19 - superior skin margin;20-22 - inferior skin margin; 23-25 lateral skin margin; 26-27 superior green surgical margin; 28 - deep margin near fibrosis with skeletal muscle.  
(ED/ec  2.9.62)  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Z Zarlenga): 
Sections show high gradeangiosarcoma situated within the vicinity of the surgical scar seen on the skin surface.  The tumour shows positive staining with CD31, and is negative for Cam5.2.  Although a great deal of the tumour is centred within the dermis, there is extensive infiltration of underlying adipose tissue and tumour focally reaches the deep resection margin.  The size of the tumour is difficult to estimate, however measures at least 20mm across.  Representative sections taken at the edge of the skin ellipse and also at the superior and inferior soft tissue margins show no evidence of tumour.  The remaining breast tissue and nipple show no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast:
- High grade angiosarcoma
- Positive deepmargin
- Peripheral skin and soft tissue margins clear of tumour
