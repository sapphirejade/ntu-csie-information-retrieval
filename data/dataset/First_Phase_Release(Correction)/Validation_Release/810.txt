MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by  YQ/lj
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 60g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 25mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Anteriorly there is an endometrial polyp 30 x 20 x12mm.  The myometrium is focally thickened up to 19mm and contains three fibroids ranging from 10 to 17mm in maximum dimension.  All fibroids have whorled grey cut surfaces.  The right ovary measures 35 x 8 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm in length and up to 12mm in diameter, and is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 50  x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.The left fallopian tube is 50mm in length and up to 10mm in diameter and is unremarkable.   
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (block 3 contains base of the endometrial polyp); 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 - section of anterior endomyometrium including part of polyp; 8 to 10 - the remainder of the endometrial polyp; 11 & 12 - all of the right ovary; 13 - representatives right fallopian tube including all of the fimbrial end; 14 to 16 - all of the left ovary; 17 - representative TS left fallopian tube; 18 - all of the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube; 19 & 20 -remainder of the left fallopian tube; 21 - remainder of the right fallopian tube.  The fallopian tubes are blocked in total.  (RP/mm 15.11.62) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental fatty tissue 200 x 70 x 28mm.There is an indurated nodule with a pale/yellow cut surface 35 x 30 x 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections of the nodule; 3 - reserve block for tumour bank.  (RA/ta 13/11/62) 
 
   
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Kranawetter): 
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that the described polyp is benign.  The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Focally on the serosa of the anteriorand posterior uterus there are psammoma bodies with associated fibrous tissue and very occasional degenerate tumour cells.  The features are consistent with focal serosal involvement by treated tumour.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma quite extensively involving the tube wall and serosa, and also extending to involve part of the mucosa.  No carcinoma in situ is identified in the residual tubal lining epithelium or at the fimbrial end.    
Sections of the right fallopian tube show scattered foci of serous carcinoma in the tube wall and at the fimbrial end.   
Sections of both ovaries show very occasional small serosal and sub-serosal tumour deposits but the ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  
B.  Sections show omentum with one large deposit and multiple other deposits of serous carcinoma.  This is moderately differentiated.  There is some evidence of chemotherapy effect with some replacement of tumour by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.  This is assessed as less than 50% tumour replacement by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue. 
Comment:  The involvement of the wall of the left fallopian tube is quite extensive and there is some mucosal involvement but the pattern of tumour suggests spread inwards from the serosa, rather than tubal origin.  The tumour is most likely primary peritoneal.
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr O Haarstad.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  
1.  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving both fallopian tubes and focally involving serosa of uterus and both ovaries.    
2.  Benign endometrial polyp and leiomyomas.
B.  Omentum:  Serous carcinoma.
