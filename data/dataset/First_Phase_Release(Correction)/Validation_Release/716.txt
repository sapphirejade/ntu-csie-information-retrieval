DR FLORENE Noemi BROUWERS
Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, elevated Ca-125.  8 falls, R hip replacement.  Right tube and ovary frozen section.  Ca125 79.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a distorted 110 x 70 x 60mm solid and cystic tumour (predominantly solid) with a cream/yellow cut surface.  The cystic component has a smooth external and internal surface; papillary excrescences are not seen.  A distinct ovary is not identified. There is an apparent segment of distorted fallopian tube present, 20 x 15mm.
FS: 1 - representative solid; 2 - representative solid and cystic.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - remainder of frozen section tissue 1; 3 to 6 - representative tube; 7 to 16 - representative tumour (block 14 - tumour reserve block).
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma (favour Mullerian primary).
Phone result to Dr X Hackborn by Dr X Golson/Dr X Stromeski on 14/1/13 at 1515hr.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a grey mass of tissue measuring 40 x 33 x 25mm.  Sectioning shows a distorted cystic ovary.  There is a segment of tube present which measures 25 x 5mm.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - tube; 3 to 9 - rest of specimen including ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right ovarian pedicle" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 27 x 8 x 5mm.  There is a suture present on one aspect.  Serially sectioned, AE three blocks. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of two separate pieces of tissue with nodes, one measuring up to 20 x 10 x 6mm and the other measuring 25 x 15 x 5mm.  One node is identified in piece one.  Three nodes are identified in piece two, ranging from 8 to 10mm.  :  1 - node from piece #1 TAE; 2 - three nodes AE.
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a portion of omentum measuring 460 x 200 x 10mm.  Two small firm white lesions are identified, one 3mm and the other 5mm.  
Blocks:  1 - 5mm piece BAE, 3mm lesion AE; 2 & 3 - representative omentum.   (XM/cc  17/3/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Majano): 
A.  Sections show ovary with a poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  Much of this consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a moderate amount of amphophilic cytoplasm.  Some of the tumour, however, shows formation of papillary structures and slit-like spaces.  There is rather prominent, patchy tumour necrosis.  Tumour involves ovary and also the adjacent fimbrial end ofthe fallopian tube.  The tube elsewhere is dilated.  No carcinoma in situ of tubal epithelium is seen.  Tumour involves the serosal surface of the ovary at least focally. 
B.  Sections show ovary and fallopian tube.  There isfibro fat adherent to the ovary and there are small epithelial inclusion cysts within the ovary and in parovarian soft tissue.  There is also focal endometriosis in parovarian tissue.  No tumour is seen.  The fallopian tube does not show any significant abnormality. 
C.  Sections show fibrofat with small muscular vessels and nerves.  Tumour is present within a small vessel, probably a lymphatic, focally.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable. 
D.  Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections omentum show two small lymph nodes, corresponding to the described firm white lesions seen macroscopically.The nodes are unremarkable.  No tumour is seen.      
Representative slides of the right ovarian tumour have also been viewed by Dr X Kemmerling.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Right tube and ovary:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of ovary. 
B.  Left tube and ovary:  Focal endometriosis in parovarian tissue.
C.  Right ovarian pedicle:  Focal tumour in a small vessel.  
D.  Right common iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4).  
E.  Omentum:  No tumour.
