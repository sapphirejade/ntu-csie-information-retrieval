HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Status post R hemicolectomy for appendicular adenocarcinoma with peritoneal recurrence on exploration nodule of hard found at the ileocolic anastomosis which has been sent for frozen to decide upon that for the revision of anastomosis.  Peritoneal nodule at ileocolic anastomosis.  R perinephric peritoneum.  Peritoneal nodule.  Wound.  Gallbladder mesh, omentum, falciform and peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL SURFACE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of firm pink tissue 10mm maximum diameter with multiple metal staples. Staples removed and a section of soft tissue examined.

F/S : &amp;quot;No evidence of malignancy. Await further examination of the rest of the tissue including area of staples&amp;quot;.  Reported to Fellow by Dr. V. Towery at 1010am on 26.12.18.

(1 FS; 2 remainder). AE (M-2)

B.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, MESH, FALCIFORM PERITONEUM&amp;quot;.  Consists of gallbladder, omentum and multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue consistent with peritoneum.  The gallbladder measures 90mm in length with a maximum diameter of 25mm. It is collapsed. The serosal surface is smooth and unremarkable.  On opening the lumen, no stones are found the lumen. The mucosa is granular green in appearance.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus)

Omentum measures 460x180x20mm.  No firm areas or suspicious areas are identified on palpation or sectioning.

(3&amp;amp;4 RS of omentum)

The separate pieces of fibrofatty pieces of tissue altogether measures 180x110x20mm.  One of the pieces has surgical staples and ? muscle.  On sectioning this piece there is mesh attached.

(5&amp;amp;6 RS of fibrofatty pieces of tissue).  RS (M-6)

C.  &amp;quot;WOUND&amp;quot;. Consists of three pieces of tissue, two comprise of skin ellipses with underlying subcutaneous tissue. The third piece is a piece of fibrofatty tissue ? consistent with peritoneum.  First piece with overlying skin measures 70x15x65mm.  The skin surface is unremarkable.  It is consistent with umbilicus.  On sectioning there is blue material consistent with ? suture.

(1&amp;amp;2 piece taken from umbilicus)

The second piece with overlying skin ellipse measures 75x5mm and is up to 85mm in depth.  The skin surface appears unremarkable.

(4&amp;amp;5 second piece)

The third piece consistent with peritoneum measures 45x15mm and is up to 10mm in depth.

(6 third piece). RS (M-6)

D.  &amp;quot;RIGHT PERINEPHRIC PERITONEUM&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of tissue consistent with peritoneum.  It measures 105x45x6mm.

(1&amp;amp;2 RS).  RS (M-2)

E.  &amp;quot;PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;.  Consists of three pieces of tissue comprising of two nodules and a small piece of fibrofatty tissue, altogether 20x15x5mm.  AE (M-1/MC/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. V Strimel)
A. Sections show small bowel. In the wall, there are multiple foci of foreign body giant cell granulomas. Some of the granulomas contain debris and suture type material. Surrounding the granulomas, there is fibrous scarring. No evidence of malignancy.

B. Sections of gallbladder show changes of chronic cholecystitis. The omental fat shows focal collection of xanthomatous histiocytes. Scattered foreign body giant cell granulomas containing vacuoles are noted. Foreign body material is identified within the vacuoles. No evidence of malignancy.

C. Sections show skin in which there is a scar associated with foreign body giant cell reaction. No evidence of recurrent tumour.

D. Sections show strips of peritoneal tissue in which there is congestion and focal fibrosis. No evidence of malignancy.

E. Sections of peritoneal nodule show fat necrosis surrounded by fibrosis consistent with appendix epiploicae. The other piece of tissue show cystically dilated spaces lined by mesothelial  cells consistent with epithelial inclusion cysts. No evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SMALL BOWEL SURFACE
- FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELL REACTION.

B. GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM, MESH, FALCIFORM PERITONEUM
- CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS AND FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELL REACTION INVOLVING OMENTUM.

C. WOUND
- FIBROUS SCAR WITH FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELL REACTION.

D. RIGHT PERINEPHRIC PERITONEUM
- NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.


E. PERITONEAL NODULE
- APPENDIX EPIPLOICAE AND EPITHELIAL INCLUSION CYSTS.
