CLINICAL:
Uterine cancer.  Adenocarcinoma uterus.  Uterine Ca met.  Pt is on aromatase inhibitor clinical trial.  NB a small wedge of tumour was taken from capsule for Dr Fickett's liver tissue bank.  Pt has also consented for MEDIC/SURGERY WARD biobank.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a wedge of liver measuring up to 135 x 105 x 45mm and weighing 367.2g post fixation.  There is a tumour measuring 112 x up to 85 x 49mm.  It is adjacent to the capsular surface.  It is lobulated, firm, white to cream with areas of patchy focal haemorrhage and necrosis.  The tumour takes up about 80% of the volumes of the specimen.  The sections of normal liver are unremarkable.  The tumour extends to within 2mm of the posterior surgical margin. 
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative normal liver; 3 - tumour with closest deep surgical margin; 4 - reserved block; 5 & 6 - tumour abutting capsular surface; 7 - representative tumour with haemorrhage.  (JS/mm 16.2.62)  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Ruschel):
Sections of liver show metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.   The CK7 stain is focally positive and the CK20 stain is negative consistent with a gynaecological primary.  Extensive necrosis is present, possibly treatment related.  Although grade 1 areas arepresent, focally the tumour shows grade 3 architecture.  The tumour comes to within 1.5mm of the surgical resection margin and abuts the liver capsule but does not breach it.  The adjacent liver shows no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:  
Liver:
-   Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
-   Excision appears complete.
