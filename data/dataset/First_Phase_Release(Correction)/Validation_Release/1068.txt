CLINICAL:
Retroperitoneal tumour en bloc - (L) kidney + descending colon.  Prev radiotherapy 4/52 ago.  Leiomyosarcoma (R) retroperitoneum - small bowel.  Aorta (?scar ?tumour) + cytogenetics.  (Previous review - 67Z94660), lung secondaries.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal sarcoma" consists of en bloc resection of left kidney, 95 x 60 x 47mm, segment of descending colon, 210mm in length and 35mm in diameter and attached nodular large firm mass measuring 185 x 130 x 100mm.  The kidney has a smooth external surface and is continuity with a long segment of ureter with a catheter in place, 150mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  The large bowel shows no unusual features.  The tumour appears nodular and is situated within the pericolic fat and focally firmly attached to the ureter.  The anterior aspect of the tumour inked blue, the lateral black and the posterior (deep) green.  Posteriorly and along the ureter the specimen is longitudinally disrupted (inked red).  The tumour appears firmly attached to the ureter over a length of 50mm which lies approximately 45mm from pelvis.  Sectioning through the tumour shows a solid, cream pale tan cut surface with areas of necrosis (<10%) and myxoid areas.  The tumour seems to abut all resection margins in multiple areas.  The kidney shows no unusual features on sectioning.  
Blocks:  1 - proximal margin of colon; 2- distal margin of colon; 3 & 4 - kidney; 5 - ureteric margin and ureteropelvic junction; 6 - tumour superior margin; 7 - inferior tumour; 8 & 9 - anterior tumour; 10 - medial tumour; 11 - lateral tumour; 12 to 16 - tumour adherent to ureter; 17 - tumour anterior colic fat; 18 to 20 - pericolic fat with possible lymph nodes; 21 - random; 22 - reserved block.  Fresh tissue was taken for cytogenetics.  

B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel resection" consists of a segment of stapled small bowel, 140mm in length, 22mm in diameter with attached mesentery up to 28mm in width.  The serosal surface appears congested and focally is ragged over an area of approximately 15mm across.  The mucosa shows no unusual features.  
Blocks:  1- margins; 2 & 3 - LS full thickness with abnormal serosa; 4 & 5 - mesentery.
C.  Specimen labelled"Aorta" consists of a piece of irregularly shaped greyish tissue with attached blood clot measuring 5 x 3 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by DrP Eggett):
A.  Sections show a large retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma which measures approximately 185 x 130 x 100mm.  The sarcoma has previously been classified as grade 2 using the FNCLCC system (tumour differentiation -1, mitotic count -3, tumour necrosis -0 - total score of 4). The resected tumour shows an estimated 10% tumour necrosis and prominent mitotic activity (greater than 20 per 10 hpf) as well as marked pleomorphism of the spindle cells (this is interpreted as a poor response to radiotherapy).  
The deep and superior margins of resection appear positive and the inferior margin is less than 0.1mm clear.  The anterior margin is 0.2mm clear and the lateral margin 0.1mm clear.  The medial margin is estimated at 5mm clearance.  The tumour invades the muscularis of the left ureter and almost reaches the lining urothelium. The tumour also invades the mesentery of the descending colon but does not directly invade this segment of large bowel.  The kidney also is not invaded by tumour and appears normal.  The small pericolic lymph nodes identified are negative for tumour. 
B.  The peritoneal surfaceof the small bowel shows focal small deposits of  leiomyosarcoma. These measure 0.5-1mm in maximal dimension.  
C.  Sections show fibrofatty adventitia and clot. There is no tumour present.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A, B, C. Left retroperitoneal sarcoma, small bowel resection, aorta:
-   Retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma, size 185 x 130 x 100mm.  
-   Margins: Superior positive, deep positive, inferior less than 0.1mm, anterior 
    0.2mm, lateral 0.1mm, medial 5mm.  
-   Poor response to radiotherapy (estimated necrosis - 10%, high mitotic rate).
-   Invasion of the wall of the left ureter.
-   Tumour deposits - peritoneal surface of small bowel segment.
-   Normal kidney and descending colon.  (ec)
