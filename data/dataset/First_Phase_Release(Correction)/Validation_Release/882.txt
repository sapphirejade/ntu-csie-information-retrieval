Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
ILC left breast -> L axilla sentinel node biopsy.  ILC left breast 11-2 o'clock -> mastectomy and left axilla sampling. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla sentinel node 1", consists of a piece of fatty tissue with node measuring 15mm. Serially sectioned, AE 1 block.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY:  No tumour seen. 
Reported to theatre nurse by Dr X Felicano at 10:00am on 6.12.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla sentinel node biopsy", consists of one irregular node measuring up to 20 x 7 x 4mm.  Serially TS.  Tissue AE 1 block. 
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY:  NO MALIGNANT CELLS IDENTIFIED. 
Reported to theatre nurse by Dr X Rachell at 10:00am on 6.12.12.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left axilla lymph node", consists of three pieces of tan fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 20 x 20 x 10mm.  There are multiple lymph nodes identified measuring 5mm to 11mm in diameter.  Block 1 largest node; 2 - remainder of lymph nodes.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left breast stitch short superior, long lateral", consists of a breast measuring 205 x 165 x 55mm with overlying skin measuring 110 x 65mm.  The unremarkable nipple is centrally located.  Two marking sutures are present: long stitch lateral, short stitch superior.  The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue.  On sectioning there is an extensive ill defined firm tumour/fibrosis located in the upper inner and outer quadrants extending centrally measuring up to 70mm (medial to lateral) x 80mm (superior to inferior) x40mm (superficial to deep).  It appears macroscopically clear of the deep surgical margin (5mm).  The tumour is well clear of the superficial margin (more than 12mm).  The remainder of the sections show fibrous fatty breast tissue.  
Block 1 - nipple; 2-6 - tumour upper outer quadrant (4 - Reserve block); 7 - tumour lower outer quadrant; 8 - fibrotic area near nipple; 9 - margin lower outer quadrant; 10 - margin upper inner quadrant; 11 - margin upper outer quadrant; 12 to 15 - representative normal breast tissue (12 - upper inner quadrant; 13 - lower inner quadrant; 14 - lower outer quadrant; 15 - upper outer quadrant). (VR/ec  2.9.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Vautier)
A.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is involved by metastatic lobular carcinoma measuring 5mm in diameter.  No extranodal spread is seen.
B.  One (1) lymph node is identified.  The lymph node is involved by several deposits of metastatic lobular carcinoma measuring up to 1.8mm in diameter.  No extranodal spread is seen.
C.  Four (4) lymph nodes are identified.  The lymph nodes are unremarkable.  There isno evidence of tumour metastasis.
D.  Sections of breast show invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 80mm in diameter.  The carcinoma scores grade 2 (T-3, N-2, M-1).  Lymphovascular invasion is focally present.  No DCIS or LCIS component is seen.  The carcinoma is completely excised.  The invasive carcinoma is 3.5mm to the deep margin (block D10) and is well clear of the other margins.The tumour cells are positive for ER and PR.  The stain for HER-2 is negative (1+ staining).  The nipple is unremarkable.  The rest of breast shows benign fibrocystic change.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (26/2/2062):
Block D11 was sent to DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Hospital for Her-2 in-situ Hybridisation analysis:
Signal Detection has been performed for the HER-2 gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventana INFORM HER-2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche).
HER-2 ISH result:  Negative (non-amplified, diploid)
Her-2 copy number per cell: 1.5
Mean CEP17 copy number per cell: 1.25
HER-2/CEP ratio: 1.2
SCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):
Negative:  	HER-2/CEP17 < 1.8
Equivocal:  	HER-2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2
Positive:  	HER-2/CEP17 > 2.2
