Serous endometrial cancer on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left and right tube + ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa weighing 105g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 55 x 45mm and has beenopened from the right lateral wall prior to receipt.  The serosal surface shows patchy haemorrhage but is otherwise unremarkable.  The ectocervix measures 28 x 25mm and shows areas of haemorrhage.  On sectioning, most of the endometrium isless than 1mm in thickness.  The anterior endometrium has a fungating, soft, ? necrotic tumour 28 x 18 x 9mm.  No definite myometrial invasion is identified.  The myometrium is 15mm in thickness deep to the tumour.  A 22mm fibroid is present in the postero-superior uterine wall, at the fundus.  The right fallopian tube including fimbria measures 50 x 7mm and the left fallopian tube measures 45 x 8mm, including fimbria.  The right ovary measures 35 x 10 x 7mm.  Sectioning shows no unusual features.  The left ovary measures 30 x 15 x 8mmand shows no unusual features on sectioning.  The anterior cervical wall is inked black and the posterior red.     Blocks 1-4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5 - additional sectionof tumour and myometrium; 6-9 - 1 full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 - fibroid; 11 - right parametria; 12 - left parametria; 13 - right ovary; 14 - right fallopian tube; 15 - left ovary; 16 - left fallopian tube;17 - reserved block for tissue banking.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of two nodes 18mm and 23mm in greatest dimension with attached adipose tissue.  Block 1- smaller node; 2 & 3 - larger node.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a 30mm lymph node with a small amount of attached adipose tissue. AE 2 blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of two nodes 10mm and 9mm with attached adipose tissue.  Lymph nodes submitted in 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled"Left external iliac lymph node", consists of three nodes ranging between 15-35mm in greatest dimension.  Block 1 - one node; 2 - one node; 3 & 4 - largest node. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of a 10mm lymph node with attached fibroadipose tissue. AE 1 block.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a 24mm lymph node with attached adipose tissue.  Lymph node submitted in 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "Omentum biopsy", consists of a portion of omentum 180 x 108 x 15mm showing no unusual features.  3 representative blocks. (DF/ec  28.9.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr B Halik) 
A.  Sections of the tumour in the anterior endometrium show a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  This consists of papillary structures and some slit-like glands lined by epithelial cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is invasion of myometrium in the stalk of the polypoid tumour but not more deeply into myometrium.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 2mm where total myometrial thickness is 20mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Sections of the endometrium elsewhere show that much of this is superficiallyinvolved by serous carcinoma.  Serous carcinoma extends into the lower segment but no definite cervical involvement is seen.  The sections of cervix are unremarkable.  There is extensive adenomyosis throughout the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tube are unremarkable. 
B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
C.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
D.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show three lymph nodes.   No tumour is seen. 
F.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
G.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.  
H.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of endometrium showing superficial myometrial invasion.  Stage 1A.  
B.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
C.  Right obturator lymph node:No tumour (0/1).
D.  Right common iliac lymph nodes:   No tumour (0/2).
E.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
F.  Left common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
G.  Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).  
H.  Biopsy omentum:  No tumour.
