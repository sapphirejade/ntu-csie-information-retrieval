CLINICAL:
Grade I endometrial cancer on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 80g in total.  The specimen was received opened.  The uterus measures 60 x 40 x 38mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a full thickness defect measuring 25mm in length that dissects through the endometrium and myometrium through an area of tumour (inked red).  The anterior serosal surfaceof the uterus is inked blue and the posterior serosal surface of the uterus is inked black.  On sectioning there is an exophytic tumour in the anterior left endometrium over an area of 25 x 20mm extending to the posterior left surface.The full thickness defect transects through the tumour area inked red.  The tumour is 44mm from the cervical os and does not appear to invade through to the serosa.  The tumour appears to obscure the left uterine cornu.  The tumour is10mm from the right cornu.  The endometrium elsewhere is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 18mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length x 8mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures25 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 26 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. 
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 7 to 10 - posterior endometrial tumour all embedded; 11 to 15 - anterior endometrial tumour and full thickness defect (80% oftumour embedded); 16 - right ovary; 17- right cornu; 18 - right fallopian tube; 19 & 20 - left ovary all embedded; 21 - ?left cornu; 22 to 24 - left fallopian tube all embedded.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 8 x 5mm encasing one lymph node 10 x 5 x 5mm.  Specimen BAE 1 block.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 65 x 35 x 13mm.  No lymph nodes were found.  Representative in 3 blocks.  (VZ/mm 20.5.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr V Stoud - 21.5.2063)
A.  The uterine tumour is a grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists complex, crowded and infiltrative glands with minimal intervening stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGA architecture grade 2; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 2). The remaining endometrium shows complex atypical hyperplasia. The carcinoma infiltrates 6.6mm through a uterine wall 15mm thick. There is focal lymphovascular space invasion. No serosal involvement is seen. The bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant histologic abnormality. 
B.  Sections of the left external lymph node show no evidence ofmalignancy (0/1). 
C.  Sections show fragments of fibroadipose tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative slides seen with Dr V Weldin.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, tubes and ovaries:
Grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Focal lymphovascular space invasion.
No evidence of serosal involvement. 
Bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality. 

B.  Left external lymphnode: No evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

C.  Omental biopsy: No evidence of malignancy.
