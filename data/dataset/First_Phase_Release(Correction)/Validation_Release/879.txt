CLINICAL:
Pancreatic Ca.  Pancreatic body tumour.  Left wrist amyloidosis.  Type II DM.  Bilateral synovitis - knee arthroscopy.  Mitral regurgitation.  HTN.  Ovarian cysts.  Interstitial cystitis.  [1. Distal pancreas.  2. Spleen.  3. Greater omentum].
[Additional clinical history obtained by Dr Tidrick:  The two long sutures are attached to the neck and the short suture is attached to the inferoanterior aspect.  The spleen was initially attached to the specimen but became dislodged.  The specimen includes the left adrenal gland at the superior aspect.  The tumour occluded the splenic vein and was adherent to the portal vein and the superior mesenteric vessels.  The associated fat at the lateral aspect is probable perinephric fat. Patient has finished course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy].
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Pancreas" consists of an excision of the body/tail of pancreas 95mm(medial-lateral) x 70mm (inferior-superior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  There are two large sutures attached to the neck while a small suture is attached to the superficial inferior margin.  The pancreatic neck margin is inked green, the anterior margin is inked blue, the posterior margin over the portal vein margin is inked black and the remainder of the posterior margin is inked red.After the neck margin is shaved the cut surface is inked purple.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the parasagittal plane into fifteen slices from slice 1 medial to slice 15 lateral.  A firm cream relatively well-circumscribed tumouris identified in slices 2 to 11.  The tumour measures 36mm (medial-lateral) x 28mm (inferior-superior) x 17mm (superficial-deep).  The distance from margins is as follows: the tumour is 7mm from the medial margin, 5mm from the superior margin, 6mm from the inferior margin, is well clear of the lateral margin but appears to abut the anterior and deep margins.The tumour appears to surround a large blood vessel in the superior portion.  
Blocks:  1 - shave of neck margin; 2 - slice 1; 3 - slice 3; 4 & 5 - slice 5; 6 & 7 - slice 6; 8& 9 - slice 8; 10 & 11 - slice 9; 12 - superior portion of slice 10; 13 & 14 - slice 13; 15 & 16 - LS of slice 15 (lateral margin); 17 - reserve block.  Please refer to attached diagram and photographs.
B.  Specimen labelled "Spleen" consists of a spleen 115 x 65 x 35mm.  The capsule appears unremarkable.The cut surface appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 - vascular margins; 2 to 5 - representative sections.
C.  Specimenlabelled "Greater omentum" consists of a piece of omentum 240 x 120 x 15mm.  No suspicious areas are identified.  Representative sections in three blocks.   (RR/cc  1/1/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Pitorak): 
A.   Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body. The tumour shows extrapancreatic spread and is associated with an desmoplastic stroma. Tumour is present in slices 3 to 11 (total of 15 parasagittal slices) and has an estimated size of 36mm (medial to lateral) x 28mm (superior to inferior) x 17mm (superficial to deep). There is prominent perineural invasion at the advancing edge but no lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Some of the many peripancreatic nodes identified are involved by direct tumour spread but there is no metastatic spread to peripancreatic and splenic hilar lymph nodes.
Carcinoma is seen 0.1mm from the portal vein bed (margin regarded as positive) and is seen 0.2mm from the adjacent posterior pancreatic margin (regarded as positive). The pancreatic neck margin has an estimated clearance of 8mm (2 slices) and the lateral (splenic margin) appears well clear. Carcinoma is present at the anterior border of the pancreas.  
The pancreas shows atrophy of the exocrine pancreas with retained islets and the adrenal gland shows no abnormality.
B.   The spleen and splenic hilum show no abnormality. 
C.   The greater omentum shows no abnormality.   (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A, B, C.  Pancreas (distal), spleen, omentum:
-   Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (of pancreatic body) with desmoplastic stroma and extrapancreatic spread, size 36 x 28 x 17mm, perineural invasion.   
-  Pancreatic neck margin 8mm clear.
-  Positive posterior margin (portal vein bed).
-  No lymph node metastases (direct spread only).
-Normal spleen, omentum and adrenal gland.
