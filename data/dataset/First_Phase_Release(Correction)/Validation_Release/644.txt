CLINICAL:
Ca prostate Gl 7.  Total hip replacement rt sided.  Prostate and SVs, R and L pelvic.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate" consists of a prostate measuring 45mm medial to lateral, 50mm superior to inferior and 33mm anterior to posterior and weighing 54.4g.  The right vas deferens measures 12mm and the left measures 15mm in length.The right seminal vesicle measures 15 x 18 x 6mm and the left measures 12 x 13 x 6mm.  The left half is inked blue and the right black with anterior green.  The prostate is TS into 7 slices.  Slice 1 (apex) and 7 (base) are further parasagittally sectioned.  Specimen AE.
Blocks:  1 to 18 - (apex) from left to right; 19 to 23 - TS through the body of the prostate (blocks 22 and 23 some posterior tangential sectioning); 24 to 37 - (slice 7) base from right to left; 38- LS of the left vas deferens; 39 & 40 - LS of the left seminal vesicle; 41 - TS of the right vas deferens; 42 & 43 - LS of the right seminal vesicle.
Please note.  Microscopy shows that slice 5 is the prostate base, slice 6are seminal vesicles and parasaggital sections of slice 7 are, in fact, of the seminal vesicles (vk).
B.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 55 x 25 x 10mm.  The tissue appears to contain one lymph node which is largely replaced by fatty tissue.  All potential lymph node tissue embedded in 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue which measures55 x 35 x 10mm.  Blocks:  1 - lymph nodes; 2 & 4 - one presumed lymph node in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Doeberling):
The prostate has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show an acinar adenocarcinoma with the following features:
Histological type:  Acinar adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour location:
Dominant nodule: Right posterior prostate crossing into right anterior quadrant and contiguously extending from the right apex to the right base and extensively involving the right seminal vesicle.
	Non-dominant (>10mm): Not seen.
	Smaller nodules:  Present (right anterior apex and left posterior mid prostate).
Volume/Size:	approximately 8.2ml (24mm x 17mm x 50mm (superior to inferior prostate) x 0.0004)
		-  Not including a proportion of right seminal vesicle component. 
Gleason score:  4 + 3 (dominant nodule). 
Extraprostatic extension:  Present; (right anterolateral mid prostate (A20)) and right seminal vesicle with extensive extraseminal vesicle extension (A23, A24).
Surgical margins:  Positive
1) at right anterior mid prostate over a length 0.5mm (extraprostatic), Gleason grade 4 (A20).
2) at right seminal vesicle (A26, A42) and right lateral extraprostatic tissue lateral to right seminal vesicle (A24) - estimate up to six foci over a length of up to 8mm (A42), Gleason grade 4.
Perineural invasion:  Present; extensive. 
Seminal vesicles:  Right seminal vesicle extensively involved by direct extension from base of prostate, extensive extraseminal vesicle extension including foci of perineural invasion.
Lymph nodes (specimens B&C):  Not involved (four negativepelvic nodes 0/4).
Lymphovascular invasion: Not seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A-D.  Prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes:
-  Acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4 + 3 =7
-  Extraprostatic and extraseminal vesicle extension (see above)
-  Positive margins(see above)
-- Four negative pelvic lymph nodes
-  Stage (AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition) T3b (Seminal vesicle invasion) N0.
