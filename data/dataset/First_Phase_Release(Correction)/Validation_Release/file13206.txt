CLINICAL NOTES:
Right axillary sentinel node for frozen section. Right breast cancer further surrounding margins (whole cavity), long-lateral, medium-medial, short-superior.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of two lymph nodes 8, 7mm, pink.
F/S: &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;. Results were given by phone on 29/4/2069 by Dr. C. Blinston.
(1  transverse section LN 1 and 2; 2  remainder LN 1; 3  remainder LN 2).  Representative sections. (M-3).

&amp;quot;Short - superior, Medium - medial, Long - lateral.&amp;quot;
SPECIMEN SIDE: Right
SPECIMEN TYPE:  Wide local excision, oriented.
SPECIMEN X-RAY:  Yes, there is a marker at H8 and hookwire split at F8. Overlying area of the marker is inked yellow.
HOOKWIRE:  Yes, entering the specimen supra-anteriorly.
SPECIMEN DIMENSIONS:
Medial to lateral:  35mm
Superior to inferior:  40mm
Anterior to posterior:  55mm
WEIGHT:  39g
SKIN:  No
NIPPLE:  No

OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  Not applicable.
MARGIN INKED:  Non-Standard: Superior red, Inferior green, Medial blue, Lateral black.
DISSECTION: Cut from anterior to posterior
Number of slices:  10
FINDINGS / LESION:  There is a lesion identified in slices 3 and 4 with adjacent focal area of haemorrhage ?previous biopsy tract. The lesion has a tan cut surface and it measures 5mm medial to lateral, 4mm superior to inferior, 8mm anterior to posterior. The tumour is 9mm from superior margin, 22mm from inferior margin, 4mm from medial margin, 20mm from lateral margin, 8mm from anterior margin and 28mm from posterior margin. The remainder of the breast tissue is fibrofatty in appearance. Entire lesion is embedded.
