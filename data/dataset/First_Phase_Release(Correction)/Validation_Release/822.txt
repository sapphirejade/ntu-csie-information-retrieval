Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Radical vulvectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Vulva stitch at 12 o'clock", consists of a radical vulvectomy with a suture for orientation 12 o'clock.  Specimen measures 100 x 80 x 7mm.  A possible urethral orifice is identified and measures 7mm in diameter(block 8).  There are multiple pigmented patchy lesions throughout the specimen with a large ulcerated lesion at the left aspect of specimen measuring 30 x 25mm.  The 12 o'clock margin of the specimen is inked blue, the 6 o'clock margin black.  The specimen is AE according to the attached diagram.  
Blocks: 1 - 9 o'clock margin; 2 to 22 - serial sections of vulvectomy embedded from 9 to 3 o'clock; 23 - 3 o'clock margin. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left inguinal lymph node", consists of an irregular piece of fattytissue containing eight lymph nodes ranging from 5 to 15mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right inguinal lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue containing 10 lymph nodes.  : 1 to 6 - lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right anterior mons lesion", consists of a skin tag 10 x 5 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block.   (TO: LV;XU/vo 7.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. E Grossi):
A.  Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left vulva.  The carcinoma has a depth of 2mm, a length of 17mm and an estimated width of 21mm.  The carcinoma is 2mm from the 6 o'clock margin,6mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 7mm from the 12 o'clock margin and 6mm from the deep margin.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
There is a tiny well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right vulva with a depth of 0.5mm and a length of 1.5mm.This is well clear of all other margins.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
High grade VIN is present at the 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins.
(The orifice in block 8 which was thought to possibly represent urethrais only lined by unremarkable keratinised squamous cell epithelium and cannot be confirmed as urethra). 
B.  Eight lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Ten lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show a benign intradermal nevus.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left vulva, depth 2mm, length 17mm, width 21mm.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Eighteen (18) lymph nodes are negative.
(see above for right vulva and margins).
