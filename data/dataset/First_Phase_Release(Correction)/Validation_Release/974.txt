CLINICAL:
Endometrial Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a partially opened uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 198gin total.  The uterus measures 110 x 60 x 60mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  In the anterior endometrium there is an area of roughening measuring 18 x 17mm which appears to invade to a maximum depth of 2mm over a total wall thickness of 30mm.  In the corresponding area in the posterior uterus there is an area of roughening 15 x 8mm which appears to invade to a maximum depth of 2mm over a total wall thickness 25mm.  The myometrium contains one large fibroid 40mm in maximum length which was received bisected presumably opened in theatre.  Multiple small fibroids are identified up to 10mm.  All fibroids appear whorled and unremarkable.  Theright fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum diameter of 8mm.  Tube and surrounding adnexa appear haemorrhagic.  The right ovary measures 25 x 18 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The left ovary measures 24 x 18 x 12mm and has one cyst measuring 8mm in maximum dimension containing straw coloured fluid.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 6 to 10 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - further anterior uterus at deepest point of invasion of tumour; 13 & 14 - representative posterior uterus at maximum point of the deepest point of invasion; 15 - representative fibroid; 16 - right tube; 17 - right ovary; 18 - left tube; 19 - left ovary.  (TO: RR:  RR/mm 15.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr G Lantaff) 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.   No convincing myometrial invasion is seen.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The myometrium shows adenomyosis and leiomyomas.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  No myometrial or lymphvascular invasion.  Cervixuninvolved.
