CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer on curettings
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateraltubes plus ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 98g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The non peritonealised surface of the uterus is inked black.  The ectocervix measures 37 x36mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is a pale endometrial tumour measuring 18 x 16mm by 8mm thick.  It invades deeply into the myometrium of the posterior wall.  The right fallopian tube measures 68mm in length and up to 8mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 13 x10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 65mm in length and 8mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 40 x 15 x 14mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix,(3 and 4 are paired); 5 and 6 -sections of tumour block 6 reserved block; 7 to 9 -  full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 10 - right fallopian tube and ovary, 11- left fallopian tube and ovary.   (TO:  ZA;SQ/vo 15.8.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Tovias):
Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Maximum depth ofmyometrial invasion is 9mm where total myometrial thickness is 15mm.  There is some squamous differentiation and mucinous differentiation.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified. There is no cervical involvement.  Two small leiomyomasare noted in the myometrium. The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion.  Stage 1B.
