Serous ovarian cancer with invasion into rectum. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by AX/at
A.  Specimen labelled "Rectosigmoid colon + left tube + ovary", consists of a segment of rectosigmoid colon 350mm long with mesenteric fatty tissue up to 60mm in thickness and adherent left ovary (75 x 60 x 50mm). The fallopian tube is 40mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter. The left ovary has a predominantly solid cut surface ranging from pale to yellowish in colour. There are multiple thin walled cysts filled with clear fluid occupying less than 10% of the ovary.  The serosal surface of the ovary is partially smooth and partially roughened/disrupted. The roughened surface is inked blue. In continuity with this roughened area there is a tan/friable tumour, 70 x 60 x 30mm, infiltrating the mesenteric fatty tissue and possibly the muscularis propria.  The tumour is 2mm from the distal resection margin.  In continuity and distal to the ovary there is a 60 x 30 x 70mm tumour with a tan friable cut surface infiltrating the mesenteric fatty tissue and possibly the muscularis externa and is 2mm from the distal resection margin.  Away from the ovary there is a 30 x 28 x 22mm indurated nodule within the mesenteric fat 50mm from the proximal resection margin.  There isa ? rectal mucosal ulcer 35 x 30mm, 30mm from the distal resection margin .  There is an indurated nodule 15mm in maximum dimension at the fimbrial end. Also there is a 30 x 20 x12mm indurated nodule floating separately within the specimen jar.
Block 1 - fimbrial end of the fallopian tube and the associated nodule; 2 - sections of the fallopian tube; 3-6 - representative sections of the ovary; 7 - representative section of ovary and adherent mesenteric fat; 8 - representative section of ovary, reserved block for tumour bank; 9 - representative section of ovary showing cystic and solid areas; 10 - representative section,separately floating nodule; 11 & 12 - representative LS, distal resection margin and tumour; 13-15 - representative sections of the ? ulcerated rectal mucosa and adjacent tumour; 16 - section of tumour at the circumferential resection margin; 17 - representative LS proximal resection margin; 18 - representative section, indurated nodule 50mm from proximal resection margin; 19 - two likely mesenteric lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic side wall mass", consists of a solid mass 31 x 15 x 14mm.  It has a tan indurated cut surface.  Block 1- two representative sections.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left paracolic gutter nodules", consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 40 x 16mm in aggregate. There are two indurated nodules 25 and 20mm in maximum dimension.  Blocks 1 & 2- each one representative section.
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omental fatty tissue 220 x 100 x 70mm.  Approximately 60% of the specimen is replaced by matted indurated nodules over a length of 220mm.  Block 1- representativesection.(WP/ec 11.6.62)
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Brandow)
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the left ovary, the fimbrial end of the left tube, the mesenteric fat and outer muscularis propria of the rectosigmoid, the lymphatics of the rectosigmoid wall and several foci of rectosigmoid mucosa.
Two mesenteric lymph nodes are free of tumour.  The surgical resection margins are also free.
The left fimbriae show carcinoma in situ.
B, C & D.  Sections show serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of the left ovary also involving the left fimbriae, mesenteric fat, rectosigmoid mucosa, rectosigmoid muscularis propria and lymphatics, right pelvic side wall, left paracolic gutter and omentum.
