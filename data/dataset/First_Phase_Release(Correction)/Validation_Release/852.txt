CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometroid adenoca.   Uterus tubes and ovaries.  Left pelvic nodes.  Uterus tubes and ovaries.  Left pelvic nodes, right pelvic nodes.  Omental biopsy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 72g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 58 x 42mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 32 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in thickness in most areas.  There is a polypoid fragile soft tumour in the left antrosuperior aspect measuring 30 x 22 x 10mm.  Sectioning through the tumour shows that the tumour is invading the underlying myometrium to a depth of 6mm in a 12mm myometrium.  The endocervix appears unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter showing a 6mm paratubal cyst.  The right ovary measures 25 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkablesurface.  The left fallopian tube measures 58mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter showing no unusual features.   The left ovary measures 20 x 12 x 9mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to4 - one full LS of body and cervix anterior; 5 & 6 - deepest invasion of tumour; 7 to 10 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 - left cornu closest to tumour; 12 - right parametrial; 13 - left parametrial; 14 - right adnexal; 15 - left adnexal; 16 - reserve block for tissue banking. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic nodes" consists of several pieces of fatty tissue together measuring 65 x 50 x 15mm containingseveral lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes are submitted.
Blocks: 1 - two nodes; 2 - one node; 3 - one node bisected.
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic node" consists of two piece of adipose tissue measuring 20mm and 50mm in greatest dimension containing several nodes ranging from 5to 25mm.  Lymph nodes are submitted.
Blocks: 1 - four nodes; 2 - one node bisected; 3 - one node. 
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a small portion of omentum 75 x 65 x 9mm showing no unusual features macroscopically.  Three representative blocks.  
(IQ/ta 12/10/62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr P Parnell):
A.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 7mm through a wall 15m thick.  Nodefinite lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix appear unremarkable and uninvolved.
Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, maximum depth of invasion 7mm through a wall 15mm thick.  Cervix uninvolved.  The omentum and ten lymph nodes are negative.
