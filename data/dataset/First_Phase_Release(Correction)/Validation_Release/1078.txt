CLINICAL:
78yr old women with serous ovarian cancer.  Received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and cervix" consists of a  uterus previously opened with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa weighing in total 82.4g.  The uterus measures 50 x 30 x 20mm.  The uterine serosa is covered by a white plaque like material.  The endometrium is 1mm in thickness and the myometrium is 15mm in thickness.   On sectioning the myometrium is unremarkable.  
The right fallopian tube measures 70 x 10 x 10mm and is covered by smooth white friable nodules measuring up to 2mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 10 x 10mm and is covered by a white plaque like material.  The cut surface is white and solid and friable.  The left fallopian tube measures 60 x 7 x 7mm.  The external surface is covered by white fibrinous material.  The left ovary measures 30 x 15 x 10mm.  The external surface is ragged.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - one full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - one full longitudinal section posterior body and cervix; 7 to 9 - right ovary AE; 10 - right fimbria; 11 - threeTS of right fallopian tube with broad ligament; 12 - one representative section of plaque like material covering the right fallopian tube and the ovary; 13 & 14 - left ovary; 15 - two LS left fimbria; 16 - three TS left fallopian tube; 17 - one TS left fallopian tube; 18 - two representative sections of plaque like material covering the left fallopian tube and the left ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic tumour" consists of a nodular piece of tissue 30 x 15 x 15mm and multiple piece of membranous tissue measuring in aggregate 30 x 20 x 10mm.On sectioning the nodule has a yellow and fatty appearance. 
Blocks: 1 - membranous tissue; 2 & 3 - nodule.
C.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix measuring 50 x 5 x 5mm.  The distal appendix looks narrow and measures 2mm in maximum diameter.  Proximal appendixis covered by white fibrinous material.  
Blocks:  1 - two LS proximal appendix; 2 - two TS mid appendix; 3 - two TS distal appendix.
D.  Specimen labelled "Ileum bowel" consists of a segment of ileum, unorientated measuring 130 x 20 x 25mm with a piece of omentum 120 x 30mm.  The external surface is covered by white fibrinous material.  Resection margins are inked black and red.  The mucosal surface is unremarkable.  A surgical defect with a blue suture isidentified close to one of the resection margins and measures 35mm in length.  No lymph nodes are identified. 
Blocks: 1 - proximal and distal resection margin; 2 & 3 - representative sections from the ileum.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Suprapubic port side" consists of an unorientated piece of fatty tissue with an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 80mm from the skin to the deep margins, 100mm from one tip to the other with a maximum thickness of 30mm.  The superficial margin is covered by skin, the deep margin is covered by thick peritoneum and muscle.  The specimen is inked blue one margin and red the opposite.  On sectioning there is a ill defined white and gritty area with small nodules.  This area measures 20x 15 x15mm and is located 15mm from the closest surgical margin.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - one full transverse section of the specimen with lesions.
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left port site" consists of a piece of fat tissue with an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 50 x 45 x 20mm.  On the surface of the skin there is a linear old scar measuring 7mm in length.  On sectioning an area of scar is identified. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - one full TS from skin to deep margin.
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of two pieces of omentum 170 x 70 x 10mm and 150 x 40 x 10mm.  Multiple tumour deposits are identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections of the tumour with omentum; 4 - tissue selected for tissue bank.   (GQ/ta 30/8/62) 
  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Gasaway):
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the surface of both ovaries and tubes, the paradnexal soft tissues, the left fimbriae and the uterine serosa. 
The ectocervix and endocervix appear unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  Numerous psammoma bodies are present.  Some bowel muscularis propria is admixed.
C.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the serosa of the appendix.
D.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the bowel serosa including one margin.
E.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the deep dermis and subcutis.
F.  Sections show serous carcinoma involving the subcutis.
G.  Sections show extensive moderatelydifferentiated serous carcinoma.  Numerous psammoma bodies are present.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, port sites, bowel serosa, appendiceal serosa, uterine serosa, surface of both ovaries and tubes, paradnexal soft tissues and left fimbriae.
