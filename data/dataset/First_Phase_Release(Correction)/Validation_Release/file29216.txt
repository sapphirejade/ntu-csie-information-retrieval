Facility_id: 016
Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
1.  Right breast 22mm lesion 10 o&amp;apos;clock 3cm FN.  Specimen marked short suture superior, long suture lateral and medium suture medial margin.
2.  Sentinel node.  Both biobank please.  Parkinson&amp;apos;s, OA.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right axilla sentinel node 1&amp;quot;, consists of a 58 x 30 x 9mm unorientated fibrofatty tissue.  Five possible lymph nodes identified, 3 to 28mm.
Blocks: 1 - three ?lymph nodes; 2 &amp;amp;  3 - one lymph node quadrisected; 4 &amp;amp; 5 - one lymph node in six sections.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right breast wire local excision, short stitch superior, long lateral, medium medial&amp;quot;, consists of a 29g oriented wide local excision with three sutures denoting superior, medial and lateral, 45mm (medial to lateral) x 39mm (superior to inferior) x 27mm (superficial to deep).  The deep margin is inked black, the superior superficial margin inked blue and the inferior superficial margin inked red.  Eleven sagittal slices from medial to lateral show a 18 x 16 x 14mm firm pale lesion in slices five to eight.  The lesion is 3mm from the superficial margin, 4mm from the superior and inferior margins and 6mm from the deep margin and well clear of the medial and lateral ends.
Blocks: 1 - slice one (medial end) en face; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - slice two (bisected); 4 to 17 - slices four to ten (each bisected in sequence); 18 - two LS of slice eleven (lateral end).   (TO:SW/ta 21/7/68)


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Scrape)
A.  Sections show an 11mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of four lymph nodes (1/4). There is focal extranodal extension up to 1.1mm. Carcinoma is transected by diathermied margin over an 8mm front.

B.  Sections of the right breast tumour show an 18mm invasive carcinoma, NST, on a background of extensive intermediate grade DCIS. A synoptic report for invasive carcinoma follows:
