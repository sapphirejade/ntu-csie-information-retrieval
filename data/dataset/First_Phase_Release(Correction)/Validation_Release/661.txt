MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior margin" consists of one piece of pink, soft tissue measuring 9 x 4 x 2mm.  AE for frozen section.
B  Specimen labelled "Inferior margin" consists of one piece of pink, soft tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1mm.  AE for frozen section.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy.
Result to surgical registrar by Dr D Maxcy & Dr D Darden at 1300 onthe 20th of January 2014.
C.  Specimen labelled "Tissue right tonsillar fossa superior short stitch, anterior long stitch" consists of a piece of tissue with short stitch marking superior and long stitch marking anterior.Specimen measures 45mm from superior to inferior, 28mm from anterior to posterior up to 18mm from superficial to deep.  Anterior blue, posterior black.  On the mucosal surface an area of ulceration is noted measuring 25 x 10mm.  Specimen sectioned from superior to inferior into ten slices.  Slice one superior.  Slice ten inferior.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - LS of superior margin; 3 to 10 - consecutive TS through the mid portion from superior to inferior; 11 & 12 of inferior margin.  AE 12 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Gertner):
A & B.  Paraffin sections confirm no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections of squamous mucosa and tonsillar tissue show ulcerated moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising on a background of carcinoma in situ.  No perineural or lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Carcinoma invades to a depth of 2mm coming to within 8mm of the deep resection margin.  A focus of invasivecarcinoma is present at the diathermied anterior resection margin.  The posterior margin is 5mm clear and both the superior and inferior margins are well clear of invasive tumour.  Adjacent carcinoma in situ focally extends to the posterior margin and is 2mm clear of the inferior margin.  The superior margin is well clear.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Anterior margin:  No evidence of malignancy.
B.  Inferior margin:  No evidence of malignancy.
C.  Right tonsillar fossa:  
- Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, positive anterior margin
- Carcinoma in situ, positive posterior margin
