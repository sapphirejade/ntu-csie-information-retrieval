Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
73 yo with left adnexal complex mass and raised Ca125.  Previous hysterectomy and RSO at age 27 for benign reasons but right tube and ovary still present and removed during procedure.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of an adnexal mass 180 x 140 x 90mm with an intact smooth serosal surface.  There appears to be an attached fallopian tube.  The cut surface is solid and cystic.90% of the wall is covered with papillary excrescences and/or solid nodules. Two representative sections (solid areas for FS).
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen sections; 3 -?fimbrial end of the fallopian tube; 4 to 18 - representative sections (18 - reserved block).  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Borderline serous tumour; no invasion seen.  
Phone result to Dr Rodney (anaesthetist) by Dr V Fiorillo/V Eaglen at 10.20 on 16.07.13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube plus ovary" consists of a 40 x 25 x 25mm ovary with attached distal third fallopian tube, 20mm in length and approximately 12mm in diameter.  There is a unilocular cyst 12mm in maximum dimension within the ovary.  The lining of the cyst is smooth.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative ovary; 3- one section of the fimbrial end.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental fatty tissue 405 x 140 x 14mm.  Specimen is sliced.  No nodules are seen.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - random sections.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Caecal cyst" consists of two pieces of mucoid material 12 x 6 x 4 and 6 x 5 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of two fragments of fatty tissue 48 x 40 x 10mm in aggregate.  There are several lymph nodes the largest 20mm in maximum dimension.  
Blocks:  1- lymph nodes as seen; 2- one lymph node bisected; 3- one lymph node bisected.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall nodule" consists of a pale/haemorrhagic nodular piece of tissue 12 x 12 x 6mm.  The nodule is sliced, it has a gritty cut surface.  It is coveredby membranous tissue on the outer surfaces.  AE 1 block.
(YH/mm 19.9.63)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr V Last):
A.  Sections show a borderline serous tumour with moderate atypical epithelial proliferation.  Focal surface non-invasive 'autoimplants' are noted with adherent adipose tissue.  No stromal invasion is seen.  The fimbrial end of the tube is present.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show benign cystic Walthards rests.  The ovary and tube show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show a benign mesothelial cyst.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show a hyalinised calficified deposit which may represent old fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Borderline serous tumour of the left ovary.
