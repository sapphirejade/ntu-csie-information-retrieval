CLINICAL:
BRAC +ve.BRCA 2 carrier, risk-reducing procedure however serous carcinoma on frozen section.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary" received fresh, consists of a fallopian tube, 90mm in length and 20mm in diameter with attached ovary 18 x 12 x 8mm.  The cut surface of the fallopian tube is tan and friable.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - frozen sections; 4 - all of the fimbrial end including adherent ovarian tissue; 5 &6 - representative of fallopian tube (6 - reserved block for tumour bank); 7 & 8 - remainder of the ovary.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with serous adenocarcinoma of fallopian tube.Ovary shows no significant abnormality.  
Phone report to Dr H Conti by Dr H Salameh/H Twardy at 9.30 on 12.09.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of a fallopian tube, 39mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter with attached soft tissue, 25 x 15 x 9mm.  Ovarian tissue is not identified.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - all of the fallopian tube; 3 & 4 - the attached soft tissue.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic side wall peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan solid tissue, 24 x 7 x 4mm.  Serially sliced AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan tissue, 15 x 7 x 7mm.  Serially sliced AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of tan/yellow solid tissue, 12 x 6 x 4mm.  Serially sliced AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas" consists of a piece of tan/yellow solid tissue, 14 x 13 x 3mm.  Serially sliced AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 28 x 15 x 8mm.  No lymph nodeis identified.  Specimen is sliced AE 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 50 x 30 x 8mm.  There appears to be a lymph node, 30mm in maximum dimension.  Most of the cut surface of the lymph node is replaced with adipose tissue.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - all of the likely lymph node.
I.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 85 x 28 x 20mm.  There are up to two lymph nodes, 10 and 26mm in maximum dimension.  The cut surface of the lymph nodes is mostly replaced with fatty tissue.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - larger lymph node; 3 - ?lymph nodes.  
J.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 65 x 55 x 20mm.  Specimen is serially sliced.  No nodules are seen.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.  (VO/mm 15.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr H Notley) 
A.  Sections show a poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube.  The tumour involves the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis of the tube and abuts the serosa.  The fimbrial end is uninvolved.  The ovary is uninvolved.
B.  Sections show an unremarkable tube and a tiny amount of atrophic ovarian stroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C, D, E, F & J.  Sections show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
H.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma confined to the right fallopian tube.  
The right ovary, left tube and ovary, peritoneal biopsies, four lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
