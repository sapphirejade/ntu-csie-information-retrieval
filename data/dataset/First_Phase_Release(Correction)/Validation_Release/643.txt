CLINICAL:
Gleason 3 + 3 prostate Ca.  Stitch loop anterior.  Long - base, short - apex.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate stitch loop anterior, short apex" consists of a total prostatectomy without vas deferens or seminal vesicles, measuring 40mm (superior to inferior) x 30mm (medial to lateral) x 30mm (anterior to posterior).  Three sutures for orientation are identified, loop - anterior, long stitch - base, short stitch - apex.  The right lateral margin is inked red, the left lateral margin inked green, anterior margin inked blue and posterior margin black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base into six slices.  Slice one apex, slice six base.  The cut surface is solid tan/yellow with tiny cystic spaces.  Specimen AE according to the attached diagram.  
Blocks: 1 to 8 - apex from right to left; 9 - slice two; 10 - slice three; 11 - slice four; 12 - slice five; 13 to 21 - base from right to left.
B.  Specimen labelled "Seminalvesicles" consists of multiple pieces of fragmented seminal vesicles measuring in aggregate 40 x 30 x 10mm.AE 8 blocks.
(EC/ta  27/8/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Trevisan):
A.  Sections show a single tumour nodule occupying the right apex and right body (see diagram). This tumour deposit is an adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3 + 4=7 (95% pattern 3, 5% pattern 4).  The surgical margins appear clear of the tumour with the closest margins being at the apex (right and inferior apical) 0.1mm, and at the right lateral body 0.1mm.  Foci of perineural invasion are seen within the tumour and at the advancing edge. 
B.  Sections of the seminal vesicles show no abnormality.  (ec)
