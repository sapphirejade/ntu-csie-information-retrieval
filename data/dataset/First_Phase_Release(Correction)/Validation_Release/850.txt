CLINICAL:
Obstructing distal transverse colon tumour.  Open subtotal colectomy.   On haemodialysis.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Patient details checked by XU
Specimen labelled "Subtotalcolectomy" consists of a distal ileum measuring 30mm in length 18mm in diameter, caecum, right colon and transverse colon, together measuring 640mm in length and 30mm in diameter at distal margin and up to 55mm in diameter at caecum.Omentum is present 310 x 200 x up to 10mm and appendix is identified 35 x 6mm.  The specimen has been partly opened on the right colon to a length of 160mm.  260mm from distal resection margin the serosa shows puckering over an underlying tumour.  Sectioning shows a circumferential tumour within the transverse colon which lies 250mm from distal resection margin.  The tumour measures 45mm in length and up to 20mm in thickness.  Part of the tumour has a polypoid appearance comprising 20% of the tumour.  The tumour shows full thickness involvement of the intestinal wall and seems to penetrate the omentum.  There are also multiple polyps proximal and distal to tumour ranging in size between 3mm and 10mm.  The colonic mucosa appears brownish (?melanosis colli).  The mucosal folds are preserved throughout colon but there is focal erythematous areas in right colon (blocks 11 and 12 ?erosion).  The ileocaecal valve, small bowel mucosa andappendix appear unremarkable.  No other lesions are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - proximal and distal margins; 2 - ileocaecal valve; 3 - appendix; 4 - tumour with closest antimesenteric involvement; 5 & 6 - paired blocks deepest invasion; 7 & 8 - tumour and adjacent polyp; 9 & 10 - polyps proximal to tumour; 11 & 12 - erythematous mucosa in right colon; 13 - polyps distal to tumour; 14 - reserve blockfor tissue bank; 15 & 16 - omentum; 17 to 20 - lymph nodes around tumour; 17 - three nodes; 18 - four nodes; 19 - four nodes; 20 - apical node; 21 to 24 - lymph nodes proximal to tumour (21- six nodes; 22 - five nodes; 23 - six nodes; 24 - six nodes); 25 - involved node distal to tumour; 26 & 27 - lymph node distal to tumour (26 - five nodes; 27 - six nodes).   (KP/ta5/12/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Hodgdon):
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal transverse colon.  The tumour is almost circumferential and no residual adenoma is identified.  The carcinoma appears obstructive and has resulting in proximal dilatation. There is no evidence of ischaemic mucosal changesproximally and the mucosa of the colon shows a mild/moderate melanosis coli.  
The carcinoma has extended through the full thickness of the bowel wall and shows prominent infiltration of the transverse mesocolon. The tumour also shows involvement of the peritoneum where small glands are seen on the surface of the mesothelium and this peritoneal surface (antimesenteric) appears mildly inflamed.
A total of forty-four (44) lymph nodes are identified (nine lymph nodes adjacent to the tumour, twenty-three proximal nodes and twelve distal nodes).  A single node immediately distal to the tumour is largely replaced by metastatic adenocarcinoma with mild perinodalspread.  No other lymph nodes are involved.  
The resection includes a total of nine (9) tubular adenomas both proximal and distal to the carcinoma and there is no evidence of metastatic spread tothe attached omentum.  The distal ileum and appendix show no abnormality.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Staining normal.
PMS2		Staining normal.
MSH2		Staining normal.
MSH6		Staining normal. 
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instabilityphenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood ofmicrosatellite instability phenotype.
