HISTORY:  
Hep B.  Liver lesion.  Segment 7 & 6.
MACROSCOPIC:  
"SEGMENT 6/7 LIVER RESECTION".  A portion of liver weighing 102g and measuring 80x60x40mm.  On the capsular surface there is a pale irregular lesion which has been previously incised measuring 35mm in diameter.  On sectioning the lesion is solid with some focal haemorrhage and ?necrosis.  The cross sectional area is up to 28x17mm.  It is located 13mm from the nearest resection margin.  
(1&2 paired full face tumour; 3 tumour with nearest resection margin; 4&5 paired full face tumour; 6 representative uninvolved liver parenchyma; 7 tumour reserve block).  RS (M-7/FF/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (P. Devillez)
Sections show a 35mm moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with trabecular and acinar architecture.  Areas of pleomorphic tumour cells including multinucleated forms are present.  Lymphovascular invasion by the carcinoma is present in adjacent liver parenchyma.  Focal intracytoplasmic bile production by the carcinoma is present.  Local excision of the carcinoma appears complete.
Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows positive staining with Cam5.2  and bile canalicular staining pattern with CD10.  Focal non specific staining with synaptophysin is seen.  No staining for CK20, AE1/AE3, ubiquitin or chromogranin is present.
The adjacent liver parenchyma shows a mild chroic hepatitis B.  There is increased fibrosis including areas of porto-portal bridging fibrosis (F2).  There is mild focal piecemeal necrosis within the portal tracts.  Minimal chronic inflammation is seen in the liver lobules.  Large cell dysplasia of hepatocytes is present and mild macrovesicular steatosis is also seen.  Hepatocyte iron and copper content is not increased.  Immunoperoxidase staining of hepatocytes shows cell membrane and cytoplasmic staining with HBsAg and focal intranuclear staining with HBcAg.  

DIAGNOSIS:  
SEGMENT 6/7 LIVER RESECTION:
- MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA ARISING ON BACKGROUND OF MILD CHRONIC HEPATITIS B.  
- LOCAL EXCISION APPEARS COMPLETE.
