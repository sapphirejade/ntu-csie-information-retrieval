DR VIRGILIO Blake FRANSISCO
Distribution:   FILE-COPY, DR Masin
CLINICAL:
Intraoperative laparotomy for bowel obstruction.  Sigmoid tumour.  ?omental mets.  Proximal obstructing sigmoid cancer requiring laparotomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Omental nodules for frozen section" consists of omental fat measuring 200 x 130 x 10mm containing a few small firm cream stellate nodules up to 10mm across.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - frozen section de-blocked; 3 & 4 - nodules; 5 - representative fat.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma.
Phoned result to Dr Adnyamathanha (surgical registrar) by Dr H Tumey art 11:10 on 27/1/14.
B.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid cancer" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 140mm in length x 30 x 25mm in maximum dimension.  The entire specimen is above the peritoneal reflection.  The serosal surface is haemorrhagic but unremarkable.  The wall thickness is 4mm.  There are two stapled margins, one is inked blue and the other is inked black.  On opening there is a circumferential tumour which obstructs the lumen of the bowel measuring approximately 30 x 20 x 10mm.  Around this area the bowel appears strictured with adhesive mesocolon to the serosal surface.  The tumour is 10mm from the black surgical margin and is 100mm from the blue surgical margin.  The rest of the bowel appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 - black surgical margin; 2 - blue surgical margin; 3 to 8 - tumour including deepest invasion through adherent mesocolon; 9 to 12 - ?lymph nodes.
(RE/bl 30/3/64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Forguson):
A.  Sections show omental tissue with foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The tumour is moderately differentiated.

Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT4a	Tumour penetrates the surface of the visceral peritoneum
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not applicable
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  Not applicable
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  12
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (extramural)
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pM1	Distant metastasis confirmed	                 Site:  Omentum (specimen A)
Background abnormalities/other comments
Metastatic tumour deposits are present in the specimen A.  This is classified as M1.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Not applicable
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block B8)
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The block best for molecular genetic testing is:B8
