CLINICAL:
Recurrent intra-abdominal dediff. liposarcoma.  Invading abdominal wall - right iliac fossa.  Separate retro gastric mass.  
NOTE:  Orientation double checked with Dr Horacio GLYNN on the 28/1/14 at 12:17pm.
The long suture should be labelled "superior or 12 o'clock".    

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled"Intra abdominal sarcoma, marking stitch: long- 6 o'clock, short- deep inferiormargin, double stitch- iliac crest" consists of an orientated ellipse of skin measuring 140 x 30mm through to the peritonealised surface of muscle which is 70mm deep.  The surface of the skin has a linear scar measuring 85mm and otherwise looks unremarkable.  There are three sutures (short - deep  inferior margin, double - iliac crest, long - superior or 12 o'clock).  The muscle measures 100 x 60 x 50mm and the serosal surface of the muscle is dull with nodular soft tan outgrowths.  The specimen is inked as follows: iliac crest - red, deep inferior - green, 3 o'clock - blue (medial), 9 o'clock - black (lateral).  On sectioning there is a variegated tan to opaque yellow tumour within the muscle.  The tumour measures 40 x 30 x 25mm and the margins are as follows:  abuts the iliac crest, and inferior - deep (6 o'clock) margin, 10mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 10mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 50mm from the 12 o'clock margin and abutting the inferior or 6 o'clock margin.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - 6 o'clock margin; 3 & 4 - 12 o'clock margin; 5 & 6 - (paired blocks) representative skin to subcutaneous fat; 7 - tumour and closest iliac crest and deep margin; 8 & 9 - adjacent blocks; 10 to 13 - (paired blocks) tumour and 3, 9, iliac crest and deep margins; 14 - closest 9 o'clock margin.    
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right peritoneal mass" consists of an encapsulated smooth solid pale yellow mass measuring 130 x 100 x 45mm.  There is a ragged area at one end which has one suture attached (nor orientated on form or specimen label).  The specimen is inked black.  Onsectioning the cut surface shows a homogenous pale yellow cut surface with ill defined lobules.  There are no areas of haemorrhage or necrosis.  Representative in 12 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel nodule" consists of a nodule of fibrofatty tissue measuring 25 x 20 x 15mm.  The outer surface is smooth lined and there is a ragged area (surgical defect).  The surgical defect inked black.  On sectioning the nodule is composed of lobules of pale yellow fatty tissue.  No areas of necrosis or haemorrhage are identified.   Specimen is serially sectioned and AE 3 blocks.  
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Deep iliac crest margin" consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 5, 7 and 15mm in maximum dimension.  AE 2blocks.
Blocks: 1 - largest fragment; 2 - smallest fragment.   (OZ/ta 30/3/64) 
 

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Ahlborn):
A.  Sections show a high grade sarcoma with mixed appearances.  Part of tumour (less than 5%) shows well differentiated liposarcoma.  The rest of tumour (more than 95%) shows undifferentiated high grade sarcoma.  There is abrupt transition between well differentiated liposarcoma and high grade non-lipogenic area.  Within the undifferentiated high grade component, there are large areas of necrosis.  Frequent mitoses, marked nuclear pleomorphism and invasion of skeletal muscle are seen.  No obvious heterologous elements are seen.  The appearances are consistent with those of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  The tumour is incompletely excised.  The tumour focally involves the 9 o'clock margin (block A11).  The tumour is less than 0.5mm to the iliac crest/deep margin (block A7) and is less than 1mm to the 6 o'clock margin (block A2).
B.  Sections show a well differentiated liposarcoma (adipocytic type).  The tumour is incompletely excised.  The tumour extends to the resection margin over a broad area.  
C.  Sections show a well differentiated liposarcoma (adipocytic type).  The tumour is incompletely excised.  The tumour extends to the resection margin over a broad area.  
D.  Sections show an undifferentiated high grade sarcoma invading skeletal muscle.  There is marked crushing artefact.  The deep iliac crest margin is involved.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Intra abdominal sarcoma - Dedifferentiated liposarcoma.
B.  Right peritoneal mass - Well differentiated liposarcoma.
C.  Small bowel nodule - Well differentiated liposarcoma.
D.  Deep iliac crest margin - Dedifferentiated liposarcoma.
