Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Excision of abdominal wall desmoid tumour from lower anterior abdominal wall. Includes whole of left rectus and partial right rectusmuscles.  
Marking sutures:
Short superior.
Long lateral.
Loop deep.
Further right lateral margin excised as separate specimen.  
Previous surgery in 2062.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Desmoid tumour stitch short superior, long lateral, loop deep" consists of a specimen of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue with three marking stitches as described on the label, 95mm (lateral to medial) x 75mm (superior to inferior) x 35mm (superficial to deep).  The deep aspect of the left rectus muscle is covered by peritoneum over a surface of 63 x 55mm.  The surgical margin is inked in three colours, superior red, superficial blue and deep black.  The specimen is sliced fromleft to right into 14 slices.  There is a pale tumour with a rubbery consistency within the left rectus muscle, appearing to extend into the right rectus muscle, 55 x 37 x 18mm.  The tumour is 9mm from the left, 25mm from right, 3mm from superior, 4mm from inferior, 6mm from superficial and 1mm from deep margins.  
Blocks:  1 - representative section slice 1 (left margin); 2 - representativeslice 2 (deep and superficial); 3 - slice 3 (deep margin, reserved block for tumour banking); 4 -slice 4 (deep and superficial); 5 - slice 4 (inferior margin); 6 - deep margin slice 5; 7 - superior margin slice 5; 8 - superior margin slice 7; 9 - superficial margin slice 7; 10 - superficial and deep margins slice 8; 11 - inferior margin slice 9; 12 - superficial and deep margins slice 9; 13 - inferior margin slice 10; 14 - representative sections slice 14 (right lateral).  Please see diagram.  Blocks 1 to 12 - left rectus muscle; 13 & 14 - right rectus.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral margin" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, unoriented, 26 x 15 x 10mm.  The margin is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sliced.  The cut surface is predominantly yellow andglistening.  There are intervening pale streaks within the fatty tissue.  No tumour is seen.  AE 2 blocks.  (EO/mm 14.6.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Petretti):   
A. The sections show a desmoid tumour invading skeletal muscle and fibrofatty tissue.  Immunoperoxidase stains show expression of betacatenin antigen in the tumour cells.  It reaches the deep margin in scattered foci (e.g., blocks A5, A6), focally reaches the superficial margin (block A9), superior margin (blockA7) and inferior margin (A11). It is more than 5mm from the other margins.  Patchy chronic inflammation and many groups of macrophages (CD68 positive, Cam 5.2 negative) are seen.  
B. The sections show fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle.  There is no evidence of malignancy (confirmed with beta catenin immunoperoxidase stains).
COMMENT
The slides were also shown to Dr LOU ARENSTAM and demonstrated at the Sarcoma meeting.
CONCLUSION
A. Desmoid tumour reaching superior, inferior, superficial and deep margins.
B. Right lateral margin: No evidence of malignancy.
