CLINICAL:
Large transverse colon tumour with omental and nodal mets.  Extended right hemicolectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a hemicolectomy measuring 200mm in length from caecum to distal margin, with 40mm of terminal Ileum.  No appendix is attached.  A nodular tumour measuring 120 x 55 x 75 is present 50mm from the distal surgical margin. It is circumferential and extends through the wall on the antimesenteric aspect however macroscopically does not appear to breech the serosa.  There are tumour deposits and fat wrapping in the surrounding mesentery.  Multiple polyps measuring 2mm-6mm are present in the ascending colon.
Blocks:  1 - LS proximal margin; 2- LS distal margin; 3 to 8 - representative tumour; 9 - polyps; 10 -reserved bock; 11 - representative proximal bowel; 12 & 13 - high point resection possible apical node; 14 - calcified apical lymph node; 15 to 18 - caecal area lymph nodes; 15 - five possible lymph nodes; 16 - three possible lymph nodes; 17 - one possible lymph node; 18 - three possible lymph nodes; 19 to 22 - tumour area lymph nodes (19 - one possible lymph node; 20 - one possible lymph node; 21 - one bisected lymph node; 22 - three possible lymph nodes.  (ZJ/mm 3.1.62)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr LJake):
Sections show moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The features are as follows:

Macroscopic Description

Maximum tumour diameter:  120mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  50mm (distal) 
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description

Type
Mucinous carcinoma
Differentiation by predominant area

Perineuralinvasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Adenomas (x2)
Hyperplastic polyp (x1)
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation ofthat mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
