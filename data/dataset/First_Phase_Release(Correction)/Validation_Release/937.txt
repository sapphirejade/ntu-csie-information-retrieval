CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 105g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 20 x 20mm and has a partly congested appearance. Arising within the endometrial cavity there is a fungating tan tumour measuring 40 x 30 x 10mm (anteriorly) and 20 x 12 x 10mm (posteriorly).  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximal thickness while the myometrium is 40mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains a single 35mm fibroid.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, 5mm in external diameter.  The right ovary measures 17 x 12 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, 5mm in externaldiameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections in 23 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - further sections anterior body; 7 - fibroid;8 - research block; 9 to 12 - full LS posterior body; 13 - further section posterior body; 14 to 17 - right fallopian tube all embedded; 18 - right ovary bisected all embedded; 19 to 22 - left fallopian tube all embedded; 23 -left ovary BAE.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 25 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 3 to 20mm across.  Lymph nodes all embedded in 3 blocks. 
Blocks:  1- one lymph node; 2- three lymph nodes; 3 - two lymph nodes.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists oftwo irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 5mm and 30 x 10 x 4mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 10mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1- two lymph nodes; 2- two lymph nodes. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 7 to 20mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1- two lymph nodes; 2- one lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of an irregularpiece of fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 5 to 10mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks.
Blocks:  1- three lymph nodes; 2 - two lymph nodes.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 30 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 4 to 17mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks. 
Blocks:  1 & 2- two lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - largest lymph node divided into four.  
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 40 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 4 to 25mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 5 blocks.  
Blocks:1 & 2 - two lymph nodes in each; 3 - one lymph node bisected; 4 & 5 - one lymph node bisected.  (TO: FP; FP/mm 25.3.63)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr V Rothgeb) 
A.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 8mm through a wall10mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
The myometrium contains a benign leiomyoma.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Four lymph nodesshow no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 8mm through a wall 10mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.  Twenty five (25) negative lymph nodes.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 16/1/63:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 allshow preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
