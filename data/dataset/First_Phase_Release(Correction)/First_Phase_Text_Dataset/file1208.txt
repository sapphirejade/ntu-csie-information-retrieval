djustrightHISTORY:
TV colon/small bowel.  Omentum .
MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OME NTUM, COLON, SMALL BOWEL, PERITONEAL DISEASE, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;.
Peritoneum - a strip of peritoneum measuring in aggregate 50x50x50mm. There are multiple firm nodules of tumour deposit on the surface, the largest measuring 12mm in ma ximal extent.
(1&amp;amp;2 RS)
Diaphragm - Multiple fragments of diaphragm, measuring in aggregate 40x40x40mm. The surface shows some pale firm areas ? tumour ? fibrosis. These have been sampled.
(3-5 RS)par
Segment of bowel with adherent omentum - A segment of bowel measuring 90mm in length and 30mm in diameter with adherent omentum measuring up to 260x150x50mm.  On opening the bowel, one resection margin appears to be small bowel , the opposing resection margin appears to be large bowel.  Margins inked blue and black respectively.  A well healed anastomosis is noted 35mm from the blue inked resection margin.  On sectioning the omentum is adherent at the area of an astomosis with some pale firm area ? tumour present.
(6&amp;amp;7 representative LS resection margins of bowel; 8 representative mucosa with adjacent tumour; 9&amp;amp;10 representative omentum and serosal tumour deposits; 11 tumour reserve  block).  RS (M-11/EE/ank)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr Y Baughey)
Sections show numerous  metastatic deposits of poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma in keeping with origin from colorectal primary involving peritoneal fragments, diaphragm including involvement of skeletal muscle, mesentery of sid6317412 ileocolonic anastomosis and omentum. The small bowel and colonic wall are free of tumour.
The surgical margi ns of resection of the small bowel and colon appear clear of tumour.
DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM, COLON, SMALL BOWEL, PE RITONEAL DISEASE AND RIGHT DIAPHRAGM :
-METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA IN KEEPING WITH ORIGIN FROM COLORECTAL PRIMARY.
