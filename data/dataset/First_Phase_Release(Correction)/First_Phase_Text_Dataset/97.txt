SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (11.7.62):


CLINICAL:
Mixed endometrioid adenocarcinoma and MMMT of endometrium.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus & tubes + ovaries" consists of a uterus without cervix, with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 158g in total.  The uterus is distorted and has been opened prior to receipt.  The uterus measures 80 x 40 x 60mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  On sectioning, in the endometrial cavity there is an exophytic and fungating tumour which is arising from the anterior and right and left lateral walls.  It measures 60 x 80mm.  Cut surfaces show tumour up to 26mm thick and invading through the full thickness of the myometrium to abut the serosal surface anteriorly.  The right fallopian tube measures 90mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter and has been previously ligated.  The right ovary measures 15 x 15 x 5mm and on sectioning is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter and has been previously ligated.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 50mm and has a cyst 10mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - one longitudinal section of anterior face of uterus; 6 to 8 - three representative sections of tumour in anterior face; 9 & 10 - one longitudinal section of posterior surface of uterus; 11 & 12 - two representative sections of tumour in posterior face; 13 - right parametrial tissue; 14 - left parametrial tissue; 15 - longitudinal section of right fimbria; 16 - one transversesection right fallopian tube and one section of ovary with ovarian cyst; 17 - longitudinal section of left fimbria; 18 - one transverse section of fallopian tube and one representative section of left ovary;19 -reserve block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Cervix" consists of an amputated unorientated cervix measuring 45mm in length and up to 20mm in maximum diameter.  The ectocervical mucosa is pink and shiny with small petechial haemorrhages.  The endocervicalmucosa is unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - composite longitudinal sections from cervix; 3 & 4 - composite longitudinal section of cervix.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 80x 60 x 15mm.  No focal lesions are seen on sectioning.  Two representative sections in two blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 70 x 20 x 10mm.  Four fatty lymph nodes are identified measuring from 10 to 35mm in maximum diameter.
Blocks:  1 to 4 - one bisected lymph node each.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a fatty node measuring 15 x 10 x 7mm. 
Blocks:  1 - one bisected lymph node.  (OS/cc 3/7/62)
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Deakin): 
A.  Sections show high grade endometrial carcinoma with variable appearances.  It is partly a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with some well formed glands but also significant solid tumour and areas of squamous differentiation.  There is a second component which consists ofsheets and cords of undifferentiated cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, showing frequent mitoses and prominent necrosis; this component stains CD56 and synaptophysin positive but oestrogen receptor negative, while the endometrioid component has the opposite profile.  A chromogranin stain is negative.  This latter component is most consistent with a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.  The small cell carcinoma component shows extensive lymphovascular invasion in the deep myometrium and in subserosal tissue.  No sarcomatous (MMMT) component is identified.  Around 60% of the tumour is small cell carcinoma and 40% is grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The tumor invades through the myometrium which is 26 mm in thickness and is present on the anterior serosal surface.  
The main tumour is 4mm clear of the distal excision margin of the uterus posteriorly, and 15mm clear of the distal margin anteriorly, but there is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in subserosal vessels extending to near the anterior distal margin.  There is also multifocal lymphovascular invasion in parametrial vessels bilaterally.  
A leiomyoma and foci of adenomyosis are also noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
B.  The sections show ectocervix and endocervix.  Tumour is identified focally within disrupted tissue on the outer (adventitial) surface of the cervix focally.  No other significant abnormality is seen.
C.  Sections show normal fat.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show one lymph node. There is no evidence of malignancy. 

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Mixed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (60%) and grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (40%) of endometrium, invading to anterior serosa.  Stage 3A.
B.  Cervix:  Focal tumour in disrupted adventitial tissue.
C.  Omentum:  No tumour.
D.  Left internal Iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/4).
E.  Right external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (11.7.62):
A.  The small cell carcinoma component is negative with a TTF-1 immunostain.  This would make a metastasis from lung very unlikely. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (12.7.62):
A.  Immunostains have been performed as requested.
The tumour cells of the endometrioid component show normal positive nuclear staining for the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2.
