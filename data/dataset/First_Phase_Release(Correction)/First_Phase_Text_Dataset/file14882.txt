Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, CA 125&amp;gt;200.  Left ovarian surface nodule.  Posterior uterine adhesion.  Left ovary + tube - cystic mass associated with ovary CA 125 &amp;gt;100.  Bilateral ovarian masses, CA 125 &amp;gt;200.  Right ovarian surface biopsy.  Right ovarian cyst wall.  Right ovarian cyst.  Left tube and ovary, appendix, omentum, endometrial curettings.

Additional note:
As per Dr Breiling the left ovarian cyst was not opened intraoperatively.  The operative impression is that tumour focally involves the ovarian surface.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Posterior uterine adhesion F/S&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of brown tissue measuring 22 x 10 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Vascular loose fibrous tissue with reactive mesothelium.  NEOM.
Reported by Dr Y Mindell at 1230 on 20/09/16.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left ovarian surface nodule&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of tan tissue, 5 x 3 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Fibrous + mesothelial cells.  Benign.
Reported by Dr Y Hawkinson at 1230 on 20/09/16.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right ovarian cyst wall&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of red tissue resembling a cyst wall, 160 x 100 x 1mm.  The outer surface is smooth and shiny.  The inner lining shows papillary shape projections (approximately 10% of the surface)   Representative sections in three blocks for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - frozen section; 4 to 10 - the rest of tissue.  AE 10 blocks.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour low grade serous borderline tumour or focal proliferation.  Some areas appear mucinous.  Advised to remove appendix.
Result to Dr Landan by Dr Y Kalkwarf/Dr Y Bidle at 1400 on 20/9/16.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left ovary and tube&amp;#8221; consists of a distorted cystic structure measuring 100 x 50 x 30mm.  The internal lining is completely covered by papillary projections.  The cyst wall appears focally disrupted with papillary projections are protruding out and are visible from external surface.  The rest of the outer lining is smooth.  The attached fallopian tube is 90mm in length and 10mm in diameter and appears uninvolved. A suture is noted adjacent to fallopian tube.  A cystic cavity with adjacent haemorrhagic area noted adjacent to the fallopian tube measuring approximately 40 x 30 x 20mm ?remnants of ovary.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous borderline tumour
Result to Dr Zapf by Dr Y Pante/Dr Y Romanini at 1430 on 20/9/16.

Blocks:  1 to 3 - frozen section; 4 to 10 - more representative sections of the papillary lesion; 11 - two LS fimbria and two TS fallopian tube; 12&amp;amp;13 - representative sections of the cystic cavity adjacent to fallopian tube ?ovary.  RS in 13 blocks.

E. Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right ovarian surface biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of an irregular piece of tan tissue measuring 40 x 10 x 3mm.  AE 2 blocks.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right ovarian cyst&amp;#8221; consists of an irregular piece of tan tissue resembling a distorted cystic structure measuring 140 x 100mm with a wall thickness varying from 1 to 3mm.  The outer surface appears partially ragged and congested and partially smooth.  Approximately 30% of the inner lining shows papillary projections.
Blocks:  1 to 14 - representative sections of the cyst wall including representative papillary projections with 13&amp;amp;14 - ?remnants of ovary.  RS in 14 blocks.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Appendix&amp;#8221; consists of an appendix measuring 50mm in length and 6mm in diameter with remnants of mesoappendix attached to the tip 25mm in length and 5mm in width.  The serosa appears unremarkable.  On sectioning the appendix appears unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 - two LS tip and one TS body; 2 - four TS body; 3 - two LS base and one TS body.  AE 3 blocks.

H.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Endometrial curettings&amp;#8221; consists of multiple fragments of irregular tan tissue mixed with mucoid bloodstained material measuring 20 x 10 x 2mm.  Most of the tissue appears to be mucoid material.  AE 1 block.

I.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omentum&amp;#8221; consists of a segment of omental fat measuring 330 x 70 x 5mm.  It appears congested but is otherwise unremarkable.  No gross lesion or lymph node is identified.  Representative section in 3 blocks.  (LN/ua 23.11.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Shuckhart):
A.  Sections show benign fibrous tissue with reactive change.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections show a benign fibrous nodule.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show features of borderline serous tumour (low malignant potential).  The tumour shows prominent broad, branching papillae (hierarchical branching) covered by stratified epithelium with mild to moderate atypia with few mitoses.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
D.  Sections show features of borderline serous tumour (low malignant potential).  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
E.  Sections show hyalinised fibrous tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show features of borderline serous tumour (low malignant potential).  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
G.  Sections show normal appearing appendix with no significant abnormality.  No inflammation is seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Sections show proliferative endometrium.  There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.
I.  Sections show normal appearing omental tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Posterior uterine adhesion F/S - No evidence of malignancy.

B.  Left ovarian surface nodule - No evidence of malignancy.

C.  Right ovarian cyst wall - Borderline serous tumour.

D.  Left ovary and tube - Borderline serous tumour.
