CLINICAL:
Right middle cranial fossa lesion.  Multiple myeloma.  Likely multiple myeloma ?Plasmacytoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right middle cranial lesion" consists of a piece of soft pink tissue measuring 6 x 3 x 3mm which was unsuitable to smear.  Two thirds embedded for frozen section.  
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - remaining tissue.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Tumour, possible neoplastic, type unknown.  
Result to neurosurgical registrar by Dr B Encallado at 17.20 on 2/4/13.  (TR/ta 4/6/63) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right middle fossa lesion", received in formalin, consists of three pieces of tissue 5 to 10mm.  AE one block.   (BB/cc 5/6/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Manos):
A and B. Sections show a lesion composed of sheets of tumour cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Some of the tumour cells present have eccentric clock-faced nuclei, in keeping with plasma cell differentiation.
The tumour cells are positive for CD138. There is kappa light chain restriction on kappa/lambda staining.
The findings are in keeping with a plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma.
DIAGNOSIS:
