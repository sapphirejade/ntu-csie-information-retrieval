HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Peritonectomy. Appendix Ca.
Small bowel peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL + PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Consists of two segments of small bowel and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue. The first segment of small bowel measures 135mm in length with a maximum diameter of 20mm. The serosa is roughened and partially covered by mucinous tumour deposits. On opening, the mucosa is unremarkable. One margin is inked blue, the other black. The second segment of small bowel measures 130mm in length with a maximum diameter of 20mm. The serosa is roughened, mucosa is unremarkable. One margin is inked blue, the other black. The separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue, in aggregate measures 230x210x20mm. There are involved extensively by a mucinous tumour.

(1&amp;amp;2 first segment of small bowel [1 margins]; 3&amp;amp;4 second segment of small bowel [3 margins]; 5-8 pieces of fibrofatty tissue received separately involved by tumour [6 tumour block]). RS (M-8/MC 9/12/2067 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr U Kerle)
Sections of the segment of small bowel show normal appearing mucosa. The serosal surfaces show numerous adhesions with deposits of extracellular mucous including some strips and groups of low-grade mucinous epithelium. Similar deposits of extracellular mucous including mucinous epithelium are seen close to the surgical margins of the small bowel segment. The sections of the separate piece of fatty tissue also show large deposits of extracellular mucous including strips and glands and multilayered mucinous epithelium with low-grade cytologic features.
Comment: The appearances are those of low-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (PSOGI Consensus Classification). Clinical correlation is recommended.

DIAGNOSIS:
SMALL BOWEL AND PERITONECTOMY TISSUE
- LOW-GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI.
