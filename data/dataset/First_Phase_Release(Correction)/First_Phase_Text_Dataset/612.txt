The solid area comprises approximately 40% of the ovary and hasa cream cut surface.  The cut surface of the cystic area shows a unilocular cyst containing a 10mm tan brown mural nodule.  Also included is a separate segment of fallopian tube 45mm in length, 6mm in external diameter.  One TS through solid area and one TS through cystic area for frozen section.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section block 1A; 2 - frozen section block 2A; 3 & 4 - further representative solid area; 5 & 6 - further representative cystic area; 7 - representative fallopian tube.
