Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
SCC vulva - previous excisional biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left anterior vulva, stitch at 12 o'clock" consists of an ellipse of mucosa and hair bearing skin measuring 80 x 16mm with attached underlying fatty tissue measuring 75 x 50 x 15mm.  The skin surface appears roughened and indurated over an area 15 x 5mm.  The mucosal surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  A suture marks 12 o'clock.  The 9 o'clock margin isinked blue while the 3 o'clock margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from the 12 to 6 o'clock position into 18 consecutive slices and AE 31 blocks.  
Please see attached diagram.
Blocks:  6&7, 8&9, 10&11,12&13, 14&15, 16&17, 18&19, 20&21,22&23,24&25, 26&27, 28&29,30&31 - paired blocks.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Leftlateral inguinal lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 60 x 15 x 12mm containing two fatty lymph nodes measuring 22 and 25mm across.  AE 4 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - smaller node; 2 & 3 - larger node bisected; 4 - remaining fatty tissue.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left medial inguinal node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 75 x 30 x 25mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 3 to 30mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 4 blocks.  
Blocks:1 - four possible lymph nodes; 2 - two lymph nodes; 3 - two lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node bisected.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left femoral node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 13 x 10 x 5 and 20 x 15 x 5mmcontaining a single 10mm lymph node.  AE 2 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2 - remaining fatty tissue.  (TO: TS; PS/mm 22.1.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr D Smoke): 
A.  Sections show skin and squamousmucosa with underlying tissue.  Centrally in the specimen there is a scar which extends into underlying fat.  Suture material is present within the scar.  No residual invasive carcinoma is identified.  The surface skin and mucosa show features consistent with lichen sclerosus.  No VIN is seen.  
B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
C.  Sections show nine lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.   
D.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.  
 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left anterior vulva:  
-  Scar, no residual tumour identified. 
-  Lichen sclerous.  
B.  Left lateral inguinal lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).  
C.  Left medial inguinal nodes:  No tumour (0/9).
D.  Left femoral node:  No tumour (0/1).
