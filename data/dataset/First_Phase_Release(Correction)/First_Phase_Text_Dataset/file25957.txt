Pelvic mass TM neg.  Fibroma on frozen section.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right ovary and tube&amp;quot;, consists of a firm 120 x 95 x 60mm cream ovarian mass with a smooth serosal surface.  An attached 25 x 15 x 10mm presumed residual ovary is noted.  The fallopian tube is 40 x 5mm.  On sectioning of the ovarian mass, the cut surface is mostly solid with a small cystic component, filled with gelatinous material.  The cyst wall is smooth.  Haemorrhagic foci is scattered throughout.
Frozen section 1 - Transverse section residual ovary; 2 to 4 - RS ovarian mass.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 - frozen section three; 4 - frozen section four; 5 - fallopian tube; 6 - TS of residual ovary; 7 - residual ovary with mass; 8 to 13 - further RS of ovarian mass.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour fibroma.
Phone results to Dr Henn by Dr KRIS SYLVIAN at 16:28pm on 7/3/2017.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a 34 x 12 x 14mm ovary and 40 x 5mm fallopian tube, weighing 7g in total.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into eight slices.  the cut surface is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 - fallopian tube; 2 - two TS of ovary.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of 155 x 110 x 10mm of omental fat.  Sectioning shows homogeneous yellow fat with no discrete lesions.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - RS.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Mccay):
A. Sections show a fibroma of the ovary. The lesion is composed of anastomosing fascicles of spindle shaped tumour cells with bland, elongated nuclei. Rare mitoses and focal oedema are seen. The adjacent ovary and fallopian tube appear unremarkable. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B. Sections of the ovary and fallopian tube appear unremarkable. There is no evidence of malignancy.
C. Sections show omental fat with no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Right ovary and fallopian tube: fibroma of the ovary
B and C. Left fallopian tube and ovary, omental biopsy: no abnormality detected
