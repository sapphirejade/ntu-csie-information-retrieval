Block 1- FS1; 2 - FS2.  AE 2 blocks.

FROZEN SECTION:  A &amp;amp; B.  Reactive nodes.  No evidence of malignancy.
Result to Dr IRVIN LUO by Dr K Nolet at 2:55pm on 19.9.16.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes + ovaries&amp;#8220;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries which weighs 130g.  The uterus with attached cervix measures 90 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and appears congested but is otherwise unremarkable. The anterior resection margin is inked blue and posterior is inked black.
On sectioning, the endometrium is 8mm in maximum thickness.  There is an exophytic tumour involving the anterior and posterior walls of the body and fundus.  It measures 43 x 38 in surface dimensions.  It appears to invade the myometrium to a maximum depth of 8mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 22mm.  There is a fibroid in the myometrium, 25mm in diameter.
The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 6mm in diameter.  It includes multiple paratubal cysts but is otherwise unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 26 x 18 x 7mm and appears unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 6mm in diameter and includes multiple paratubal cysts but is otherwise unremarkable. The left ovary measures 28 x 20 x 7mm and appears unremarkable.  A small amount of fatty tissue 40 x 20 x 10mm is attached to the left ovary.
Block 1-4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5-6 - one paired section on left anterior embedded from superior to inferior with an ill defined area,? adenomyosis; 7-8 - paired section on left anterior embedded from superior to inferio; 9-10 - paired section on right anterior embedded from superior to inferior; 11 - left anterior with ill defined area; 12-15 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 16-18 - rep sections ill defined area at right posterior fundus adjacent to tumour; 19-20 - rep sections ill defined area adjacent to tumour at left posterior fundus; 22 - fibroid; 23 - right fallopian tube; 24 - right ovary; 25 - left fallopian tube; 26 - left ovary.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left parauterine cyst&amp;#8220;, consists of a circumscribed structure measuring 6 x 5 x 4mm.  There is a thin capsule with central brown material.  BAE 1 block.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left external iliac&amp;#8220;, consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x7 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right pelvic node&amp;#8220;, consists of multiple fragments of irregular fibrofatty tissue measuring 60 x 50 x 10mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified measuring 10-60mm in maximum dimension. The largest measures 60 x 15 x 10mm.  Block 1-3 - the largest lymph node; 4 - one lymph node in four pieces; 5 - one lymph node in three pieces; 6-7 - rest of fibrofatty tissue.  AE 3 blocks.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left obturator nodes&amp;#8220;, consists of multiple fragments of irregular fibrofatty tissue measuring 50 x 40 x 15mm in aggregate.  Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 35 x 15 x 15mm and 8 x 6 x 6mm.  Block 1-2 - larger lymph node; 3- smaller lymph node bisected; 4 - the rest of fibrofatty tissue. AE 4 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Strakbein):
A.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.

B.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.

C.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  It is architectural grade 2.  Some of the tumour has grade 3 nuclei but these comprise less than 50% of the tumour so overall it is regarded as grade 2.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 6mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 12mm.  There are foci of lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  There is no cervical involvement.
There is adenomyosis in the myometrium and this is at least focally involved by tumour.  A leiomyoma is also confirmed in the myometrium.
Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.

Immunohistochemical Stains:
MLH1:  Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:  Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:  Loss of nuclear staining.
MSH6:  Loss of nuclear staining.

Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI) and may reflect  the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.

D.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.

E.  Sections show fat.  No lymph node is seen.  No tumour is seen.

F.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.

G.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).

B.  Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).

C.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:
1.  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  Depth of invasion 6mm out of total myometrial thickness of 12mm.  Stage 1B.
2.  Adenomyosis and leiomyoma.

D.  Left parauterine tissue:  Lymph node with no tumour (0/1).

E.  Left external iliac:  No lymph node, no tumour.

F.  Right pelvic nodes:  No tumour (0/3).

G.  Left obturator nodes:  No tumour (0/3).


SUPPLEMENTARY/AMENDED REPORT 4.1.66):
C.  An area of atypical epithelium was identified at the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube (block C25) so a p53 stain was done.  This shows two small areas of band-like positive staining, and these correspond to areas with cytologic atypia on the H and E stained slide.  The appearances are consistent with a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC lesion).  No invasive carcinoma is seen.
Slides of the right fallopian tube and ovaries have been reviewed and no other abnormality is seen.  A p53 stain performed on the section of the fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube is negative.
