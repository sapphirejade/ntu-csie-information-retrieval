Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Stage 2A carcinoid ovarian tumour diagnosed after oophorectomy elsewhere.  Underwent laparoscopy, washings, TLH and RSO and appendicectomy today.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, right tube and ovary&amp;#8220;, consists of a uterus measuring 90 x 50 x 40mm with cervix measuring 35 x 35mm with attached tube and ovary.  Total specimen weight 124g.  The uterus measures 90 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 6mm thick and the myometrium is 16mm thick.  The myometrium contains foci of adenomyosis and a single large fibroid measuring 25 x 20 x 15mm.  The fibroid contains a focus of haemorrhage and is on the anterior wall.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 7mm in maximal diameter. The right ovary measures 30 x 15 x 10mm. The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  On the left a stump of presumed fallopian tube is present measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.  Block 1-4 - LS full thickness anterior wall; 5 &amp;amp; 6 - fibroid; 7-11 - LS full thickness posterior wall uterus; 12 - fimbrial end right fallopian tube; 13 - TS right fallopian tube; 14 &amp;amp; 15- right ovary TS AE; 15-20 - residual stump of fallopian tube on the left (all of the stump is embedded). Comment all of the right ovary is embedded.

B.   Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Appendix&amp;#8220;, consists of an appendix measuring 55mm in length with a diameter of 6mm. The surgical margin is inked black.  Attached mesoappendix measures 45 x 25 x 6mm.  The serosal surface of the appendix appears unremarkable.  The wall thickness is up to 3mm. Within the lumen is a ? faecolith.  Block 1 - shave surgical margin and LS tip; 2 - TS body;
3 - LS body.  All of the appendix is embedded.  (TO:  MS/ec  12.7.66).


MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr K Paquette)
A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is proliferative. The myometrium shows extensive adenomyosis and a leiomyoma with hyaline type necrosis.  The right ovary and fallopian tube show no atypical features. The uterine serosa and left ovarian stump show a florid foreign body type giant cell reaction, consistent with recent surgery. There is no evidence of complex hyperplasia or malignancy.

B.  The appendix has been examined in its entirety. The appendiceal lumen is expanded by a faecolith. There is no evidence of acute appendicitis. No pathogenic organisms or granulomas are identified. There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, right ovary and fallopian tube: Proliferative endometrium, adenomyosis, leiomyoma and serosal foreign body giant cell reaction. No evidence of malignancy.

B.  Appendix: Faecolith. No evidence of appendicitis or malignancy.
