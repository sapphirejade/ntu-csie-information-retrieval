Hx of vulval Ca in 2060 with recurrence in 2062.  Anterior vulvectomy with distal urethra stitch at 12 o&amp;apos;clock.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Anterior vulva with distal urethra stitch at 12 o&amp;apos;clock&amp;#8221; and consists of a vulvectomy specimen measuring 95 x 50 x 18mm.  The overlying skin measures 80 x 45mm.  There is a suture marking 12 o&amp;apos;clock which is inked green and the 6 o&amp;apos;clock edge inked black.  On the skin surface there is a tan slightly raised plaque measuring 52 x 30mm in surface dimension.  10mm from the 6 o&amp;apos;clock edge of the specimen there is a full thickness tract 3mm in diameter (?urethra).  The tumour appears to have a maximum depth of 8mm.  The tumour appears clear of the deep margin.  The tumour is 3mm from 12 o&amp;apos;clock, 2mm from 6 o&amp;apos;clock, 15mm from 9 o&amp;apos;clock and well clear of the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; 3 o&amp;apos;clock soft tissue margin en face; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;#8211; (paired sections) 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;#8211; (paired sections), (1 to 5 &amp;#8211; do not include epidermal surface); 6 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;#8211; (paired sections) 3 o&amp;apos;clock skin margin; 8 &amp;amp; 9 - (paired sections); 10 &amp;amp; 11 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 12 &amp;amp; 13 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 14 &amp;amp; 15 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 16 &amp;amp; 17 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 18 &amp;amp; 19 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 20 &amp;amp; 21 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 22 &amp;amp; 23 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 24 &amp;amp; 25 &amp;#8211; (paired sections) 23 &amp;amp; 25 include ?urethra; 26 &amp;amp; 27 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 28 &amp;amp; 29 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 30 &amp;amp; 31 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 32 to 34 &amp;#8211; one slice (34 &amp;#8211; is deep to 33); 35 &amp;amp; 36 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 37 &amp;amp; 38 &amp;#8211; (paired sections); 39 &amp;amp; 40 (paired sections); 41 &amp;#8211; 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin en face AE.  (TO: HM; HM/ta 1/12/65)
Please see the diagram.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Beitel):
Sections show an extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.   The tumour has a maximum depth of 7mm, length of 37mm, and an estimated width of 64mm.  Carcinoma extends to the 12 o&amp;#8217;clock margin (block 22) and to the 5 o&amp;#8217;clock margin (block 15).  Carcinoma is clear of the 3 o&amp;#8217;clock and
9 o&amp;#8217;clock margins by 4mm.  Carcinoma is clear of the deep margin by 2.5mm (block 30 at the 11 o&amp;#8217;clock margin) and 5mm (blocks 21 &amp;amp; 23, anterior to the urethra).  The remainder of the deep margin is well clear.  The urethra is uninvolved.
Focal perineural invasion is present.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
Adjacent lichen sclerosis is present, but there is no convincing VIN.
DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, depth 7mm, length 37mm, width 64mm.  Perineural invasion present.  SEE ABOVE RE MARGINS.
