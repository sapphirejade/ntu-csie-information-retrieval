HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:
AMENDED REPORT TO COMPLETE FINDINGS UNDER OTHER PATHOLIGIES AND
ANCILLARY STUDIES 22/2/67

HISTORY:
Distal stomach.
Omentum.
Rt &amp;amp; Left ovaries (Krukenberg tumours).

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;KRUKENBERG, DISTAL STOMACH, OMENTUM&amp;quot;. A distal gastrectomy specimen consists of lesser curve, 60mm; greater curve, 130mm; and is up to 105mm in circumference with attached soft tissue at the lesser curve, up to 20mm; and greater curve, up to 15mm. Also received within the same specimen jar, is a fibrofatty piece of tissue consistent with omentum, 220x115x15mm; two grossly enlarged ovaries, 75x50x45mm, and 70x65x45mm; and a fibrofatty piece of tissue with covering peritoneum, 60x25x15mm.

The stomach has been opened across its greater curve. The cut surface reveals diffuse thickening of the stomach centrally over an area measuring 60x40mm which has cental  ulceration 15x10 mm. This lesional area is located within 5 mm of proximal and 55mm of distal margin. The corresponding serosa is hard, white and firm. The proximal margin is inked blue, distal is inked black. The lesional area is serially sliced. The cut surface reveals diffuse thickening and white strands approaching the serosal surface. Towards the distal edge at the greater curve, there is a well-demarcated serosal tumour, 10x10x5mm, with homogenous white cut surface which appears to be confined to the serosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ( as per block legend) with possible enlarged lymph nodes within 5 mm of the radial resection margin (inked green).

The cut surface of both ovaries is solid with oedematous mucinous tumor totally replacing the ovarian parenchyma.

No definite macroscopic involvement of the attached omentum is seen, but there are firm areas with overlying adhesions . No mucinous deposits are identified.

The attached piece of peritoneum has fibrotic white tubular structure with no obvious tumour nodules.

(1 distal margin; 2&amp;amp;3 continuous slice, proximal margin with lesional area; 4&amp;amp;5 one LS proximal margin with lesion  6&amp;amp;7 continuous lesional area with adjacent normal tissue towards the proximal edge; 8-10 continuous lesion with adjacent normal tissue towards the distal edge; 11 serosal well-demarcated nodule; 12&amp;amp;13 each containing nearest radial margin at the lesser curve and two lymph nodes; 14 five lesser curve lymph nodes; 15 five greater curve lymph nodes; 16 largest ovary, one TS, also tumour block for tissue banking; 17 smaller ovary; 18 attached peritoneum; 19&amp;amp;20 omentum).
