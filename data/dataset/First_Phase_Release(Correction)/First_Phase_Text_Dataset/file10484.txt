B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, ovaries, tubes, rectosigmoid colon&amp;#8221; consists of a segment of sigmoid colon and rectum with attached uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes.  The sigmoid colon is 140mm long and 50mm in diameter and the rectum measures 95mm long with a diameter of 40mm.  There is perirectal fat to a thickness of up to 35mm.  The ectocervix measures 27 x 15mm and has a smooth surface.  The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 50 mm.  The vaginal vault surgical margin is inked red, the rectal radial margin is inked black and the uterus anteriorly is inked blue.  Adherent to the rectosigmoid region is a flap of peritoneum measuring 80 x 65 x 7mm with a possible tumour deposit 30mm diameter.
There is a large collapsed cystic tumour mass in the left adnexa and extending between the colon/rectum and uterus.  It is adherent to the anterior surface of the sigmoid colon and rectum, and to the posterior uterus, cervix and vaginal cuff.  The left ovary and tube are not separately identified and are presumably involved in the mass.  The mass has a relatively smooth outer surface and measures 165 x 140 x 35mm.  It has a nodular surface with multiple tumour deposits up to 25mm in size.  The cut surface shows a unilocular cyst with a wall thickness between 3 and 25mm.  There are a few thin walled mucoid cysts on the bowel serosa, up to 75mm diameter, adjacent to the mass.
The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 7mm and the right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a diameter of 7mm.  The right tube and ovary are unremarkable.
Within the soft tissue surrounding the rectum there is a second tumour mass measuring 45 x 40 x 30mm; it has a smooth surface and appears to involve the rectal wall but does not involve the mucosa.  Within the sigmoid mesentery and perirectal fat there are multiple other small tumour deposits.  Within the wall of the sigmoid colon, 70mm from the proximal margin, there is a further tumour deposit measuring 50 x 40 x 45mm; it does not involve the mucosa.
The main cystic mass is firmly adherent to the posterior uterus and may also invade the outer posterior myometrium.  The endometrium is thin and there are multiple fibroids in the myometrium, up to 20mm in size.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Spleen, distal pancreas, descending, transverse, ascending colon&amp;#8221; consists of a length of small bowel 195mm long with ileocaecal valve and attached colon 490mm long.

On the large bowel there is a 5mm deposit situated 20mm from the ileocaecal valve, a 25mm deposit adjacent to the pancreas, and a 20mm deposit adjacent to the spleen, 90mm from the distal margin.  There are also several other smaller serosal deposits.  The mucosal surface of the bowel is unremarkable.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right diaphragm&amp;#8221; consists of fibromuscular tissue with one smooth surface and one roughened surface measuring 80 x 60 x 27mm.  The smooth surface has a nodular deposit measuring 20 x 12 x 5mm.  The opposite roughened surface has multiple tumour nodules; this surface is inked black.  On slicing, beneath the surface of the diaphragm, is a large variegated pink white tumour 75 x 55 x 16mm.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Michalowski):
A.  Sections show fibrofat with extensive involvement by a poorly differentiated, high grade serous carcinoma.
B.  Sections of the large cystic mass show poorly differentiated high grade serous carcinoma.  The cyst wall is thick and fibromuscular, with serous carcinoma within the wall and on part of the inner aspect of the cyst; no ovarian or fallopian tube tissue is identified in the sections examined.  There is also some tumour on the outer aspect of the cyst.  Sections from the region of the vaginal vault and the posterior cervix show extensive subserosal tumour.  No tumour is seen invading the vaginal cuff itself and the distal vaginal cuff margin is free of tumour.  The distal soft tissue margin in this region also appears to be free of tumour.
There is extensive tumour adherent to the serosa of the posterior uterus.  There is some tumour invasion of the outer myometrium of the posterior uterus, including some lymphovascular invasion in this region.  There is some serosal tumour on the anterior fundus of the uterus.  The endometrium is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.
Sections of the right ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable.
Sections of the perirectal tumour show similar serous carcinoma.  It is subserosal and there is no definite involvement of the rectal wall.
Sections confirm a subserosal tumour deposit on the sigmoid colon, 70mm from the proximal margin; this deposit does not involve the bowel wall.
Sections show multiple subserosal tumour deposits in the sigmoid mesentery.  Two unremarkable mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.  Some of the deposits in the mesentery may be replacing lymph nodes.
C.  Sections confirm numerous subserosal tumour deposits on the small and large bowel, in the hilum of the spleen and elsewhere in the spleen.  A subserosal small bowel deposit closest to the proximal margin extends through the muscularis propria into the small bowel submucosa but the mucosa is intact.  Other serosal deposits on the small and large bowel do not involve the bowel wall.
The tail of pancreas is free of tumour.  One normal peripancreatic lymph node is identified.
The spleen is unremarkable, apart from the hilar and intra-parenchymal tumour deposits.
A total of nine mesenteric lymph nodes are identified which are all free of tumour.  A few small extranodal tumour deposits are identified in the mesentery.
D.  Sections show skeletal muscle and dense fibrous tissue with overlying serosa.  There is tumour present extensively within the tissue and involving the serosal surface.  It involves the dense fibrous tissue but no involvement of the skeletal muscle is seen in the sections examined.
E.  Sections show fibrofat with a serosal surface.  There is extensive tumour involvement of the fibrofat and serosa.  No muscle is seen in the sections examined.  Two unremarkable small lymph nodes are present within the fat.
F.  Sections of appendix show fibrous obliteration of the appendix tip.  There are some serosal deposits of serous carcinoma but the appendix is otherwise unremarkable.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Omentum nodule:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
B.  Uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, rectosigmoid colon:
1.  Serous carcinoma of left ovary with extensive involvement of pouch of Douglas.
2.  Tumour deposits in perirectal soft tissue, sigmoid mesentery, sigmoid serosa and anterior uterine serosa.
C.  Spleen, distal pancreas and colon:  Serous carcinoma involving serosa and wall of small bowel, serosa of large bowel, splenic hilum and spleen, and mesentery.
D.  Diaphragm:  Serous carcinoma.
E.  Diaphragm:  Serous carcinoma.
F.  Appendix:  Serosal deposits of serous carcinoma.
