CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate 3 + 4 right lobe.  Prostate and pelvic nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate", consists of a prostate which measures 50 x 45 x 55mm and weighing 68g.  The right vas deferens measures 25mm in length and left vas deferens measures 17mm in length.  The right seminal vesicle measures 25 x 40 x 10mm and the left seminal vesicle measures 20 x 37 x 14mm.  There is a bludging nodule arising from the anterior prostate whichmeasures 30 x 30 x 27mm.  The left half is inked blue and right black with anterior red.  The prostate is transversely sectioned into 4 slices.  Slices 1 (apex) slices 4 (base) are further parasagittaly sectioned. Specimen AE. 
Blocks: 1 to 19 - 59 slice 4 (base); 24 and 25, 26 and 27; 28 and 29; 30 and 31; 32 and 33; 34 and 35; 36 and 37, 38 and 39;40 and 41; 42 and 43; 44 and 45; 46 and 47; 52 and 53; 54 and 55; 56 and 57; 58 and 59 are composite blocks with posterior first; 60 to 61 - TS of the right vas deferens; 62 to 71 - LS of right seminal vesicle;72 to 73- TS of the left vas deferens; 74 to 83 - LS of left seminal vesicles.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node", consists of multiple lymph nodes are identified.  All lymph node material embedded in 2 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic lymph node", consists of fibrofatty tissue which measures 60 x 25 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2- one lymph node bisected.
