CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 56g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 55 x 45 x 30mm.  The ectocervix is 22 x 22mm.  The endometrium is <1mm thick.  In the left cornual region along the posterior wall there is a polypoid lesion, 10 x 10 x 3mm.  The remainder of the endometrium appears <1mm thick.  The myometrium is 14mm thick.  The left fallopian tube is 55mm in length and 4mm in diameter and the left ovary is 25 x 15 x 5mm.  The right fallopian tube is 60mm in length and 5mm in diameter and the right ovary is 25 x 15 x 5mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 8 - remainder ofanterior endometrial cavity; 9 & 10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 & 12 - left cornual polypoidlesion; 13 to 15 - remainder of posterior endometrial cavity; 16 - left ovary and fallopian tube; 17 - right ovary and fallopian tube.  Endometrial cavity AE.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Stillwagon):
Sections show grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, confined to the endometrium.  The lesion is composed of complex back-to-back glands lined by tumour cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia. Squamous morules are present. No significant solid component or grade 3 nuclei are seen, in keeping with a grade of 1. Background complex hyperplasia with atypia is present.
There is no evidence of invasion into the myometrium or lymphovascular invasion.
The uninvolved endometrium is inactive. Benign leiomyomas are seen. 
The cervix showsno evidence of malignancy.
The fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable. 

DIAGNOSIS
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 1, confined to the endometrium
