CLINICAL:
Melanoma metastasis ?primary site.  Background of pancreatic cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left axillary tissue, stitch marking apex" consists of a large piece of fatty tissue with a suture for orientation marking the apex.  The specimen measures 150 x 110 x 30mm.  Specimen is serially sectioned from the apex to the base.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 5 to 30mm.  The largest lymph node appears replaced by necrotic tumour.  
Blocks:  1- apical node; 2- several lymph nodes; 3 - representative section of the largest lymph node; 4 to 12 - lymph node.  (TO:  RA  YZ/mm 12.2.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Devaul)
Sections show a 30mm deposit of metastatic malignant melanoma in one of seventeen lymph nodes (1/17). The malignant melanoma consists of sheets of malignant epithelioid to rhabdoid cells with conspicuous nucleoli and eosinophilicrhabdoid cytoplasm. There are broad areas of necrosis. The melanoma is strongly positive for S100 and MelanA and shows focal positivity with HMB45. There is extranodal extension of at least 0.56mm.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left axillary tissue: 30mm deposit of metastatic malignant melanoma in one of seventeen lymph nodes (1/17).
