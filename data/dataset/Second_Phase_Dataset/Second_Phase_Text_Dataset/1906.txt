CLINICAL:
73 female.  Endometrial cancer.  Suspicious node on MRI.  Abnormal nodes felt intraop.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 108g. The uterus measures 70 x 55 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there isa polypoid lesion present in the endometrial canal measuring 35 x 30mm.  The lesion starts in the fundus and extends to the body. It appears that the main bulk of the tumour is present on the posterior aspect of the endometrial canal.  Further sections show that the tumour invades 11 out of 25mm of the myometrial thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 5mm in diameter. The right ovary measures 30 x 10 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut section.  The left fallopian tube measures 25mm in length and 5mm in diameter. The fimbrial end is not identified.  The ovary measures 12x 10 x 10mm.  
Blocks 1-4 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 5-9 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10-13 - representative sections of possible deepest invasion on the posterior aspect; 14 - fallopian tube and fimbrial end on the right side; 15 - right ovary; 16 - fallopian tube on the left side; 17 - left ovary. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 135 x 60 x 30mm.  The specimen is serially TS. The cut surfaces are unremarkable.  No focal lesion or lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections in 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental adhesion", consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 5mm. AE 1 block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 75 x 40 x 10mm. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging from 10-20mm.  Block 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node; 3 - one lymph node. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left hypogastric lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 30x 20 x 10mm. Two lymph nodes are identified ranging from 10-20mm.  Block 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2- one bisected lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue ranging from 20-35mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3-20mm.  Block 1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - one lymph node AE. 
G. Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 45 x 25 x 15mm.  One lymph node is identified measuring 20 x 10 x 10mm.  The entire lymph node embedded in 2 blocks.  
H.  Specimen labelled "Paraortic lymph nodes", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 30 x 25 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes are present ranging from 17-22mm. Block 1- one lymph node; 2-one lymph node. AE.  (JY/ec  13.11.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Sholders):
A.  Sections show serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  Carcinoma invades to a depth of 19mm through a wall thickness of 24mm.  Focal perineural invasion is present aswell as extensive lymphovascular invasion.  No invasive tumour is seen within the cervix however, multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion are present, some of which come close to the ectocervical margin.  Deposits of serous adenocarcinoma are also present on the right fallopian tube and both the right and left ovaries.  The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.
B & C.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One (1) of the three (3) lymph nodes identified show metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.  The deposit is 2.5mm across with no extranodal spread.
E.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified contain metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.  The largest deposit is up to 9mm across with no extranodal spread however, lymphovascular invasion is present within adjacent adipose tissue.
F.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  The single (1) lymph node identified contains metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.  The deposit is greater than 10mm across with no extranodal spread however, lymphovascular invasion is present within adjacent adipose tissue.
H.  The two (2) lymph nodes identified contain metastatic serous adenocarcinoma.  The largest deposit is great than 10mm across with extranodal spread.
DIAGNOSES:
A - H.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, omentum, pelvic lymph nodes and hypogastric lymph nodes:
- Serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
- Invasion to a depth of 19mm through a wall thickness of 24mm.
- Extensive lymphovascular invasion extending into ectocervix.
- Serous adenocarcinoma involving right fallopian tube and both ovaries.
- Omentum negative.
- Six positive lymph nodes.
