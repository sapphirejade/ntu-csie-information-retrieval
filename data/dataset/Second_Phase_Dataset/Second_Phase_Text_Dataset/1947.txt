HISTORY:
Front (anterior) of vena cava. Peritonectomy. Frozen section. 
Appendix cancer. Debulking. Abdominal wall, diaphragm, omentum. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "FRONT OF VENA CAVA". Two pieces of tissue, measuring  4mm,5mm. 
F/S: "Adenocarcinoma". Reported by Dr M Consla. 
(1 frozen section tissue). AE (M-1).
B. "OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, DIAPHRAGM". 
Omentum- A section of omentum measuringup to 250x120x30mm. There are multiple haemorrhagic and firm areas. On sectioning no definite tumour deposits identified. 
(1-6 representative omentum).
Diaphragm - Multiple fragments of diaphragm measuring an aggregate of 80x80x50mm. On one piece there is a rough adhesion ?tumour deposit, and two pieces have underlying pale firm areas up to 30mm in maximum extent extending to muscle tissue. 
(7 surface rough areas; 8&9 pale areas [block8 tumour reserve block]). 
Peritoneum - Multiple pieces of peritoneum, measuring an aggregate of 40x40x30mm. The pieces are irregular and rough. No definite tumour deposit identified. 
(10-12 representative sections). RS (M-12/AS/ht).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. M. Zill)
A. Paraffin section confirms infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within fibrous tissue. 
B. Sectionsof the omentum show fibroadipose tissue in which there is focal foreign body giant cell reaction. Within the multinucleated histiocytes, faecal material of vegetable nature is noted. 
Sections from the diaphragm show striatedmuscle surrounded by fat. There is infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour involves the muscle and extends to the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. There is focal necrosis. At the edges of the tumour, there is focal lymphatic permeation. 
Sections of the peritoneum show focal depositions of tumour. There is fibrosis and focal foreign body giant cell reaction. 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  FRONT OF VENA CAVA - ADENOCARCINOMA. 
B. OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, DIAPHRAGM -
 - ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING PERITONEUM AND DIAPHRAGM.
