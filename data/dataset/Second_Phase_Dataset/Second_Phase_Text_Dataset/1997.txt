CLINICAL:
AdenoCa distal oesophagus.  Post chemo.  No radiation.  Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimenlabelled "Distal oesophagus", consists of an Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy, with distal oesophagus 50mm in length and 50mm circumference, with proximal stomach 65 x 55 x 40mm.  There is attached greater omentum 85 x 65 x 25mm.  There is attached lesser omentum 65 x 30 x 10mm.  At the distal oesophagus the mucosa appears diffusely tan and granular spanning a length 28mm.  There is a polypoid area, 18 x 10 x 5mm located at the lateral distal oesophagus.  The abnormal oesophageal mucosa is 20mm clear of the proximal margin and 60mm clear of the distal margin.  The proximal oesophageal and the gastric mucosa appear unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - LS proximal oesophageal margin (block 1 lateral, 2 anterior, 3 medial, 4 posterior); 5 to 19 - distal oesophagus serially embedded (5 and 6 paired sections lateral; 7 and 8 - paired sections anterior; 9 and 10 - paired sections anterior; 11 - anterior; 12 and 13 - medial; 14 - posterior; 15 and 16 - posterior; 17 - posterior; 18 and 19 - lateral); 20 - distal gastric margin; 21 - one paraoesophageal lymph node; 22 - multiple paraoesophageal lymph nodes; 23 - one perigastric lymph node; 24 to 26 - multiple perigastric lymph nodes. 
(EC/vo 2.6.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Stringham & registrar Dr W Derousselle):
Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus junction.  The features are as follows:
Macroscopic description

Tumour site:  Distal oesophagus
Maximum tumour diameter:  50mm
Distance to nearest margin:  20mm (proximal)

Microscopic Description

Tumour site (location):
Gastro-oesophageal junction
Tumour type:
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
Local invasion (pT):
T1b	Tumour invades submucosa
Serosal/adventitial surface involvement:
Absent
Vascular space invasion:
Small vessels (lymphatic and capillary):  Suspicious
	
Large vessels (vein and artery):  Absent
Perineural growth:
Absent
Degree of regression after preoperative chemotherapy:
Grade 3:  Absent response (Minimal or no tumourkill; extensive residual cancer)
Surgical margins:
Distance to proximal margin:  10mm
Distance to distal margin:  Well clear
Distance to radial/circumferential margin:  10mm
Number of involved regional nodes/total number of region nodes (pN):
Number of lymph nodes present:  16
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0
N0regional lymph node metastasis
Metastatic sites (pM):
MX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Other features:
The carcinoma arises adjacent to areas of low grade and high grade oesophageal glandular dysplasia with focal intestinal metaplasia.  The gastric mucosa shows no significant abnormality.


DIAGNOSIS:
Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy:  
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, margins clear
- Invasion into submucosa
- 16 negative lymph nodes 
- ypT1b N0 MX
