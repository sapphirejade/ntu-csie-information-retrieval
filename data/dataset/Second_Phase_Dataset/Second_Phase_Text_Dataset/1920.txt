HISTORY:  
Mixed serous and endometrioid adenocarcinoma MSI preserved. 
(1) Peritoneal washings
(2) Uterus, tubes and ovaries
(3) Omental biopsy
(4) Left pelvic nodes
(5) Right pelvic nodes.
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES". Uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The right fallopian tube is 50x5mm and the right ovary is 25x10x10mm. There are two nodules present on the right side, the first is attached to the ovary on external surface and is 8mm in diameter. It has a solid, tan cut surface. There is a nodule 4mm in diameter attached to the fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube. It is solid and has a yellow cut surface. The left fallopian tube is 45x5mm and has a cyst towards the fimbrial end which has a smooth, shinny external surface. A wall less than 1mm in thickness and a lumen filled with transparent fluid. The left ovary is 25x10x10mm and has a nodule attached to the external surface similar to the nodule on the right side. Itis 8mm in maximum dimension and has a solid, tan cut surface. The uterus alone weighs 50g and is 60mm from fundus to ectocervix. The uterine body is 45mm wide and 30mm from the anterior to posterior. The uterine cervix is 30x25mm. The external cervical os is 15x5mm. The endometrium appears to be 2-3mm in thickness and the myometrium is trabeculated and approximately 10mm in thickness. No mass lesion is seen in the endometrial canal. 
(1-6 sagittal sections x2, through anterior cervix [1-3 cervix body, fundus; 4-6 cervix, body, fundus]; 7-12 sagittal sections x 2, though posterior uterine body [7,8&9 cervix, body and fundus; 10,11&12 cervix, body and fundus]; 13-16 fimbrial end of right fallopian tube and entire ovary embedded; 17-20 left ovary and fallopian tube [17&18 ovary; 19 fimbrial end, fallopian tube; 20 TSs). RS (M-20) Further tissue 21-41 remaining endometrium and cervical tissue RS BI
Further tissue: 
(42-44 remaining fallopian tube 1; 45-47 remaining fallopian tube 2 [all fallopian tube embedded, not all tissue embedded]).  RS (M-6/CN/ank)
B. "OMENTAL BIOPSY". Strip of fatty tissue, 50x10mm. No nodules or -----area arepresent. AE (2-2)
C. "LEFT PELVIC NODES". Multiple pieces of fatty tissue, ----60x40x15mm. Within which there are five possible nodes.
(1 two nodes; 2 one node, in four; 3 one node, in four; 4&5 one node, in four). All lymph nodes embedded, not all fatty tissue embedded). (M-5)
D. "RIGHT PELVIC NODE". Piece of fatty tissue, approximately 60x40x20mm. Within which there are 9 nodes. 
(1&2 one node; 3 two nodes; 4 two nodes; 5 two nodes; 6 one node; 7 one node). AE All lymph nodes but not all fatty tissue embedded. (M-7/UZ/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr S Loeza)
A. Sections of the cervix show unremarkable ectocervical squamous mucosa. The endocervical columnar mucosa shows no atypia. The endometrium appears atrophic, with focal adenomyosis. In one area (Block A6), from the anterior fundus, there is a 3mm circumscribed area of Grade 1-2 endometrial adenocarcinoma, which appears tobe partially enclosed within a dilated endometrial gland, and shows some mucinous features. No myometrial  invasion is seen. There is no serous differentiation. The remainder of the endometrium has been embedded and examined, and a single further focus of grade 1-2 endometrial carcinoma is seen in block A40, which also shows no myometrial invasion. No endometrial hyperplasia is seen in the remainder of the endometrium. The myometrium and serosal surface is unremarkable. 
Sections of the right ovary show a semi-detached infarcted appendix epiploica with focal dystrophic calcification. The right ovary shows atrophic changes consistent with age. Sections of the right fallopian tube are unremarkable. Sections of the left ovary also show an attached, completely infarcted appendix epiploica with focal calcification, attached to the serosal surface of the ovary. The ovary also shows atrophic changes consistent with the age. Sections of the left fallopian tube are unremarkable.
Any remaining fallopian tube tissue will be embedded and examined, with a supplementary report to follow.
B. The omental biopsy has been completely embedded and shows lobulated mature adipose tissue only. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined. 
C. The five pelvic lymph nodes show mild reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined. 
D. The nine pelvic lymph nodes show mild reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy in the tissue examined.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES 
- FOCAL GRADE 1-2 ENDOMETRIAL ADENOCARCINOMA, WITH NO INVASION, IN THE ANTERIOR FUNDUS. CORRELATION WITH THE PREVIOUS HISTOLOGY REPORT IS REQUIRED.
- ATROPHIC ENDOMETRIUM AND FOCAL ADENOMYOSIS. 
B. OMENTAL BIOPSY
- NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY DETECTED.
C. LEFT PELVIC NODES
- THE FIVE LYMPH NODES SHOW MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.
D. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
- THE NINE LYMPH NODES SHOW MILD REACTIVE CHANGES ONLY.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:
SPECIMEN A: 
The remainder of the fallopian tubes (blocks A42 to A47) have been embedded and examined,and are unremarkable.
