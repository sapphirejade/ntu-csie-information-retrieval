CLINICAL:
Left breast mastectomy + sentinel lymph node biopsy.  Previous right breast cancer - right mastectomy.  Left breast ca - 1 o'clock position 4cm from nipple.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left sentinel node" and consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 50 x 38 x 15mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 5 and 15mm across.  The larger lymph node has blue dye discolouration.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - larger lymph node; 3 - smaller lymph node.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast" and consists of a mastectomy measuring 295 x 180 x 50mm.  There is overlying ellipse of skin 230 x 90mm.  The nipple and areolaappear unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin black.  At 1 o'clock, 4cm from the nipple is a tumour, 23 x 20 x 25mm.  The tumour lies entirely below the skin ellipse and is 20mm clear of the deep margin.  There is a second tumour nodule 11 x 10 x 10mm located at 12 o'clock 6cm from the nipple.  The second tumour nodule is 15mm from the first tumour nodule.  The second nodule is 24mm clear of the superficial margin and 45mm clear of thedeep margin.  The remainder of the breast is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - cross section through main tumour at 1 o'clock, 4cm FN; 4 - main tumour (reserve block); 5- deep margin overlying main tumour; 6 - tissue between the two tumours; 7 & 8 - second tumour at 12 o'clock, 6cm FN; 9 - superficial margin overlying second tumour; 10 - upper outer quadrant; 11 - lower outer quadrant; 12 - lower inner quadrant; 13 - upper inner quadrant; 14 - nipple.  Please refer to attached diagram.  (TO: JI; IE/ta 13/5/65)
