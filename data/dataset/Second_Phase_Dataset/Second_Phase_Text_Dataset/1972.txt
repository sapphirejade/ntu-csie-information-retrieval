CLINICAL:
Sphenoid sinus contents ?necrotic fat ?inflammatory tissue.  Pituitary adenoma.  
The sphenoid contents were divided with some tissue sent to microbiology.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Pituitarytumour", consists of multiple fragments of tan and haemorrhagic tissue from 2 to 5mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right sinus sphenoid contents", consists of fresh haemorrhagic dark brown material 20 x 5 x 3mm.  A piece 5 x 3 x 3mm in divided for microbiology the remainder AE 1 block. 
(TO: FF;QZ/vo 26.9.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Gobel):
A.  Sections show tumour tissue.  No normal pituitary is seen.  The tumour consists of groups and trabeculaeof cells with generally medium sized nuclei and a moderate amount of amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Nuclei are generally relatively uniform although scattered large nuclei with prominent nucleoli are noted.  The features are of apituitary adenoma.
Immunostains:
Growth hormone:  Positive.
Prolactin:  Negative.
TSH:  Negative.
FSH:  Negative.
LH:  Negative.
ACTH:  Negative.
B.  Sections show a fragment of necrotic material of uncertain nature, and a fragment of apparent old necrotic bone with associated regular benign cells.  These cells stain pancytokeratin positive but stains for growth hormone and CD68 are negative.  They are most consistent with detached mucosal epithelial cells.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Pituitary tumour:  Pituitary adenoma.
B.  Right sphenoid sinus contents:  Necrotic material, old necrotic bone and detached mucosal epithelial cells.
