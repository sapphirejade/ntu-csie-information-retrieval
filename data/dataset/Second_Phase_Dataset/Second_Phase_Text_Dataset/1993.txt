On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 13mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 17 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 15mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 30 x 12 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
