1094	 4709	 A.  Concern was raised at the Gynaecologic Oncology Meeting on 3.9.63 about the nature of a nodule on a fold of peritoneum between the bladder and cervix, which had not been sectioned.  The specimen was therefore re-examined.  A mucoid nodule around 10mm diameter was identified in the flap of peritoneum on the anterior endocervix, left side, and sections were taken (blocks A23 - A28).  The sections show only oedematous and inflammatory tissue with suture material from previous surgery; no tumour is seen.	 DATE:3.9.63=>2063-09-03

1127	 2111	 The sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour is 2mm from the closest resection margin (block 2).   Tumour emboli are present in thin walled dilated lymphovascular channels.  The tumour abuts large bile ducts and occasional tumour nests invade into bile ducts (block 5).  The tumour does not invade into the gallbladder.  The tumour is close (< 0.1mm) to the capsular surface but does not breach the capsule.   Metastatic squamous cell carcinomareplaces most of the cystic duct lymph node but without extracapsular spread (block 6).  The uninvolved liver shows patchy mild chronic inflammation in the portal tracts.  The gallbladder shows cholesterolosis and mild chronic cholecystitis.	 PHI:Null

1133	 2771	 A & B.  Specimens A and B show similar histopathologicalfeatures. The gastric tumour is a 120mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is adherent to and expands themuscularis propria and has a lobulated appearance. The tumour is variably moderately to highly cellular and is composed of plump to moderately atypical spindled cells arranged in interweaving fascicles with areas of nuclear palisading. In areas, the tumour cells show moderate cytologic atypia, including nuclear enlargement, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Foci of myxoid degeneration, haemorrhage and oedema are present throughout the tumour. Mitoses are present, with up to 49 mitoses per 50 high power fields. A focus of possible incipient tumour associated necrosis isseen. The tumour appears clear of the gastric resection margin. Although much of the tumour largely surrounded by a thin rim of fibrous tissue and some attenuated muscularis propria, focally the tumour extends to the inked (serosal) surface. There is no involvement of the overlying gastric submucosa or mucosa, which shows features of a patchy mild non-specific chronic gastritis.	 PHI:Null

1133	 3154	 COMMENT:	 PHI:Null
1133	 3741	 The gastric tumour shows morphologic and immunohistochemical features consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours greater than 100mm in size and with a high mitotic rate (greater than 10/50hpf), are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM). This tumour shows variably prominent moderate nuclear pleomorphism, which is of uncertain clinical significance, as cytologic atypia is not a reliable predictor of tumour behaviour in these tumours.

The gallbladder has been opened prior to receipt.  The liver resection margin is inked black.  The mucosa in the neck region and in most of the fundus appears unremarkable and the wall is 1-2mm in thickness.  However a firm masswith a granular surface is noted in the body, resulting in severe narrowing of the lumen. The serosal surface shows puckering in this area with fibroadipose tissue adhesions.  Sectioning through the tumour shows a circumferential, firm, irregular, off white tumour measuring approximately 33 x 30 x 17mm.  The tumour involves the full thickness of the gallbladder wall and appears to infiltrate the attached fat as well.  The tumour shows sharp borders with the underlying liver and is at least 7mm from the liver resection margin.  The liver appears macroscopically unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified.

1141	 2639	 Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of gallbladder.  This appears to be of biliary type.  There is some gland formation but much of the tumour consists of solid cords and trabeculae of cells.  The tumour cells have medium sized and large, vesicular nuclei and amoderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour invades through the gallbladder wall and extends into adherent fat.  It extends to just beneath the serosal surface of the gallbladder and adherent fat.  It also focally invades into the attached liver segment but the hepatic resection margin is well clear.  Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are identified within the tumour but not outside the main mass.  The vascular invasion includes involvement of at least one small muscular artery.	 PHI:Null

1141	 3287	 A section of liver away from the tumour shows some mild, non-specific inflammatory changes.  There is no hepatic fibrosis.  A perl stain shows an increase in stainable iron in hepatocytes (grade 2+ out of 4).  The hepatocytes with increased iron aremainly periportal.  The possibility of hereditary haemochromatosis should be considered.  A rhodanine stain shows no increase in copper, no alpha one antitrypsin globules are seen, and an orcein stain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative.	 PHI:Null

1159	 9567	 The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even withinthese high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	 PHI:Null

1164	 2321	 MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Zermeno):	 DOCTOR:F Zermeno
1164	 4529	 Sections show a dedifferentiated liposarcoma, 135mm in maximum dimension. The subfascial tumour has a multinodular configuration and shows a predominantly abrupt transition from well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma to dedifferentiated myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma (myxoid MFH)-like areas. The skin and subcutis are uninvolved.  The transition between the well and dedifferentiated components is generally abrupt, however, focal intermingled areas (block 13) are also noted.  Although most of the tumour is well demarcated by a fibrous pseudocapsule and/or adjacent atrophic muscle, well differentiated tumour infiltrates skeletal muscle superficially and laterally (blocks5 &13).  The moderately cellular dedifferentiated component (approximately 60% of the tumour) is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells with hyperchromatic, often angulated nuclei, occasionally prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with intracytoplasmic hyaline globules. The pleomorphic tumour cells are arranged in a storiform pattern and haphazardly.  The stroma of the dedifferentiated component is fibromxyoid and contains a supporting capillary-like vasculature which focally appears plexiform and there is patchy mild associated chronic inflammation.   In the latter areas, the tumour shows features superficially resembling myxoid liposarcoma, however, the degree of nuclear atypia and association with a well differentiated liposarcoma component excludes that diagnosis.  The dedifferentiated component shows broad areas (estimated 40% of the total tumour volume) of therapy-related coagulative necrosis.  Mitoses are generally inconspicuous but, in the most proliferative areas, number up to 4 per 10 HPF including atypical forms.  Within the well differentiated areas, enlarged hyperchromatic angulated stromal cells and multivacuolated lipoblasts are easily identified.  Focally fibrous scar tissue and foreign body type giant cells are noted adjacent to tumour.  The dedifferentiated component of the tumour shows similar histological features to the previous incisional biopsy (21I76240).	 IDNUM:21I76240
1164	 4533	 	 PHI:Null
1164	 5048	 Close to the superficialmargin moderately cellular pleomorphic dedifferentiated tumour merges with less cellular, less pleomorphic mitotically active atypical spindled and stellate ganglion-like cells. The latter component, favoured to represent dedifferentiated tumour over a reactive proliferation of myofibroblasts, infiltrates skeletal muscle and reaches the inked resection margin. The superficial margin is therefore regarded as suspicious for involvement by sarcoma. The remaining margins aredetailed below.	 PHI:Null

1169	 1319	 The sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal adenocarcinoma.  The lesion is about 3mm from the resection margin and reaches close to the liver capsule.  The uninvolved liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis and moderate chronic inflammation in the portal tracts.  The tumour cells express CDX2 and keratin 20 antigens by the immunoperoxidase method.  Keratin 7 antigen is expressed in biliary cells and some adjacent hepatocytes but not in the tumour cells. The immunophenotype is consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.	 PHI:Null

1186	 3687	 TEST DESCRIPTION	 PHI:Null
1186	 4135	 The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).  Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation.  This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.

1186	 4218	 INTERPRETATION	 PHI:Null
1186	 4375	 The p. Val600Glu (V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was detected, which indicates that this tumour is unlikely to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors.	 PHI:Null
1186	 4384	 Comments	 PHI:Null
1186	 4994	 BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1.2].  V600E specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g. Vemurafenib) have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.  Trials of Vemurafenib have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3].  The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [4].	 PHI:Null

1186	 5638	 Summary:	 PHI:Null
1186	 5882	 The somatic BRAF mutation V600E was PRESENT in tumour DNA from this patient. This finding indicates that methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter may be present but should be interpreted in association with other laboratory and clinical findings.	 PHI:Null

1186	 5956	 Background:	 PHI:Null
1186	 6428	 Absence of MLH1 gene expression in a tumour can be due to heritable or somatic mutations in the MLH1 gene. Heritable mutations cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) whereas somatic mutations cause non-familial cancers. A common type of somatic mutation involving the MLH1 gene is epigenetic silencing due to methylation of the promoter; epigenetic mutations are rarely familial. Hence the loss of MLH1 gene expression due to promoter	 PHI:Null
1186	 6523	 methylation makes if very unlikely that the patient has a heritable mutation in the MLH1 gene.	 PHI:Null
1186	 6898	 A specific somatic mutation in the BRAF gene, c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu or V600E), is a useful surrogate marker for methylation of the MLH1 promoter in tumour tissue. The absence of the V600E mutation in tumour tissue is strongly associated (>95%) with absence of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. Absence of the V600E mutation is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, HNPCC.	 PHI:Null
1186	 7114	 The presence of the V600E mutation is associated (75%) with methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of the V600E mutation indicates that HNPCC is unlikely but does not exclude other familial cancer syndromes.	 PHI:Null
1186	 7122	 Method:	 PHI:Null
1186	 7439	 Mutation testing is performed on DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. A region including nucleotide 1799 is amplified by PCR and the presence of the T>Amutation is determined by a single nucleotide primer extension assay. This assay will detect a mutation that is present in 5% or more of cells tested.	 PHI:Null

1203	 9649	 The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to 30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even within these high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	 PHI:Null

1216	 1562	 A & B.  Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  In specimen B there are also pieces ofessentially normal cerebral cortex and white matter.  The tumour is cellular and consists of cells withgenerally large, pleomorphic atypical nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are frequent mitoses, numbering up to 30 per 10 high power fields.  There is also microvascular proliferation and palisaded tumour necrosis.  In one section the tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and there is a prominent associated desmoplastic stromal reaction; this ispossibly an area of dural invasion.  The appearances are of glioblastoma.	 PHI:Null

The capsule contains residual salivary gland ducts with associated fibrosis and collections of chronic inflammatory cells.  The tumour exhibits a varied morphologic pattern with cellular areas alternating with loose, myxoid and chondromyxoid stroma.  In addition central areas of marked stromal hyalinisation are identified. The cellular areas contain sheets of myoepithelial cells withinterspersed ductal structures.  The ducts exhibit a biphasic arrangement with inner ductal cells and abluminal myoepithelial cells.  The myxoid areas contain spindled, stellate as well as plasmacytoid appearing myoepithelial cells.  The myoepithelial cells have large, vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and occasional mitoses are noted.  Focally necrosis is observed with associated granulation tissue and fibrosis.	 PHI:Null
1226	 4847	 The tumour abuts the soft tissue plane of excision focally.  In addition, focal intravascular tumour is noted within the fibrous capsule.	 PHI:Null
1226	 4857	 COMMENT:	 PHI:Null
1226	 5154	 Atypical pleomorphic adenomas exhibit some features that raise concern about the potentialbiologic behaviour; however these features are insufficient on their own to attest malignancy.  These include intravascular tumour in small vessels in or adjacent to the capsule as well as cytologic atypia.	 PHI:Null

1227	 1190	 Sections show liver tissue with a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.  This has a lobular outline and consists of thick trabeculae of cells with large, highly pleomorphic nuclei and generally abundant bright eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Many of the nuclei have a single, prominent nucleolus.  The tumour is quite well circumscribed.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The tumour extends to just beneath the overlying liver capsule but the capsule is intact.  The liver resection margin is free of tumour.  The tumour is 5mm from the margin of the closest point.	 PHI:Null
1227	 1521	 Liver tissue immediately adjacent to the tumour shows prominent fibrosis, replacing virtually all the parenchyma.  Sections of liver tissue away from the tumour show an irregular cavity which contains inspissated bile and has surrounding dense fibrous tissue; this is consistent with a previous surgical or tumour ablation site.	 PHI:Null
1227	 2091	 Some better preserved liver tissue is alsoseen away from the tumour.  This shows fibrous expansion of portal tracts and some fibrous bands but reasonably intact architecture, without obvious cirrhosis.  There is a moderate infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes, in portal tracts and fibrous bands.  There is mild, focal piecemeal necrosis.  There is mild, patchy microvesicular steatosis.  There is no increase in stainable iron or copper, no Alpha 1 antitrypsin globules are seen and an Orceinstain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative.	 PHI:Null

1242	 2624	 A.  Sections of the ovarian tumour show extensive haemorrhage and necrosis.  Remaining intact tumour is composed mainly of cells with large, highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, oftenone or more nucleoli, and a moderate amount of clear or basophilic cytoplasm.  These cells are in solid groups and also from prominent loose, interconnected spaces (reticular pattern).  Eosinophilic globules are identified in the cytoplasm of many tumour cells.  In some of the tumour there are spaces lined by more regular columnar or cuboidal cells.  Schiller-Duval bodies are identified in one section (block A18).

1255	 1700	 A - C.  Specimens A - C show similar histopathological features. Sections are of fibroadipose tissue containing metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of infiltrative solid sheets and variably thick trabeculae, with scattered admixed glandular lumina and foci of squamoid differentiation. There is tumour associated necrosis. Adenocarcinoma extends to the edge of the biopsies in areas.	 PHI:Null

1255	 1910	 COMMENT:	 PHI:Null
1255	 2449	 The omental, descending colon and subumbilical nodules are foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma. In the appropriate clinical context, the overall morphology (including focal squamoid differentiation) and pattern of immunohistochemical staining, would be in keepin with metastatic (grade 3) endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. No previous pathology is directly available for comparison. However, given the ER and PR, as well as, focal TTF-1 positivity, the possibility of metastatic breast or lung carcinoma, cannot be entirely excluded.	 PHI:Null

1269	 3157	 Sections of the tumour show a relatively uniform appearance throughout.  It is moderately cellular and consists of spindle-shaped cells in a mainly myxoid stroma.  The tumour cells have medium-sized and large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei and wispy eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are occasional multinucleate tumour cells.  Nuclear chromatin is rather bland but some nuclei have a single prominent nucleolus.  Mitoses number up to around 6/10 HPF.The tumour cells are arranged in short, haphazard fascicles.  No differentiating features are seen with routine staining.	 PHI:Null
1269	 3667	 The tumour has an infiltrative appearance, invading fat at the periphery (eg. blocks 6, 7).

1279	 3582	 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:	 PHI:Null
1279	 4120	 Examination of multiple sections through the right parotid gland confirm the presence of the major serous gland in which there is prominent fatty infiltration. The glandular parenchyma shows multiple periductal aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells which are composed of lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells. Intervening fibrovascular connective tissue septae are present which contain dilated collecting ducts and neurovascular bundles. Surrounding fibro-fatty connective tissue and non-ganglionated nerve fibres are identified.	 PHI:Null
1279	 5198	 Within the substance of the gland, an infiltrative tumour is identified which exhibits a varied histomorphologic pattern with lobular, microcystic, follicular and cystic spaces being noted. The individual tumour cells are large, polygonal and have finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with large oval nuclei showing prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are observed. Prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation is also identified. Special stains confirm the presence of very occasional diastase resistant granules within cell cytoplasm of occasional tumour cells and abundant mucicarmine positive secretion. The larger tumour follicles contain eosinophilic secretion with peripheral scalloping being identified. Tumour cells have entrapped nerve fibres of varying size with focal perineural infiltration being observed (block 5) Focally, a large cystic area is noted which is lined by large, hobnail appearing cells which have vacuolated cytoplasm. Interspersed areas of necrosis with associated inflammatory cells are identified and the intervening stroma shows variable hyalinisation.	 PHI:Null

1279	 5643	 COMMENT	 PHI:Null
1279	 6310	 The differential diagnosis considered includes a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary gland origin (MASC) and acinic cell carcinoma. Prior to the categorisationof MASC as a separate diagnostic entity by Skalova et al in 2010, this tumour would most likely have been categorised as an acinic cell carcinoma. In view of the presence of positive staining for GCDFP-15 + mammaglobin, a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is favoured. It appears thus far from limited evidence that the biologic behaviour of MASC is very similar to acinic cell adenocarcinoma, and if one is interpreted as the other, it probably has no implications for therapy or prognosis.

1286	 4313	 A. Sections of the right adnexal mass show a poorly differentiated carcinoma with a variable architectural pattern.  Most of the tumour is composed of sheets of highly pleomorphic neoplastic cells traversed by hyalinised fibrovascular septa.  Insular and trabecular patterns of growth were also seen.  In addition, there are areas within the tumour which exhibit gland-like microspaces which often contain mucin.  Cytologically, the neoplastic cells show marked pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli.  Scattered tumour giant cells as well as large cells with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei are also seen.  Mitoses and apoptotic cells are present but extensivenecrosis is not a prominent feature. Lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The lining of the cyst wall consists of multilayered epithelium composed of neoplastic cells with similar cytological features as that of the more solid areas.	 PHI:Null
1286	 4617	 The features are of a poorly differentiated Mullerian carcinoma which is difficult to classify.

1303	 4823	 Sectionsshow a circumferential ulcerated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the rectum.  The tumour is composed of scattered, often widely separated, small tubular malignant glands or more complex glandular structures which invade through the muscularis propria reaching the interface of the expanded fibrotic subserosa with mesentery.  No single cell invasion is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  Anteriorly, in an area presumably covered by serosa (mesothelial layer denuded) the tumour extends close to but does not penetrate the presumed serosal surface and there is associated organising haemorrhage but no adhesions are seen.  The ulcerated area of mucosa shows no residual carcinoma but there are adjacent foci of atypical mucosal glands including definite focal high grade dysplasia within the confines of the tumour.  There is a mild response to neoadjuvant therapy with moderate stromal fibrosis and a patchygiant cell reaction to foci of dystrophic calcification (the latter almost abutting the presumed serosal surface); these changes are limited to the rectal wall with no significant stromal alteration within the mesorectum.  Other features of radiotherapy effect include hyaline alteration of vessel walls and intimal foamy histiocytes.  The non-neoplastic mucosa shows patchy chronic architectural disorder with irregular and branched crypts.  No basal plasmacytosis or granulomas are seen and the crypt architectural changes may relate to therapy induced chronic ulceration.	 PHI:Null

The fibroadenoma is composed of ducts with a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern surrounded by variably fibromyxoid stroma. Focally, some of the ducts within the fibroadenoma show changes consistent with atypical lobular hyperplasia/lobular carcinoma in situ (ALH/LCIS), focal epithelial hyperplasia and squamoid metaplasia. The fibroadenoma extends to the inked/diathermied margins in areas (superior and deep margins). Foci of ALH/LCIS appear clear of margins (2.5mm from the superior margin and 6.0mm from the deep margin). The adjacent breast tissue shows changes of a recent biopsy site, focal epithelial hyperplasia, numerous dilated ducts and focal benign micro-calcification.

1307	 3176	 A.  Sections show a grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), Bloom and Richardson score 9 (t = 3, n = 3, m = 3).  The IDC is poorly circumscribed and is present in slices 6 to 10 (5 slices).  The estimated tumour size is 35mm (medial-lateral) x 30mm (superior-inferior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  The superficial margin is positive in two (2) of the slices and the deep margin is close (clearance 0.6mm).  IDC also infiltrates close to the medial margin with tumour present in the most medial slice (slice 10).  However, the IDC 'cuts out' on levelling through this slice and the estimated clearance is 1mm.  The superior and inferior margins are both 4mm clear and the lateral margin is well clear (no tumour in slices 1 to 5).	 PHI:Null

1315	 2976	 A.  The 45mm tumour is an invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma displays a mixed lepidic (70%) and acinar growth (30%) pattern the latter comprising angulated glands within a cellular chronically inflamed stroma, mainly around or within an area of subpleural scarring and elastosis. The crowded moderately pleomorphic tumour cells display enlarged elongated grooved nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli, occasional intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm. Focally sebaceous-like features are present with cytoplasmic microvacuolation.  A minor component shows mucinousdifferentiation, highlighted with dPAS staining (block A5).  In several foci lepidic tumour shows continuity with ciliated respiratory epithelium.  The carcinoma abuts but does not penetrate the elastic layer of the pleura (PL0) (highlighted with orcein stains) and there is associated pleural retraction and foci of mild mesothelial hyperplasia.  The vascular and bronchial resection margins are uninvolved and well clear (40mm-macroscopic) of tumour. The stapled resectionmargin is also clear (20mm-macroscopic).  One peribronchial lymph node shows reactive sinus histiocytosis with anthracosis but no evidence of malignancy. The subpleural scar contains dilated bronchioles consistent with broncioloectasis.Away from the tumour, apart from a focus of reactive type 2 metaplasia and scattered intraalveolar macrophages, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.

1322	 2562	 A.   Sections show liver tissue. The described nodule is circumscribed and surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. Within the nodule there are a few thin fibrous bands and the hepatic architecture is somewhat distorted.  There is some bile duct- like differentiation of hepatocytes at the edges of the fibrous bands but no definite true bile ducts are identified. The hepatocytes within the nodule have very mildly enlarged nuclei but the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is low. There is no significant nuclear atypia and no mitoses are identified.  A reticulin stain shows a fairly orderly reticulin pattern and no significant thickening of the hepatic plates.  A CD34 immunostain shows that much of the nodule is positive but there are patchy areas which fail to stain.  The appearances are considered to be most in keeping with a hepatic adenoma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  The slides have also been viewed by Prof D Rainone.	 DOCTOR:D Rainone
1322	 3308	 The liver elsewhere shows intact architecture. There are mild, patchy infiltrates of chronic inflammatory cells in the portal tracts.  There is no significant expansion of portal tracts and no fibrous bands are seen.  Bile ducts are normal. There is mild, patchy macrovesicular steatosis.  Central veinsare normal. Occasional PASD positive globules are identified within occasional hepatocytes but an Alpha-1-antitrypsin immunostain is interpreted as negative.  An Orcein stain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative. A rhodanine stainfor copper is negative. A perl stain for iron shows a mild patchy increase in iron staining of hepatocytes, grade 2+ out of 4. The changes in the liver away from the tumour are mild and are non-specific.	 PHI:Null

1332	 2408	 A.  The sentinel lymph node show several depositsof metastatic pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (E Cadherin negative) measuring up to 5.5mm in maximum dimension.  There are two foci of extranodal extension extending up to 0.4mm beyond the lymph node capsule over a front of 4mm. The deposit is CAM5.2 positive.	 PHI:Null
1332	 2821	 B. Sections show a 35mm grade 3 infiltrating mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma. The tumour is centred at 12 o'clock 20mm FN but invades around the large subareolar ducts of the nipple and reaches the dermis of the nipple. The latter comprises a 5.5mm contiguous expansion of tumour rather than a satellite nodule.  No skin ulceration, dermal lymphovascular invasion or Pagetoid epidermal involvement is seen.	 PHI:Null
1332	 3534	 Approximately 70%of the tumour shows classic lobular carcinoma morphology composed of moderately pleomorphic tumour cells arranged in solid nests and infiltrating cords.  About 20% of the lobular carcinoma component shows pleomorphic lobular carcinoma features. The latter cells display abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles, enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, vesicular chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli.   Approximately 30% of the carcinoma shows definite morphological ductal differentiation and these areas are both separate and intermingle with the lobular component (Block B1).  Interestingly the E Cadherin stain is negative in both the lobular and ductal components.	 PHI:Null
1332	 4528	 Only one (1) lymph node is identified  in the left lower axillary adipose tissue and (Block B16) it contains metastatic pleomorphic  lobular carcinoma 0.7mm on the H& E stained section but >2mm in a deeper level examined with AE/AE3 keratin immunostain.  There is a focus of extranodal extension 0.25mm beyond the lymph node capsule. The lymph node has a rather monotonous appearance with indistinct follicles and mostly a diffuse arrangement of small lymphocytes.  The sinuses appearpatent and there is possible focal extranodal extension of lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains indicate that most cells are CD3 and CD5 positive T cells, including the possible extranodal component. The T cells infiltrate atreticfollicles which are seen through the node, the latter marked by CD21, CD23, CD10 and CD20.  The bcl2 immunostain corresponds to the T cell component with no definite coexpression by CD20 positive B cells.  Cyclin D1 is negative.  The appearances are interpreted as reactive.	 PHI:Null

1334	 4172	 The nodule is a minimally invasive well differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  The differential is between a minimally invasive (capsule only) follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, the distinction depending on the interpretation of the nuclear features.  Despite the presence of dense colloid and peripheral scalloping,in my opinion the nuclear features both qualitatively and quantitatively fall short of definite papillary carcinoma and I favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma.  Immunohistochemistry is unhelpful in this distinction as boththe tumour cells and background benign follicles stain diffusely with CK19.  Lack of vascular invasion in minimally invasive follicular carcinomas portends a very good prognosis with predicted behaviour akin to a diagnosis of follicularadenoma.  .

1334	 6574	 Reported by A/Prof L Yessios	 DOCTOR:L Yessios
1334	 7085	 Firstly I agree that the 12mm tumour in the right lobe is a definite papillary carcinoma. Definite metastatic carcinoma is present in one of four perithyroidal nodes adjacent to the right lobe.  In the central neck dissection one node containing psammoma bodies is present (in the presence of a definite papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, I would normally classify this node as being involved by carcinoma). Therefore metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma is present in 2 of 10 lymph nodes from the thyroid.	 PHI:Null
1334	 7570	 The 8mm lesion in the left lobe is difficult to classify.  The issue in my mind is whether it is an adenoma or adenomatous nodule or a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion (both are almost always cured after excision alone).  Therefore in the setting of a patient with a definite 12mm papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right lobe (and 2 lymph node metastases) this distinction is essentially arbitrary and certainly of no clinical consequence.	 PHI:Null
1334	 7982	 Based on the paraffin slides I would have classified the 8mm lesion as an adenomatous nodule.  However in the frozen section side itself there is an area of capsular irregularity which at the time of frozen I would probably have classified as full thickness invasion.  On this basis I think it is best to classify the 8mm lesion as a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion.	 PHI:Null

The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm, is firm and slightly puckered posteriorly over an area of 25mm.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 3mm and the myometrium is 30mm in maximal dimension.  The myometrium contains five fibroids ranging from 3mm to 8mm in maximum diameter.  The fibroids show a smooth whorled surface.  The posterior body and cervix abuts the cream lobulated soft tumour.  The right fallopian tubeis not identified however a right ovary is partly adherent to the proximal bowel surgical margin and measures 30 x 20 x 20mm.  The left fallopian tube is 40mm in length x 10mm in greatest diameter.  The left ovary is buried underneath adherent tumour and measures 25 x 15 x 20mm.  There is a segment of bowel measuring 110mm in length x 30 x 20mm in diameter.  The distal margin is inked blue and the proximal margin is inked black.  The bowel serosa is adherent to the posterior body of the uterus and is circumferentially covered with omentum and tumour.  The mucosa of the bowel appears unremarkable.  The tumour measures approximately 110 x 75 x 35mm and abuts the posterior vaginal wall, abuts the segmentof bowel and adnexal structures of the uterus.

1348	 1312	 A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of a segment of sigmoid colon 110mm in length with mesenteric fatty tissue (110 x 80 x 25mm).  The entire mesenteric fatty tissue is peritonealised.  One resection margin is stapled.  The staples are removed and new margin is inked blue.  There is an indurated pink tumour measuring 36 x 20 x 10mm.  The tumour occupies 50% of the sigmoid colon circumference and has raised edges and a depressed centre.  The tumour is 13mm from the stapled margin and 60mm from the other margin.  The tumour extends from the mesenteric to the antimesenteric side.  There appears to be focal extension of tumour into fattytissue (block 5).  Separate from the main specimen there is a pouch shaped piece of colorectal mucosa with surrounding fatty tissue measuring 27 x 22 x 10mm.

1349	 1556	 Sections of distal pancreas show extensive hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets which in some areas replaces the pancreatic parenchyma in a peripheral "ring like" fashion.  Residual benign ducts and occasional pancreatic acini are noted within the areas of hyperplasia.	 PHI:Null
1349	 1685	 Elsewhere in the distal pancreas the hyperplastic islets have a more random distribution throughout the pancreatic parenchyma.	 PHI:Null
1349	 1809	 The hyperplastic islets are associated with amyloid deposition which is confirmed in Congo Red and Crystal Violet stains.	 PHI:Null
1349	 1916	 The hyperplastic islets, includingareas where they focally coalesce, show no significant nuclear atypia.	 PHI:Null
1349	 2197	 Immunohystochemistry shows a marked predominance of insulin staining cells within the hyperplastic islets, accounting for approximately 80% of the cell population.

1349	 2258	 Ki67 expression is low, staining approximately 1% of cells.	 PHI:Null
1349	 2443	 The exocrine pancreatic acini and ducts show no significant morphological abnormality.  Occasional pancreatic ducts show mild hyperplasia associated mild atypia, suggestive of PanIN-1.	 PHI:Null
1349	 2504	 The sections of omentum reveal a single benign lymph node.	 PHI:Null

1349	 3024	 Comment:  The overall appearances would favour a diagnosis of pronouncedislet cell hyperplasia rather than a pancreatic endocrine neoplasm.  The distribution of the hyperplastic islets and the admixture of glucagon and insulin staining cells would support this interpretation.	 PHI:Null

A total of twenty-five polyps have been identified in the extended right colon and all of these polyps are either tubular adenomas or tubulovillous adenomas.  The larger polyps are tubulovillous adenomas which tend to be pedunculated.  The degree of dysplasia is generally low grade with one focus of high grade dysplasia.  All of the polyps have been totally blocked and no invasive carcinoma is identified.  The ileal and colonic resection margins appear normal and the colonic mucosa away from the polyps shows no abnormality.

1386	 2987	 The left retroperitoneal mass is an (intra)vascular leiomyosarcoma. The sarcoma is moderately cellular and is composed of sheets of moderately to highly pleomorphic spindled cells arranged in tight, intersecting fascicles. There is heterogeneity of atypia the tumour, with discrete zones of moderate through to high grade sarcoma present. There are up to 25 mitoses per 10 high power fields, including numerous atypical forms. There are scattered foci of necrosis.	 PHI:Null
1386	 3805	 The leiomyosarcoma appears to arise from the wall of a vessel. The sarcoma extends along andcompresses the vessel lumen, which has been highlighted with endothelial markers (CD34 and CD31). Although the sarcoma appears circumscribed in areas, and is largely surrounded by the fibrous vessel wall and perivascular fibroadipose tissue, focally, lobules of high grade sarcoma infiltrate into the adjacent perivascular tissues. The margins are detailed below. The tumour directly abuts, but does not infiltrate, the overlying adrenal gland. Four peritumoral lymph nodesshowing reactive changes are present (0/4). The kidney shows patchy nephrosclerosis, hypertensive vasculopathy and focal nephrocalcinosis. The ureteric and renal vascular margins appear free of tumour. The renal hilum shows no significant abnormality.	 PHI:Null

1386	 5006	 The left retroperitoneal tumour is a FNCLCC Grade 3 (intra)vascular leiomyosarcoma. The sarcoma appears to arise from the wall of a vessel, expanding the lumen and invading into perivascular fibroadipose tissue. The sarcoma shows strong SMA and Desmin positivity and although strong CD34 positivity is unusual, this has been previously described in leiomyosarcomas. The sarcoma is present focally at the posterior and medial margins and is close to remaining margins.	 PHI:Null

1398	 2030	 Sections show a high grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm, which is highly cellular with marked cytological and nuclear pleomorphism.  These cells areadmixed with bizarre tumour giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells.  A storiform pattern and myxoid changes are focally present.  There are large areas of tumour necrosis.  No low grade or well differentiated areas are seen.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for CD34.  The stains for CD117, MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin), SMA, Desmin and S-100 are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is 15%.  The overall appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma).  Because of the positive stain for CD34, the possibility of malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumour cannot be excluded.  The overlying colonic mucosa is unremarkable.

Many of the nuclei have one or more small nucleoli.  There are occasional ribbons of cells but no gland formation or other definite differentiating features are seen.  There is prominent, patchy tumour necrosis and mitoses are frequent.  Tumour is seen extensively infiltrating residual normal pancreas and also invades intoextra-pancreatic fat and other soft tissue.  Lymphovascular invasion by tumour is identified at least focally.

Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of ileum measuring 85mm inlength x 20mm in maximum diameter adjoined to the caecum and ascending colon measuring 270mm in length x 45mm in maximum dimension.  There is no attached appendix.  The bowel mesentery wraps around the caecum and ileocaecal valve area.The serosa elsewhere appears smooth and shiny.  On opening there is a necrotic circumferential exophytic tan tumour measuring 90 x 60 x 65mm which is located in the distal caecum adjacent to and invading through the ileocaecal valve.Tumour invades through the bowel wall into subserosal tissue.  The tumour is 65mm from the proximal surgical margin (ileum) and 190mm from the distal surgical margin (ascending colon).  Elsewhere the ascending colon has two polyps, one 5mmin maximum dimension, 75mm from the distal surgical margin and the other 7mm in maximum dimension, 96mm from the distal surgical margin.	 PHI:Null

1415	 472	 MACROSCOPIC:	 PHI:Null
1415	 1396	 Specimen labelled "Extended hemicolectomy with partial stomach and partial liver" consists of a segment of small and large bowel (450mm long), mesenteric fat (up to 110mm across), an adherent part of stomach (70mm in length, and an adherent part of liver (80 x 30 x 27mm).  The adherent stomach is 50mm from the closer colonic cut end.  The hepatic resection margin is inked green after removing the staples.  There is an indurated tumour involving the wall of the large bowel 73mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour infiltrates through the mesenteric fat and appears to be abutting the serosa and theadherent wall of stomach.  It is 70mm from the closer colonic resection margin and well clear of the opposite resection margin.  The lumen of the colon is narrowed but is not occluded.  The gastric mucosa appears grossly normal.  The tumour is circumferential and shows mucoid areas in approximately 80% of the cut surface.	 PHI:Null

1415	 2787	 Sections show a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon.  Adenocarcinoma penetrates the visceral peritoneum of the transverse colon (Block 25) which in areas, is associated with the formation of inflamed fibrous adhesion, resulting in the attachment of part of the stomach and liver to the transverse colon.  Adenocarcinoma is not present in the adhesion and does not involve the adherent stomach or liver.  A synoptic report follows.	 PHI:Null

1425	 1843	 The entire specimen is embedded and examined.  Sections show a 10mm adenocarcinoma arising within a 70mm tubulovillous adenoma with low and high grade dysplasia (the latter comprising approximately 30% of the adenoma). The carcinoma is mainly intramucosal, however, there is focal extension into the superficial submucosa associated with stromal desmoplasia.  Assessment of submucosal extension is difficult due to loss of the muscularis mucosae in this area (highlighted with a desmin immunostain), however, the contour of the tumour extends below the adjacent muscularis mucosa and tumour nests are present immediately adjacent to medium sized vessels consistent with submucosal invasion.

1437	 3403	 A.  The entire right lobe has been embedded and examined. The 40mm nodule is a circumscribed, unencapsulated, hyperplastic nodule with a microfollicular and solid nested architecture.  The nodule is composed of follicular epithelial cells showing mild atypia with nuclear enlargement, scattered nuclear grooves and some loss of polarity, however, the features are insufficient for a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma. There are areas of central hyaline fibrosis and possible ischaemic type infarction with possible cell ghosts and dystrophic calcification.  No significant mitotic activity or nuclear convolutions are seen. Immunostains demonstrate thyroglobulin expression and negative staining for calcitonin, chromogranin and CEA. There is also anincidental unencapsulated focus of papillary microcarcinoma (A12), distributed across 1.8mm with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The papillary microcarcinoma is 3.5mm clear of the clearest (posterior/tracheal) resection margin.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. Away from the dominant nodule the thyroid shows scattered unencapsulated smallfollicular nodules containing macrofollicles and mild lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centre formation. Some perithyroidal arteries show calcification of the internal elastic lamina.  One (1) normal parathyroid gland is also present.	 PHI:Null

1441	 1319	 A.  Specimen labelled "Left breast" consists of an unorientated,  irregular breast 270 x 250mm to a depth of 130mm. Skeletal muscle forms the deep margin of the specimen in some areas.  There is a large fungating ulcerated tumour measuring 220 x 170mm which has destroyed and replaced the nipple areolar complex and the majority of the surrounding skin; ulcerated tumour is 10mm from the closest radial cutaneous margins skin margin.  Sectioning reveals a poorly circumscribed cream tumour with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour invades the skeletal muscle and appears to abut the deep margin in several areas.   The tumour appears to extend to the superficial margin and the radial resection margins.	 PHI:Null
1441	 1501	 Blocks:  1 - tumour to deep margin; 2- tumour to skin; 3 to 5 - further representative tumour; 6 - tumour to skin radial margin; 7 to 14 - further representative tumour and margins.	 PHI:Null
1441	 2052	 B.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary contents" consists of an unoriented, irregular piece of tan and fatty tissue,  95 x 80 x 45mm.  The cut surface reveals multiple lymph nodes, many of which are replaced by cream tumour. The largest involved lymph node measures 55mm in maximum dimension.  An estimated twenty lymph nodes are identified, however, the exact count is difficult to assess as many of the lymph nodes are matted together by tumour. The tumour appears to abut the resection margin of the specimen.  Representative sections in 8 blocks.	 PHI:Null

1441	 3290	 A & B.  Sections show a 220mm, fungating, ulcerated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is arranged in dissecting sheets and solid nests with associated stromal desmoplasia and extensive necrosis.  No well formed tubules are seen.  The carcinoma extensively ulcerates skin, destroying the nipple areolar complex, replaces much of the breast tissue and infiltrates skeletal muscle reaching the deep margin. The mitotically active tumour cells have large pleomorphic nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, vesicular chromatin and eosinophilic macronucleoli. Although in areas the tumour has asquamoid appearance, no intercellular prickles or keratinisation indicative of squamous differentiation are seen, and dPAS stains highlight scattered glandular lumina both betweenand within cells consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The small amount of sampled residual breast lobules show no evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).   Numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen within the dermis (A2), breast and extranodal tissue of the axilla. The tumour extends to the superficial, radial and deep resection margins.	 PHI:Null
1441	 3677	 Approximately seventeen of twenty one (17/21) axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with similar appearances to the breast tumour.  There is extensive extranodal involvement including infiltration of axillary skeletal muscle, mainly via extensive extranodal lymphatic spread. The carcinoma extends to the resection margin of the axillary specimen.	 PHI:Null

1441	 5788	 A lung primary was suggested as the site of origin of the previously sampled left axillary metastasis based on the reported immunoprofile (80V36805 - CK7 positive, CK20 positive, TTF1 positive, ER negative).  The previously sampled left breast tumour (80V36805), in a more limited sample, was CK7 positive, TTF1 minimally positive, CK20 positive, ER positive (approximately 30% predominantly moderate intensity) and PR negative.  The current breast tumour specimen and axillary metastasis show similar positive immunoexpression for CK7, CK20 and TTF1.  The ER results in the current specimens are conflicting; the breast tumour is ER negative (tested twice with appropriate controls) and the axillary metastases ER positive.  Another marker for lung adenocarcinoma, Napsin A, is negative in both the breast tumour and axillary metastases, although poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma may lose expression.  In view of the advanced nature of the breast tumour, axillary location of metastases,and despite the lack of an identifiable in-situ component (the tumour has replaced much of the breast tissue), a breast primary (grade 3 ductal, NST) with axillary metastasis seemsmuch more likely than origin from a lung adenocarcinoma.  The TTF1 and CK20 results are interpreted as aberrant.  TTF 1 expression by breast carcinomas is very rare but has been reported with clone SPT24 used in this case.  Correlation with the clinical and radiological features is advised.	 IDNUM:80V36805

1445	 9088	 The segment of ureter and a small amount of bladder wall have been identified in thefurther sections.  The proximal margin of the ureter is free of tumour (block 56).  Around 4mm more distally there is tumour in soft tissue around the ureter (block 57) and further distally there is tumour surrounding the ureter and extending into the ureter wall, almost reaching the mucosa (60-63).  The point of entry of the ureter into the bladder is identified (64) and the bladder mucosa and muscle layer immediately adjacent to this is free of tumour.  However there is tumour, probably in a vessel, just outside the bladder wall and very close to the apparent bladder excision margin, in this region (block 64).	 PHI:Null

1499	 1501	 A.  Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left arm, short superior, longlateral, double radial head, loop olecranon" consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 160 x 100mm to a depth of 30mm.  There are four marking sutures in situ as described (orientated by Dr Elias ZABAWA, surgical registrar).  The deep margin includes skeletal muscle and fascia. The deep surfaces reveals a tumour which appears to be composed of two nodules.  Located closest to the superior margin is an exposed nodule in which the overlying fascia has been surgically divided. This nodule measures 45 x 40mm and is located 12mm from the medial margin and 40mm from the superior margin. There is a second nodule which is palpable beneath the skeletal muscle margin measuring 55 x 55mm and is located 4mm from the medial margin and 25mm from the inferior margin.  The lateral marginis inked blue, medial margin black, exposed tumour face inked yellow, radial head inked red and olecranoninked green.	 DOCTOR:Elias ZABAWA
1499	 1988	 On sectioning the tumour appears well clear of the superficial margin (>50mm) and well clear of the lateral margin (> 30mm). The tumour appears to abut the medial margin.  Nodules one and two appear to be a continuous single tumour.  The tumour is approximately 35% myxoid (slices five to slices eight), 30% solid and fleshy (slices 9-11) and 35% soft cream and necrotic (slices 12-16).  The radial head margin is located in slices 8-10, the olecranon margin is located in slices 7-11.	 PHI:Null

1499	 2885	 MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Vanalstin)	 DOCTOR:C Vanalsti
1499	 4481	 The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sectionsshow a pleomorphic high grade undifferentiated sarcoma nearing approximately 95mm in maximum dimension. The tumour is centred within the deep subcutis, penetrates fascia and infiltrates skeletal muscle (eg block 27) in several areas. Thedermis is uninvolved.  The tumour has a partly infiltrative and partly circumscribed profile with relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma and more cellular areasdisplaying storiform or fascicular growth within a fibrous stroma.  The tumour is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and epithelioid cells within a variably fibrous or myxoid stroma. There are capillary sizedvessels, some of which are thick walled.  There are numerous admixed tumour giant cells with hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, many of which have intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic macronuclei.  In some areas the tumour cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm imparting a rhabdoid-like appearance.   The adipose tissue away from the advancing front of tumour is mature with no significant variation in size and no lipoblasts identified.  The morphological appearances are similar to those of the previous core biopsy (15W55938), in which no specific line of differentiation was identified (Negative for S100, HMB45, MelanA, PANCK, AE1/AE3, SMA, Desmin).  Myogenin immunostaining is also negative. Thetumour remains mitotically active (4 per 10 HPF).  There is minimal response to therapy with only minimal necrosis (block 37) and focal areas of acute and subacute haemorrhage.	 IDNUM:15W55938

1508	 3015	 A.  Sections show skin, parotid gland and underlying soft tissue containing a small amount of skeletal muscle towardsone longitudinal margin. The tumour is an ulcerated moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating from epidermis.  The carcinoma replaces the skin, subcutis and directly invadesthe underlying parotid gland and is about 22mm thick.  The tumour has a partly circumscribed and partly infiltrative profile and is mainly composed of nests and sheets of moderate to highly pleomorphic epithelioid and spindled squamous cells which show areas of keratinisation.  In some superficial areas the tumour has a discohesive pseudovascular appearance.  Foci of tumour necrosis are present. There are several entrapped nerves ofvarying sizes, however, no outlying foci of perineural invasion are seen.  Several moderate sized nerves towards one longitudinal margin and close to skeletal muscle are uninvolved.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. The tumour is 0.3mm from longitudinal margin, deep to striated muscle and above the level of the parotid (A9 AE1/AE3).  The tumour is 0.7m from a diathermied cleft close to one transverse margin (A6), however, the margin regarded as the true transverse margin is about 1.7mm clear.  The deep margin is 3mm clear.  One (1) lymph node at one longitudinal end is directly invaded by squamous cell carcinoma (A9).  There are some adjacent foci of actinic keratosis.  The parotid gland shows minor atrophy and is chronically inflamed.	 PHI:Null

1536	 3823	 Sections of the left axillary lesion show an undifferentiated FNCLCC Grade 3 pleomorphic sarcoma (pleomorphic MFH). The sarcoma is composed of malignant epithelioid to spindle cells arranged in highly cellular infiltrative lobules and sheets. The malignant cells have highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, variably prominent rhabdoid eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent cherry-pink nucleoli. Scattered bizarre bi and multinucleated tumour cells are also present. In areas, the tumour cells are separated by variably thick hyalinised fibrocollagenous-type septae. The sarcoma shows brisk mitotic active, with over 70 mitoses per 10 hpf, including abundant atypical mitoses. Focal lymphovascular space and perineural invasion are seen (block 1). There are broad areas of serpiginous, suppurative necrosis throughout the entire tumour (involving >50% - ?treatment related). No cytoplasmic pigment, malignant osteoid or chondroid differentiation is identified. The overlying skin shows reactive change and an organising dermocutaneous abscess, possibly related to previous surgery. At the deep and peripheral aspects, the sarcoma is surrounded by a variably thick cuff of mature fibroadipose tissue and portions of skeletal muscle, with areas of fat necrosis and a patchy myofibroblastic proliferation. A single epithelioid granuloma is present within the skeletal muscle (stains for organisms are negative). Sections through the axillary vein margin show numerous medium sized vessels, as well as, variably dense fibrocollagenous tissue. A small amount of lymphoid tissue is present at the edge of the tumour focally, and may represent an effaced lymph node. Two intact lymph nodes are also present in the surrounding fat, both of which show mild reactive changes.	 PHI:Null

1538	 4074	 No lymphovascular invasion is seen.	 PHI:Null
1538	 4200	 The ends of the excision are clear of tumour and no definite involvement of the peritoneal surface is seen in these sections.	 PHI:Null
1538	 4285	 The diverticulum is confirmed histologically and shows no inflammation or dysplasia.	 PHI:Null
1538	 4365	 10 lymph nodes are identified, none ofwhich show evidence of malignancy (0/10).	 PHI:Null
1538	 4422	 B. The sections of bowel show no evidence of malignancy.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5037	 C. The sections of liver show a circumscribed tumour matching the 30mm lesion described macroscopically.  The tumour is composed of large, atypical eosinophilic cells displaying gland formation and occasional intracytoplasmic acini.  In some areas the tumour cells grow in a sheet-like and focally trabecular pattern.  The cells contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional eosinophilic globules are noted within the cytoplasm of some cells.  The nuclei show moderate to marked nuclear atypia with variably prominent nucleoli. Occasional tumour cells contain intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudo inclusions.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5115	 No squamous differentiation, melanin pigment or bile pigment is identified.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5289	 The Diastase stain shows positive staining of gland lining and also mucin vacuoles within individual cells.These changes are consistent with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5381	 The centre of the tumour shows organising fibrosis with entrapped vessels and bile ducts.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5520	 The tumour cells show strong positive staining for Keratin 7 and Keratin 19.   CD20 shows patchy positive staining but CDX2 is negative.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5730	 The tumour cells are also negative for hepatocystic markers (Hepar-1, Alpha fetoprotein).  Alpha 1 antitrypsin shows diffuse positivity within the liver and also within the tumour, of uncertain significance.	 PHI:Null
1538	 5880	 The tumour cells show patchy positive staining with CEA.  CD34 stains blood vessels within the tumour nodule and also in surrounding portal tracts.	 PHI:Null

1538	 6011	 Prostatic specific antigens and TTF1 are both negative.	 PHI:Null
1538	 6598	 liver immediately surrounding the tumour deposit shows mild fatty change.  The portal tracts are variably expanded by proliferating bile ductules and a mixed, predominately chronic, inflammatory cells infiltrate.  Chronic inflammatory cells are also noted within the hepatic lobules.  No bile lakes are seen but there is mild sinusoidal dilatation.  These changes may reflect local obstructive or reactive changes due to the presence of a tumour nodule.  Elsewhere the liver is non cirrhotic and shows mild steatosis and a mild increase in inflammatory cells within the portal tracts.	 PHI:Null
1538	 6687	 The tumour is clear of the surgical margin in the region of the porta hepatis by 10mm.	 PHI:Null
1538	 7363	 The morphological and Immunohistochemical appearances of the tumour in the liver are distinctly different to those seen in the small bowel tumour.  This would support the theory that these represent two separate neoplastic processes.  Neither tumour is particularly typical of colorectal carcinoma however a signet ring morphology is sometimes seen in colorectal carcinomas and therefore the smallbowel tumour may still represent a metastasis from that site.  The morphology of the liver tumour however is more suggestive of either a primary cholangiocarcinoma in the liver or metastatic carcinoma from an upper gastrointestinal siteor possibly a pancreaticobiliary origin.

1548	 3562	 Approximately 90% of the 250mm tumour is well differentiated liposarcoma.  The remaining 10% (one of the demarcated nodules described grossly) comprises grade de-differentiated liposarcoma, 90mm in maximum dimension and present inferiorly within the specimen.  The second well demarcated myxoid nodule, at the superior end of the specimen comprises well differentiated liposarcoma with sclerosing and myxoid areas. The well differentiated areas shows lipoma-like, sclerosing and inflammatory morphology.  There are interspersed areas with myxoid stromal alteration and non-plexiform capillary like vasculature.  Well differentiated liposarcoma encases the rightadrenal gland and right kidney and extends into the renal hilum merging with renal hilar fat. The inferiorly located dedifferentiated nodule is composed of moderately cellular tumour composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindle and stellate cells, as well as, scattered bizarre multinucleated giant cells. Mitoses are easily identified.  No necrosis is seen.  No heterologous differentiation is seen.	 PHI:Null

The caecum and ascending colon are 90mm in length x 60 x 30mm in maximum dimension.  The serosa surrounding the appendix is dull and congested, elsewhere the serosa appears normal.  The appendix is 65mm in length and 10 x 8mm in maximum dimension and there is attached mesoappendix up to 70mm wide.  In the distal appendix there is a mucinous mass; this measures 25mm longby 15mm wide and is 30mm from the proximal end of the appendix at the closest point.  The mucinous mass appears to involve the full thickness of the appendix wall and appears to extend directly into the attached mesoappendix.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the mesocolon..

1553	 2201	 The whole appendix has been blocked.  Sections of the abnormal area show distensionof the appendix by mucus, with associated marked attenuation of some of the appendix wall.  Mucus tracks into part of the appendix wall, almost reaching the subserosal fat.  No mucus is seenextending into mesenteric fat or to the serosal surface.  The mucus in the appendix lumen is partly calcified.	 PHI:Null
1553	 2659	 In the abnormal area the appendiceal mucosa is replaced by abnormal mucinous epithelium.  This shows low grade dysplasia with nuclear enlargement and variable crowding.  Some of the abnormal mucosa also has featuresof a sessile serrated adenoma.  Focally there is some abnormal epithelium, associated with mucus which has dissected into the inner appendix wall.  No abnormal epithelium is seen extending through the wall and no invasive carcinoma is seen.	 PHI:Null
1553	 2996	 The features are of low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  If mucus with associated abnormal epithelium has previously escaped into the peritoneal cavity then there is some risk of the later development of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  However, on the basis of the evidence in this specimen, the risk in this case would seem to be low.	 PHI:Null

1555	 1949	 MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr P Lacer)	 DOCTOR:P Lacer
1555	 2967	 A - C.  Specimens A, B and C show similar histopathological features. The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal lesions are mildly cellular myxoid tumours composed of bland to stellate cells, within a predominantly myxoid stroma. Very occasional cells show very mild nuclear enlargement, nuclear inclusions and hyperchromasia. Scattered thin fibrous septae, as wellas, acellular mucin lakes and ganglion-like cysts, are present. There are also numerous small thin walled blood vessels, but no "chicken-wire" or "curvilinear" vessels are identified. There is no significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumours are partially surrounded by a fibrous pseudo-capsule, as well as, a cuff of focally atrophic skeletal muscle and mature fibroadipose tissue. Focally, myxoid tumour dissects between skeletal muscle fibres and adipocytes and is present at the inked surgical margins. Nolipoblasts are identified. The sections of deep margin of left thigh contain myxoid tumour which extends widely to the surgical margin.	 PHI:Null
1555	 2976	 COMMENT:	 PHI:Null
1555	 3217	 The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal (psoas) lesions are myxoid lesions with morphologic features consistent with intramuscular mxyoma(s). Theappearance is similar to that of the previously described left groin/thigh myxoma (50V95819).	 IDNUM:50V95819
1555	 3707	 Local recurrence of intramuscular myxomas is unusual and raises the pathologic differential diagnosis of a low grade myxoid sarcoma, such as: low grade fibromyxoid tumour and myxoid liposarcoma. However, the overall morphology, including low cellularity, absence of lipoblasts and curvilinear/chicken wire vessels, makes these differentials less likely. However, if requested, FISH testing could help to exclude a low grade sarcoma (FUS - fibromyxoid sarcoma; DDIT3 - myxoid liposarcoma).	 PHI:Null
1555	 3752	 There is no evidence of high grade sarcoma.	 PHI:Null

1557	 4941	 A.  Sections show  a poorly differentiated carcinoma of cervix with areas of well formed glands, areas with a glassy cell carcinoma-like appearance, and also very focal squamous differentiation.  The tumour consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei, often a single prominent nucleolus and a moderate amount of amphophilic or pale cytoplasm.  There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate, consisting mainly of eosinophils but also with some lymphocytes and plasma cells, within and around the tumour.  The tumour is considered to be best classified as a form of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma but with some glassy cell features.  It invades deeply into cervical stroma.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is11mm where total stromal thickness is 19mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  The ectocervical excision margin is well clear; the closest ectocervical margin is around 14mm.

1567	 4500	 Comment:	 PHI:Null
1567	 5289	 Immunohistochemistry of cancer tissues for mismatch repair proteins is a surrogate marker for MSI status, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result.  Tumours that show loss of MMR proteins are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI-H).   MSI in endometrial (and colorectal) cancer results from defective DNA MMR, either due to germline-inactivating DNA MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome patients), or epigenetic inactivation of the MLH1 gene by promoterhypermethylation (sporadic tumors).   Approximately 20% to 30% of endometrial carcinomas have microsatellite instability, and an epigenetic (sporadic) cause of MSI is more common than Lynch syndrome.  Correlation with family history and other findings recommended.	 PHI:Null

1584	 4256	 A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spreadbeyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade). This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.  Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnettseries for this intermediate group.	 PHI:Null
1584	 4787	 This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin. From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion presentin one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically. The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similar to the smallatypical focus in the appendix. Clinical correlation recommended.	 DATE:19/12/2060=>2060-12-19

1625	 3618	 A.  The 45mm right kidney tumour is a conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The carcinoma has alobulated appearance and is composed of sheets and nodules of carcinoma cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. The tumour cellsare arranged in solid and trabecular patterns and are surrounded by a prominent anastomosing network of blood vessels. Although the nuclei show predominantly Fuhrman grade 3 features, in areas, there is spindle cell (sarcomatoid) change, consistent with an overall Fuhrman grade 4tumour. At the superior pole of the kidney, carcinoma infiltrates through the renal capsule into perinephric adipose tissue and is seen 0.3mm from the inked perinephric fat margin. Focally, carcinoma extends beyond the perinephric fat and into a cuff of overlying partially adherent liver tissue. Tumour within the liver tissue appears clear of the surrounding inked hepatic surgical margins (>5.5mm).	 PHI:Null
1625	 4085	 At the hilum, tumour nodules abut hilar fat. Tumour is present within the lumen of the renal vein and appears partially incorporated into the renal vein wall. Tumour is not present in the section of the renal vein margin, renal artery margin or ureteric margin. The adjacent non-neoplastic renal parenchymashows patchy glomerulosclerosis and mild chronic inflammation. The adrenal gland appears within normal histologic limits and shows no involvement by carcinoma.	 PHI:Null

The tumour consists of lobules and ribbons of stratified squamous epithelium which focally includes a few mucin containing goblet cells.  The squamous epithelium sits on a loose fibrous stroma.  Within the sheets and lobules of epithelium there are loose reticular areas consistent with stellate reticulum.  Some palisading is seen at the base of the epithelium but this is not particularly prominent.  There is focal calcification.  Some pieces of tumour have a somewhat papillary architecture.  There is no necrosis and there is no cytologic atypia or evidence of malignancy.  There is a moderate, patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells in part of the stroma.

1702	 3116	 There are several features which do not fit for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma in this case, including the lack of wet keratin, the only focal calcification, the demonstration of some mucous containing goblet cells, and the lack of a surrounding xanthomatous tissue reaction.  Also, there is no aberrant nuclear staining for beta catenin and there is now positive BRAF staining.	 DATE:now=>2065-07-30

1719	 3837	 A.  Histology shows a distended appendix with the mucosa replaced by relatively monotonous flattened columnar mucinous epithelium which shows some micropapillary tufting in places.  There is low grade cytological atypia and morphology is consistent with that of a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  Additionally, there are widespread deposits of abundant extracellular mucinous material over the serosal aspect of the appendix and also within the wall which shows fibrosis and loss of the muscularis propria in places.  Scattered within these mucinous pools are occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium.  No areas of high grade or frankly malignant invasive adenocarcinoma are seen.  At the proximal end of the appendix adjacent to the resection margin the mucosa appears more normal showing only minor hyperplastic changes with no significant atypia.	 PHI:Null
1719	 4096	 B.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with a littleskeletal muscle.  There are numerous deposits of extracellular mucin with occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium consistent with involvement by low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.	 PHI:Null

Histology shows deposits of mucinous tumour within the peritoneal tissue, over the serosa and within the stroma, predominantly of the left ovary, with small deposits also seen over the serosa of the left fallopian tube, right ovary, focally the serosa of the uterus, gallbladder and spleen.  In most of these areas, the cytology of the epithelium is predominantlylow grade, but within the left ovary there is moderate cytological atypia, more in keeping with intermediate grade mucinous tumour, although not frankly malignant high-grade adenocarcinoma.  Otherwise the endometrium of the uterus is atrophic with mild adenomyosis.  A small intramural leiomyoma is also seen.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.  A small focus of ectopic adrenal is also seen within the subserosal tissue adjacent to the left tube and ovary. The skin of the umbilicus is not involved	 PHI:Null

The resection margin is at least 20mm clear.  The tumour is compared to the previous resection specimens (caecal adenocarcinoma 45O73950) and (descending colon adenocarcinoma 45O73950) and shows similar morphological features and grade albeit with more conspicuous luminal necrosis.  The liver tumour is consistent with metastasis from a colonic primary.	 IDNUM:45O73950
1732	 2992	 The adjacent liver shows preservation of lobular architecture.  The portal tracts contain bile ducts and branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein in normal numbers.  There is a mild to focally moderate portal chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, mainly of lymphocytes.  Patchy neutrophils are also present but are likely surgical. There are very occasional foci of interface change.  The lobules show moderate macrovesicular steatosis, mild steatohepatitis and patchy mild pericentral and pericellular fibrosis.  No iron or copper deposition is seen on Perls or Rhodanine staining.  No dPAS positive globules are seen.	 PHI:Null

1753	 8619	 Comment:	 PHI:Null
1753	 9074	 Absence(loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.  In this case isolated loss of MSH6 protein expression may indicate the presence of an underlying isolated MSH6 mutation.  Further testing may be beneficial if clinically indicated advised.	 PHI:Null
1753	 9213	 Preserved nuclearstaining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	 PHI:Null

1809	 4524	 The p.Glyl 12Val (G12V) mutation was detected in exon 2 ofthe KRAS gene indicating that this patient will be insensitive to anti-EGFR therapies.	 PHI:Null
1809	 4550	 TEST DESCRIPTION/COMMENTS	 PHI:Null
1809	 4975	 Samples arc screened for mutations inexons 2, 3 and 4 of the KRAS gene and exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene. These exons contain the codona 12, 13, 59, 61. 117 and 146 that are frequently mutated in colorectal cancers. Mutations at these codons lead to constitutive activation of EGFR downstream pathways. Patients whose tumours have mutation in KRAS or NRAS are unlikely to benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR therapies.	 PHI:Null
1809	 5207	 Approximately 35-45% of metastatic colorectal tumours harbour a KR.4Smutation whilst up to 6% will have a mutation in the NRAS gene. The vast majority (~90%) of all RAS mutations occur at codon 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene.	 PHI:Null
1809	 5625	 Depending on sample quality, analysis is by Next Generation sequencing (massively parallel sequencing), Sanger sequencing, high resolution melt (HRM) analysis or pyrosequencing.

1811	 6236	 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION	 PHI:Null
1811	 7522	 1. As reported, the large- mass in the hepatic left lobe is metastatic neuroendocrine tumour.  Part of the tumour shows the usual morphology which is predominantly of acinar type but with some trabecular areas.  However, much of the tumour also contains a second component which comprises an abnormal stromal proliferation. The stromal proliferation is most cellular around acinar structures which instead of being back-to-back are separated by the stroma but form nodular aggregates or elongated trabecular aggregates of these acini.  Further away from the epithelial elements, the stroma becomes less cellular and in some areas more myxoid with cells becoming much more spindling.  In the most cellular areas, the stromal proliferation comprises round to oval nuclei with moderately abundant clear vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent (up to 5 per high power field) and there is some apoptosis.  No particular cytoplasmic differentiation is identified and no particular morphological evidence of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is seen.  This sarcomatous stroma appears to be confined to the nodule within the liver which appears reasonably well circumscribed.  Centrally within the nodule, there is quite extensive necrosis with cystic degeneration and some	 PHI:Null

1811	 8400	 The provided immunohistochemistry confirms the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour in the epithelial componentshowing a typical CK7 and CK20 negative cytokeratin profile and positive staining for chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron specific enolase.  There is diffuse positivity for CDX-2 and very focal positive staining of some neuroendocrine cells for both serotonin and somatostatin. TTF-1, insulin, glucagon and gastrin are negative.  There is no evidence staining of the stromal proliferation for cytokeratins (PanCK, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6) but there is diffuse staining of the stromal component for vimentin.  There is some positivity for smooth muscle actin but much of this appears related to proliferating blood vessels and there is a similar, although possibly more widespread staining for desmin.Myogenin is negative, as are S 100 and CD99.	 PHI:Null
1811	 9681	 Additional and repeat immunohistochemistry has been done at NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL. Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 show staining of the neuroendocrine component but no staining of the stromal component.  There is also totally negative staining for cytokeratins 5, 7 and 20, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12 and p63. Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase are strongly positive in the neuroendocrine component but show no staining of the stromal component.  CD56 at ORROROO CAMPUS is only weakly positive (?different clone of antibody).  There is very weak patchy positivity for S100.  Due to the very primitive nature of the stromal proliferation, germ cell markers were done. Alphafetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase and CD30 are negative.  CD117 is negative.  CD99 shows a weak non-specific pattern of staining.  Smooth muscle actin shows positivity in blood vessels only (a less marked reaction than the SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES stain) and desmin is essentially negative although there is some positivity in spindle cells in areas which appear degenerate and ischaemic, a finding that is difficult to interpret.  Mycogen is negative.  CD31and CD34 show a fine vascular network throughout the tumour only.	 HOSPITAL:NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL

1811	 9875	 Staining with somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) shows focal cytoplasmic and membrane positivity within the neuroendocrine component of the tumour although the reaction is fairly weak generally.	 PHI:Null
1811	 10154	 However, glucose transporter I (GLUTI) is negative.  Positive staining with (GLUTI relates to FDG positivity on PET while SSTR2 positivity relates toGaTate positivity on PET.

1811	 10725	 Ki-67 estimation using the ROSEBUD HOSPITAL stain is estimated at 22% on the neuroendocrine component.  This is counting a hot spot in block A9 with 153/693 cells being positive. There is no defined standard as to the number of cells counted with recommended numbers varying between 500 and 2000.  The tumour is therefore, technically grade 3, although just so.  It is possible that if a larger number of cells were counted, the count would be below 20%.  The Ki-67 of the stromal component varies considerably averaging about 50% but in some areas getting up to 70-80%.	 HOSPITAL:ROSEBUD HOSPITAL

1811	 11204	 COMMENT	 PHI:Null
1811	 11734	 The morphology of the stromal component in the large metastasis within the left lobe of liver is of high grade sarcoma, NOS.  It appears to be intimately involved with the neuroendocrine component of the tumour with it surrounding and separating the neuroendocrine components of the tumour where stroma is predominant within the nodule.  Mitotic rate is high and there is necrosis.  The sarcomatous stroma appears confined to the metastasis and is not seen in two other hepatic metastases or in the primary neuroendocrine tumour.	 PHI:Null
1811	 12138	 This is a distinctly unusual finding.  I have not seen this type of stromal proliferation in relation to any neuroendocrine tumours of gastroenteropancreatic type, nor can I find literature in relation to this whether relating to hepatic metastasis or primary pancreatic, gastric or enteric tumours of neuroendocrine type.  Tumours of this pattern have been described rarely in bladder, lung and thymus.	 PHI:Null
1811	 12630	 In both bladder and lung, this sort of sarcomatoid stroma is usually associated with high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, either small cell or large cell type. However, in the thymus, there are rare cases of lower grade neuroendocrine tumours (thymic carcinoid) with accompanying sarcomatous stroma.  A case is illustrated in the WHO Blue Book Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (2004), p 192-193.  The comment is made that these cases pursued a highly aggressive clinical course.	 PHI:Null
1811	 13208	 The terminology is confusing, depending on the organ system that is being addressed, but it would seem reasonable to regard the metastasis in the liver as having biphasic differentiation, possibly being called neuroendocrine carcinosarcoma or sarcomatoid neuroendocrine carcinoma.  This case may be worthy of a case report in that itis a distinctly unusual finding and the literature is silent.  As there is no literature, it is not possible to predict outcome but to my mind it would be likely be considerably less favourable than if the sarcomatoid component was not present.	 PHI:Null

1814	 4033	 A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour is moderately differentiated, comprising slit-like glands and some papillae lined by epithelial cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm.  However there is a significant proportion which consists of solid sheets and trabeculae of tumour cells so overall it is poorly differentiated.  The tumour involves the body and fundus of the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion measures 9.5mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium, some of which is well away from the main invasive tumour.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Two small leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, are noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries show several small simple cysts bilaterally.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.	 PHI:Null

1815	 4690	 Background:	 PHI:Null
1815	 5076	 HNPCC is most often caused by a heterozygous deleterious mutation within one of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2).  However, somatic hyper-methylation or constitutional epimutation of one of these genes can produce a similar phenotype.  Detection of methylation in the promoter region of one of these genes may be useful in determining the heritability of a cancer.	 PHI:Null
1815	 5083	 Method	 PHI:Null
1815	 5483	 Methylation testing is carried out on DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tumour tissue using a methylation-sensitive multiplex-ligation dependent probeamplification (MS-MLPA) technique.  Methylation-sensitive probes are protected from digestion when bound to the patient's methylated DNA and are subsequently amplified by PCR.  If the patient's DNA is not methylated a product will not beproduced.	 PHI:Null
1815	 5920	 This method targets methylation sites in the MLH1 promoter corresponding to regions A, B, C and D (Deng et al) and in intron I.  It has been shown that methylation at regions C and D correlates with reduced MLH1 expression, whereas methylation at other sites is non-specific (Capel et al).  The MS-MLPA method provides an estimation of the percentage methylation at each site with a result of greater than 10% considered to be positive.	 PHI:Null

1831	 3983	 A.  Sections of uterus show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma involves both the anterior and posterior uterine body and contiguously invades into the outer half of the myometrium, 8.5mm through myometrium 10mm  thick (block A9). The carcinoma invades the stroma of the lower segment (blocks A1 & A6) but does not reach the endocervix.  The carcinoma is composed of tumour cells with grade 3 nuclei and arranged in sheets, trabeculae and cords within a desmoplastic stroma.  Only minor abortive glandular differentiation  is present (grade 3architecture).  Focally, the carcinoma shows squamoid differentiation, however, no intercellular prickles or keratinization is seen (block A8).  No sarcomatoid features are seen.  There is focal in-situ endometrioid adenocarcinoma (block A11).  There are moderate areas of tumour necrosis, especially superficially.There are several foci of lymphovascular invasion just beyond the advancing front of tumour, in the outer half of the myometrium (block A8 & A11).  No outlying foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen.  The carcinoma is well clear (greater than 20mm) of the ectocervical margin.  The right and left fallopian tubes are uninvolved and, apart from prior tubal ligations noted grossly, are unremarkable.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.	 PHI:Null

1834	 1783	 The entire specimen has been embedded and examined.  Sections show a multinodular goitre.  The thyroid is composed of multiple hyperplastic nodules with a mixed microfollicular and macrofollicular architecture.  There are rare lymphoidaggregates and occasional nodules showing Hurthle cell change. There are areas of degenerative change with cystic formation, acute and subacute haemorrhage, fibrosis and dystrophic calcification.  Several of the nodules show variably defined investing fibrous capsules.	 PHI:Null
1834	 3650	 Arising within an unencapsulated mainly follicular-patterned nodule (Blocks 22-25), approximately 20mm in maximum dimension, is a multifocal papillary carcinoma with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The side of the nodule is unclear as the specimen is received unoriented.  The exact dimensions of the carcinomatous component is difficult to determine as the carcinoma transitions to, and is intermingled with,follicles showing a spectrum of variable nuclear atypia, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma, as well as benign follicles.  The atypical nuclear features include variable nuclear enlargement, nuclear pallor, patchy mild crowding, patchy irregularity and occasional grooves.  Some atypical follicles also contain hypereosinophilic colloid.  The whole nodule shows abrupt transition to adjacent follicles lined by low cuboidal bland epithelium. In contrast to the atypical follicles, the foci of convincing papillary carcinoma show distinct nuclear features of papillary carcinoma including rare intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions and include foci with papilliform architecture.  A 1.2mm focus of papillary carcinoma arranged in follicles is also present immediately adjacent to the 20mm nodule (Block 22).  With immunostains CK19 highlights foci with more pronounced nuclear atypia including diffuse staining of the definite carcinomatous foci, while HBME1 shows more widespread but non-diffuse staining of the 20mm nodule. No lymphovascular invasion is seen.   The clearance is difficult to assess as follicles with nuclear crush artefact, continuous with the 20mm nodule,focally abut the disrupted margin of resection (23, 23L2). Elsewhere the nodule is separated from the margin by the thin fibrous pseudocapsule of the lobe, <0.1mm clear( 24).  One normal parathyroid gland is also present. No perithyroidlymph nodes are seen.	 PHI:Null
1834	 3659	 COMMENT:	 PHI:Null
1834	 4265	 Arising within a 20mm mainly follicular patterned nodule are multiple foci of papillary carcinoma.  Approximately 30% of the nodule shows definite nuclear features of carcinoma. Within theremainder of the nodule a substantial proportion of follicles display atypical nuclear features, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma; these foci may represent follicular hyperplasia with nuclear atypia. Consensus amongst pathologists is lacking as to how to determine the maximum size of the carcinomatous component in these circumstances, although some may regard the entire 20mm nodule as carcinomatous.

1842	 952	 Sections show a punchbiopsy of skin including epidermis and dermis.  The epidermis shows patchy parakeratosis and moderate spongiosis with focal early vesicle formation.  Neutrophils are present in the stratum corneum focally, suggesting excoriation.  The superficial dermis is oedematous and has a mild and moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.  There are also scattered interstitial eosinophils in the superficial dermis.  Focal red cell extravasation is noted in the superficial dermis and extending into the epidermis.  There is no vasculitis.	 PHI:Null

1851	 2418	 The 280mm intra-abdominal lesion is a mesenteric fibromatosis. The fibromatosis is unencapsulated and appears largely circumscribed. The tumour is composed of bland to plump spindled cells with normochromic nucleiand pin-point nucleoli. The cells are arranged in loose fascicles within focally fibromyxoid stroma, with scattered intercellular aggregates of dense keloidal-type collagen and focally telangiectatic vessels. Scattered foci of extravasated red blood cells are seen. There is no significant cytologic atypia, significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumour abuts the muscularis propria of the overlying adherent segment of small bowel, which appears otherwise unremarkable.

Roughly in the middle of the segment there is a roughened adhesion like area on the antimesenteric serosal surface measuring 40 x 30mm (inked blue).  Slicing through this area reveals a circumferential solid tumour measuring 55 x 35 x 35mm.  The tumour has pale and yellow cut surfaces.  The tumour extends to the roughened antimesenteric serosalarea and into the mesenteric fatty tissue.  The tumour is 35mm from mesenteric resection margin and 65 and 55mm from colonic resection margin.   The lumen within the tumour is narrowed down to 4mm in diameter.  There is a sessile polyp5mm in maximum dimension, 15mm from one of the colonic resection margins.  The mesenteric resection margin is inked black.  There are two solid adjacent nodules measuring 16 and 10mm in maximum dimension abutting the mesenteric resectionmargin.

1907	 3703	 At the request of Dr X Dirago the margins of excision of specimen C (retroperitoneal tumour) are assessed.  The specimenwas received unoriented and was not inked grossly making assessment of margins difficult, however, in areas there is peripheral diathermy artefact or a surface layer of red blood cells consistent with the line of excision.  In an area where the specimen appears disrupted the tumour appears to reach the diathermy line over a front of about 4mm and completeness of excision is therefore regarded as doubtful (Block C3 & C4).

The tumour has a mixed papillary, alveolar and nested architecture with large areas of haemorrhage. The cells are large and polygonal with abundant clear to granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with patchy intracytoplasmic Schmorls positive melanin. The nuclei are central to eccentrically located with coarse to vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  There are also occasional cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and/or multiple nuclei, prominent macronucleoli, consistent with Fuhrmann and ISUP grade 4. In some areas there are vaguely nodular areas of smaller cells surrounded by areas of larger more pleomorphic cells.  Rare foci of psammomatous calcifications are seen.  Mitosis are inconspicuous (less than 1/10 hpf) and there are patchy small foci of necrosis comprising than 5% of the tumour.  There are patchy foci of intratumoural acute and subacute haemorrhage.

1909	 2722	 Sections show a well-circumscribed chondroid tumour which arises immediately adjacent to the costal cartilage, displacing adjacent skeletal muscle.The lesion has a pushing margin, multinodular architecture and low cellularity with small clusters of chondrocytes set in hyaline cartilage matrix.  The cells have small hyperchromatic nuclei without significant atypia.  Mitoses are not readily identifiable.  The features favour a chondroma, with the location of the tumour suggestive of a periosteal chondroma.	 PHI:Null

1942	 1103	 Sections show a core biopsy which includes fat and skeletal muscle at one edge. The biopsy is almost entirely infiltrated by a high grade lymphoid neoplasm. The lymphoma comprises sheets of large cells, showing high grade nuclear atypia. Some tumour cells are multilobated. Mitotic figures including atypical mitoses are numerous. Apoptotic material is present. Scattered mature lymphocytes are seen in the background. There is extension of lymphoma into the adjacent fat.	 PHI:Null
1942	 1509	 Uniform CD45 expression by the tumour cells, confirms that this is a lymphoma. The lymphoma cells uniformly express B-lymphocyte markers including CD20 and Pax-5. They also express bcl-6 and bcl-2. CD10 is negative. There is no expression of CD30, cyclin D1 or CD138. T-lymphocyte markers CD3 and CD5 highlight small numbers of T-cells scattered in the background. The proliferation index Ki-67 is 70-80%.	 PHI:Null

1959	 8554	 Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	 PHI:Null

1969	 4263	 A.  The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sections show a epithelial predominant malignant mixed mullerian tumour (MMMT) centred within and replacing much of the right ovary, but also involving and expanding the lumen andwall of the right fallopian tube.  The tumour is predominantly (approximately 90%) composed of high grade serous carcinoma, however, a minority of the tumour (<5%) is associated with malignant stroma (A21) and by convention is classified as a MMMT.  No heterologous stromal differentiation is seen.  Approximately 10% of the tumour is poorly differentiated or shows clear cell differentiation (e.g. A20). A minute component of the tumour, sampled for frozen section showspossible squamous differentiation, however, no convincing endometrioid component is seen.  The carcinoma displays papillary, micropapillary and trabecular architecture and is composed of mitotically active cells with high grade nuclearfeatures.  There are extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour extends very close to but does not appear to penetrate the serosal surface.  There is associated surface haemorrhage and mesothelial proliferation.

1971	 3540	 Sections are ofskin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. There is an ulcerated crateriform lesion consisting of acutely inflamed fibrinous ulcer slough overlying a central core of laminated thrombus and extensive organising fibrin/haemorrhage. In areas, the organising fibrin/haemorrhage has a papilliform appearance, with cores of fibrin covered by plump endothelial cells. The endothelial cells show no significant cytologic atypia or mitotic activity. Necrosis is inconspicuous. At its periphery, the lesion is circumscribed and is surrounded by a variably thick irregular cuff of dense hyalinised fibrocollagenous tissue, organising fibrosis and fat necrosis. Special stains (Masson's trichrome, orcein and reticulin) highlight the cuff of hyalinised fibrous tissue, and although scattered distorted elastin fibers are present, no unequivocal elastic laminae are seen. Scattered collections of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefts are contained within the fibrocollagenous tissue. The fibrocollagenous tissue abuts the 12 o'clock (block 1) and deep margins (block 9), is 1.1mm from the 3 o'clock margin (block 4) and appearsclear of remaining margins. No infiltration of the surrounding dermocutaneous tissue by atypical cells or a vasoformative lesion is seen. The overlying intact epidermis shows reactive change and mild to moderate acute inflammatory cell exocytosis.	 PHI:Null

1971	 3871	 The 35mm ulcerated left chest wall mass is a circumscribed lesion composedof acute ulcer slough overlying a central core of organising fibrin/haemorrhage and surrounded by a variably thick cuff of fibrous tissue. There is no significant cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, necrosis or infiltration of surroundingtissues.	 PHI:Null
1971	 4425	 Overall, the features are most in keeping with a Masson's tumour (Papillary endothelial hyperplasia). Masson's tumours are considered to be exuberant forms of organising thrombus, and although most arise within the lumen of a vessel, extravascular Masson's tumours arise within haematomas at any site, and may present as deep soft tissue lesions. The pathologic differential diagnosis includes an angiosarcoma, however, the absenceof endothelial multi-layering, mitoses, necrosis and infiltration of the surrounding tissue, make this diagnosis unlikely.

1987	 1828	 Sections show a moderate to poorly differentiated carcinoma which is difficult to classify according to the morphological and immunohistochemical features.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2012	 The tumour shows a circumscribed low power growth pattern and is composed of sheets and nests of atypical epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2180	 There is a branching thin walled vasculature throughout the tumour, imparting a vague papillary architecture with occasional tumour cells having a columnar morphology.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2260	 In some areas the sheets of cells are associated with patchy foci of necrosis.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2300	 No convincing clear cell changeis seen.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2446	 Occasional nests of tumour cells show marked nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism consistent with a component of poorly differentiated carcinoma.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2656	 Carcinoma extends into the renal pelvis in a polypoid nodule which is partly beneath the urothelial lining but there is no definite origin from the urothelium and no urothelial carcinoma in situ is identified.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2794	 No vascular invasion is seen and the ureteric and vascular margins are free of tumour. There is no definite extension into perirenal fat.	 PHI:Null
1987	 2996	 The adjacent renal parenchyma shows patchy chronic interstitial inflammation and scattered sclerosed glomeruli as well as atheroma and calcification of large vessels, consistent with the patient's age.	 PHI:Null

1987	 3220	 PAX 8 is negative.	 PHI:Null
1987	 3376	 Comment: The tumour is difficult to classify as there are overlapping features between a papillary renal cell carcinoma and a transitional cell carcinoma.	 PHI:Null
1987	 3560	 The immunohistochemical profile is not diagnostic of either tumour, however, the negative staining for keratin 5/6 and keratin 20 would tend to exclude a transitional cell carcinoma.	 PHI:Null

1992	 2121	 A.  Sections of the large bowel show multiple diverticulae with associated hypertrophy of muscularis propria.  Multiple areas of abscess formation are present within the mesentery surrounded by organising granulation tissue, foreign body granulomas and fibrosis.  The polyp identified macroscopically is an inflammatory pseudopolyp.  Sixteen (16) lymph nodes are identified which show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	 PHI:Null
1992	 2668	 B.  Sections of the appendix show a fibrinous peritonitis.  In addition there is focal mucosal ulceration with cryptitis and architectural distortion.  No transmural acute inflammation is present.  A single granuloma is noted within the appendix wall.  No organisms are identified with PAS or Truant stains.  Although these changes may be secondary to diverticular disease or an incidental appendicitis, the possibility of Crohn's disease may need to be considered.  A single benign lymph node is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	 PHI:Null

2002	 3673	 "Immunoperoxidase stain for MDM2 shows between 25% to 50% of tumour cells with either nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining.  Only nuclear staining is regarded as overexpression of MDM2.  However, the MDM2 antibody for immunoperoxidase staining is only used for experimental purposes and should not be used for diagnostic purposes."	 PHI:Null
2002	 3900	 My understanding is that the MDM2 immunostain is less sensitive than FISH for detecting an MDM2 amplification but that a positive stain is helpful.  In this context it supports the diagnosis of well differentiated liposarcoma.	 PHI:Null

2007	 975	 Sections show thyroid.  There is a benign cyst present which has a dense fibrous wall.  There is follicular tissue within the cyst and this has a patchy infiltrate of pigment laden macrophages, consistent with the previous haemorrhage.  Some follicular tissue within and adjacent to the cyst also shows hyperplastic changes.	 PHI:Null
2007	 1485	 At one end of the specimen, adjacent to but apparently separate from the cyst, there is a papillary carcinoma, follicular variant.  This is present in three adjacent blocks so it is around 12mm in main diameter.  It is quite well circumscribed but is not encapsulated andshows some invasion to adjacent thyroid.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified and there is no extra thyroid spread.  It does not extend to the inked excision margins of the lobe.  Excision of the papillary carcinoma appears complete.

2015	 1031	 Specimen labelled "Abdominoperineal resection of rectum" consists of an abdominoperineal resection of rectum including anus measuring 190mm in length.  12mm from the anal verge and 30mm from the distal resection margin there is a polypoid and partly sessile tumour measuring 35 x 23mm which appears tooccupy approximately 30% of the circumference of the rectum.  The tumour is located entirely below the anterior peritoneal resection margin.  The tumour appears to be on the antero right aspect of the distal rectum.  The mesorectum appears predominantly intact in the specimen.  The right mesorectum is inked black and the left is inked blue.  Four 2 to 3mm polyps were identified in the rectum from 140mm to 150mm from the proximal resection margin.  The closest polyp to the anal verge is 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes were identified in the mesenteric and the perirectal fat.	 PHI:Null

2018	 6691	 Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	 PHI:Null
2018	 6826	 Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	 PHI:Null

2028	 3138	 Sections of the 53mm paraspinal lesion confirm the presence of recurrent sarcoma. The sarcoma has variably infiltrative margins and is partially surrounded by dense fibrocollagenous tissue and skeletal muscle. The sarcoma is moderately cellular and consists of highly pleomorphic epithelioid to stellate cells arranged in sheets and ill defined fascicles within fibromyxoid stroma. The tumour cells show coarsely clumped vesicular chromatin with variably prominent nucleoli. Scattered multinucleate and occasional bizarre cells are present. The tumour contains numerous small calibre blood vessels, including some larger haemangio-pericytomatous vessels, many of which show mural fibrosis, fibrinoid change and luminal thrombi, in keeping with the history of radiotherapy. The tumour shows scattered foci of haemorrhagic cystic change, but discrete foci of necrosis are inconspicuous. There are scattered mitoses.

The tumour is centred onthe anterior wall of the caecum but also extends onto its posterior wall and focally involves the ileocaecal valve.  The tumour contiguously invades and replaces the muscularis propria and reaches the junction of the subserosa and mesocolic fat.  The carcinoma is composed of complex and tubular glands lined by cells with stratified nuclei with moderate atypia. There is abundant intraluminal and extracellular lakes of mucin.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  A synoptic report for bowel cancer follows.	 PHI:Null

The specimen includes unremarkable appendix is 58mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  Centred on the anterior wall of the caecum but also involving its posterior wall and the ileocecal valve is a fungating exophytic tumour 84 x 75 x 24mm.   The tumour has pale solid and mucinous cut surfaces.  The tumour is 65mm from proximal ileal and 70mm from distal margins and does not involve the base of the appendix.  The posterior surface of the caecum appears to be peritonealised.  On sectioning the tumour appears to efface the plane of the muscularis propria but does not appear to involve the mesocolic fat.   No other polyps are identified.  Several lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 18mm in maximum dimension.	 PHI:Null

The tumour is centred on the anterior wall of the caecum but also extends onto its posterior wall and focally involves the ileocaecal valve.  The tumour contiguously invades and replaces the muscularis propria and reaches the junction of the subserosa and mesocolic fat.  The carcinoma is composed of complex and tubular glands lined by cells with stratified nuclei with moderate atypia. There is abundant intraluminal and extracellular lakesof mucin.

2069	 1621	 Sections show a fatty tumour.There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  There is oedema and there is a mild, patchy infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells.  There is also some fat necrosis with infiltration by macrophages.  No significant cytologic atypia is identified apart from the variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  No definite lipoblasts are identified.  The features are favoured to be those of a benign fatty tumour (lipoma) which has some mild atypical features.  However if confident exclusion of atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma is thought desirable than FISH to look for MDM2 amplification may be worthwhile.	 PHI:Null
