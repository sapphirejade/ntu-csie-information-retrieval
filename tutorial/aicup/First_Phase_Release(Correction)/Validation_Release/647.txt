MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr JWally - 3.3.2063)
The 17mm right breast lesion is a fibroadenoma. The fibroadenoma is partially lobulated, circumscribed and unencapsulated. The lesion is composed of benign ducts showing a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern with variably sclerosed stroma. There is patchy mild epithelial hyperplasia. The fibroadenoma extends to the inked/diathermied margin focally. There are no atypical features or evidence of a phyllodes tumour. There is no atypical ductal hyperplasia, DCIS or evidence of invasive malignancy. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast lesion: Fibroadenoma, present focally at margin.
