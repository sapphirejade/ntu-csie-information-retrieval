DR Rodger Beau TUGGLES
Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, raised CA - 125.  Bloody discharge R nipple.  Suture s = superior , L = lateral.  Right tube + ovary + appendix.  
Additional clinical history from Dr Lazcano:  Pt has a history of breast carcinoma and sister has had breast carcinoma.  BRACA status unknown.  Orientation of specimen is not important.   
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary + appendix"consists of a solid and cystic mass 90 x 70 x 70mm with a bosselated surface.  There is an adherent disrupted appendix 65mm in length and 7mm in maximum diameter.  A segment of fallopian tube 30 x 7mm bearing a ligation clip is also present.  The distal part of the tube, including the fimbrial end, are not identified.  A short suture is identified on the appendix.  A long suture is not identified.  On sectioning the tumour has a solid and cystic appearance.  The cystic areas are filled with serous material; much of the solid tissue is necrotic. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - frozen section; 4 to 11 - representative sections of the tumour; 12 - tumour from serosal surface; 13 & 14 - tumour with fallopian tube; 15 - tumour; 16 - two TS of proximal appendix; 17 - two LS of distal appendix.   
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma.  
Results to Dr Emons by Dr M Frase/Dr M Harrold 18/2/13 at 12.05pm.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix + left tube and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left tube and ovary weighing 54g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 30 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm thick.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 7mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length and 3mm in maximum diameter.  There is a metal ligation clip present.  A normal fimbrial end of the tube is identified.  The left ovary measures 20 x 15 x 10mm and is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - one full LS posterior body and cervix; 7 - two LS left fimbria; 8 - left ovary AE plus two TS left fallopian tube; 9 - right parametrial tissue; 10 - left parametrial tissue.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 30 x 20 x 20mm with one fatty lymph node 10 x 10mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph node; 2 & 3 - rest of fatty tissue.
D.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid mesentery" consists of two nodules of tissue with fatty areas and solid white areas measuring 10 and 7mm.  AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" consists of a solid white nodule measuring 10mm in diameter.   AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum 300 x 250 x 20mm.  On sectioning there is a white solid nodule 10mm in maximum diameter.  The rest of the specimen is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 - nodule; 2 & 3 - representative omentum.   (EO/ta 21/4/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Poor): 
A.  Sections of the right adnexal mass show a poorly differentiated serous carcinoma with variable architectural patterns and extensive necrosis.  Much of the tumour is composed of sheets of highly pleomorphic neoplastic cells but there are areas of better differentiation with complex papillae and slit-like glands.  The tumour cells show marked pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli.Numerous mitoses are present. No normal ovarian tissue is identified so tumour completely replaces the ovary and also involves right adnexal soft tissue.  Lymphovascular invasion is identified.  
The proximal fallopian tube is free of tumour.  The distal tube and fimbrial end are not identified in the sections.  Sections of the appendix show no significant abnormality. 
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is atrophic. The myometrium show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.   The left tube and ovary are unremarkable. The parametrial tissues show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections show three negative lymph nodes.
D, E, F.  Sections show deposits of poorly differentiated serous carcinoma. 


DIAGNOSIS: 
A.  Right tube and ovary, and appendix:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma of ovary.
 
B.  Uterus, left tube and ovary:  No abnormality seen. 

C.  Right external iliac lymph node:  Three negative lymph nodes (0/3). 

D.  Sigmoid mesentery:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma. 

E.  Sigmoid nodule:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
F.  Omentum:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.
