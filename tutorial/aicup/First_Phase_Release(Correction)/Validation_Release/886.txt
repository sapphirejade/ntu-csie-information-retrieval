CLINICAL:
Post menopausal bleeding.  ?Endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries, cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 138g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 45mm and has a smooth, dull serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm and appears haemorrhagic.A 3mm ?cervical polyp is present posteriorly.  On opening, a fungating endometrial tumour is present within the body and fundus.  The tumour measures approximately 60 x 60 x 20mm.  The tumour invades the inner half of the myometrium posteriorly (5 of 20mm), and the outer half of the myometrium anteriorly (7 of 10mm).  The myometrium contains fibroids up to 14mm.
The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 35 x 17 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 33 x 19 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.    
Blocks: 1 to 5 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 6 & 7 - further representative tumour posterior; 8 - tumour and right cornua; 9 to 12 - full LS anterior body and cervix (?cervical polyp in block 9); 13 & 14 - further representative tumour anterior; 15 - representative right tube; 16 - representative right ovary; 17 - representative left tube; 18 - representative left ovary; 19 - representative right parametrium; 20 - representative left parametrium; 21 - tumour reserve block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue 85 x 20 x7mm in aggregate.  The largest lymph node appears macroscopically involved by tumour. 
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node TSAE; 3 - one lymph node TSAE; 4 & 5 - lymph nodes.
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue 45 x 20 x 7mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node TSAE. 
  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue 16 x 7 x 7mm.  One lymph node TSAE 1 block.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fibroadipose 55 x 25 x 6mm.  Thelargest lymph node appears macroscopically involved by tumour.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node TSAE; 3 - one lymph node TSAE.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right uterosacral nodule" consists of a tumour nodule 17 x 14 x 13mm attached to a small amount of fibroadipose tissue.  Representative 1 block.  
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of multiple pieces of fibroadipose tissue 30 x 20 x 8mm in aggregate.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 20 x 9 x 7mm in aggregate. 
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes.  (TO: HZ; SQ/ta 2/8/62)
 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Rabelo):
A.  Sections show extensive grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 6mm through a wall 8mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolvedand unremarkable.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality. 
B.  One of eleven (1 of 11) lymph nodes shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.  This deposit is 5mm.  No extracapsular spread is seen.
C.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One of five lymph nodes shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.  This deposit is 9mm.  No extracapsular spreadis seen.
F.  Sections show a nodule of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
G.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence ofmalignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 6mm through a wall 8mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.  Two of twenty five (2 of 25) lymph nodes show metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The right uterosacral nodule shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 5/8/64:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all showpreserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
