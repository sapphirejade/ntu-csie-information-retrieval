CLINICAL:
?Mets to lung.  Wedge biopsy of right lower lobe of lung.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right lower lobe of lung" consists of a wedge of lung, 60 x 30 x 20mm.  The external surface has an area of pleural puckering, 15 x 5mm.  On sectioning in the area of pleural puckering there is a white solid tumour measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - representative sections of the tumour with margin; 5 - reserved block.  (TO: PG; PG/mm 12.2.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Dutil):
Sections show a 20 mm deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin.  
The lesion has a similar morphology to the colorectal primary, and has a mixed glandular and solid architecture.  The glands are lined by columnar tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei, and have central areas of necrosis.  The adjacent lung shows mild emphysematous changes.
The tumour cells are positive for CK20 and are negative for CK7 and TTF-1. 
There is no evidence of surface pleural involvement.  
The lesion is 2 mm clear of the resection margin.
DIAGNOSIS
Wedge biopsy right lower lobe lung: 20mm metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin, margins clear
