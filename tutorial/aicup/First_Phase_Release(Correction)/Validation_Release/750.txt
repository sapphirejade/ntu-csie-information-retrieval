HISTORY                    
Appendiceal mucinous Ca. Peritonectomy. Right diaphragmatic strip. Right abdominal peritoneal strip. Bilateral ovaries.
MACROSCOPIC              
"OMENTUM, BILATERAL OVARITECTOMY, PERITONEAL TISSUE". A piece of omentum, measuring 300x300x20mm. There is a large piece of peritoneum measuring 300x150x10mm. Attached to one edge is an ovary measuring 30x15x10mm. A second ovary is not identified. There are also strips of peritoneum and blood clot. The strips measures 20-40mm in maximum dimension. Attached to the ovary is a length of fallopian tube measuring 30mm in length x 5mm x 5mm in maximum dimension. The cut surfaceof the ovary is unremarkable. The outer surface of the ovary is unremarkable. The omentum consists of normal fibrofatty tissue with scattered haemorrhagic to grey tan nodules onthe surface which range from 2-5mm. The peritoneum has a mucinous haemorrhagic area on the surface which is over 50x40mm. 
(1 ovary; 2 fallopian tube; 3-7 haemorrhagic adherent nodules to omentum; 8-11 peritoneal strips with overlying haemorrhagic area; 12 & 13 solid nodular area within peritoneum; 14 & 15 representative ?peritoneal fragment). RS (M-15/TJ/cy)
MICROSCOPIC           (Dr B Piganelli)
Sections of ovaries show changes consistent with age.  The sections of fallopian tube are unremarkable.  No mucinous material is identified on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube. Sections of omentum show a single tiny area of mucin on the serosal surface, in which no epithelium is identified.  Sections of peritoneum showsome surface deposits of organising mucin, in which no epithelial component is identified.  No invasive tumour is seen in the tissue examined.
DIAGNOSIS             
OMENTUM, BILATERAL OVARITECTOMY, PERITONEAL TISSUE :
-ORGANISING MUCIN ONTHE PERITONEAL AND OMENTAL SURFACE, WITH NO EPITHELIAL COMPONENT IDENTIFIED.
