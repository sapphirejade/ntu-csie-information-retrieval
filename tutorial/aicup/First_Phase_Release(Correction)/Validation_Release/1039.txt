CLINICAL:
Endometrial curettings showed papillary serous carcinoma and sarcoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 47g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 40 x 27mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is a tumour within endometrial cavity 52 x 30 x 15(depth)mm.  The tumour appears to be at least 4mm from the serosal surface.  The myometrium is 14mm in maximum thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 6mm in maximum diameter.   The left ovary measures 17 x 12 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal of posterior body and cervix; 7 - representative section of tumour posterior body of uterus; 8 - representative section of tumouranterior body of uterus, reserve block for tumour bank; 9 - representatives right fallopian tube; 10 - representatives right ovary;11 - representatives left fallopian tube; 12 - one representative left ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 40 x 27 x 6mm.  There are up to three lymph nodes the largest being 30mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 - two likely lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node trisected.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of a 30 x 17 x 6mm lymph node with surrounding fatty tissue and a separate tan fragment 12 x 5 x 3mm (?lymph node).  The larger lymph node is serially sliced.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - comprise one lymph node; 3 - ?lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 38 x 20 x 10mm and contains a 25 x 15 x 8mm lymph node serially sliced and AE 1 block.   
E.  Specimen labelled "Left external ileac nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 45 x 25 x 8mm containing a lymph node 30 x 10 x 6mm serially sliced.  AE 1 block.
(JZ/ta 11/10/62) 
F.  Specimen labelled "Infracolic omentectomy", consists of a piece of omental tissue 250 x 100 x 25mm.  Specimen is thinly sliced.  No nodules are seen.  Blocks 1-3 - representative sections.   (LS/ec  11.10.62)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr F Eslinger)
A.  Sections show a malignant mixed mullerian tumour of the endometrium.  Most of the tumour is serous carcinoma (70%).  A very small endometrioid adenocarcinoma component is noted (5%).  No heterologous elements are seen in the sarcomatous component (25%).  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 8.5mm through a wall 9mm thick, but focally extends even closer to the serosal surface at 0.3mm.
No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
E.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
F.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
  
DIAGNOSIS:
Malignantmixed mullerian tumour of the endometrium, depth of invasion 8.5mm through a wall 9mm thick.  Cervix uninvolved.  No lymphvascular invasion.  The omentum and seven lymph nodes are negative.
