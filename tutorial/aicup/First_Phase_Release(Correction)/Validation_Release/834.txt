HISTORY:  
Ulcerative Crohn's  + CRC currently heavy peritonectomy. Peritoneal nodule.Frozen section. 
MACROSCOPIC:  
A. "PERITONEAL NODULE". Two pieces of pale, fibrous tissue measuring 14x10x10mm and 12x10x10mm.
F/S: "No evidence of malignancy" per phone to Mcfarlan (anaesthetist at Theatre 5) at 9:28am on 11/12/13 by Dr. U. Landrey.
(1 frozen section; 2 remainder of the tissue). AE (M-2)
B. "LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE". ?fallopian tube measuring 15x12x10mm. Cystic area is about 12mm in diameter. The cyst contains watery brown fluid. 
F/S: " No evidence of malignancy" per phone to Professor Rebold at 10:28am on 11/12/13 by Dr. U. Adolph.
(1 frozen section; 2 remainder of the tissue). AE (M-2)
C. "LEFT OVARY". Pale, fibrous tissue measuring 7x5x3mm. 
F/S: " No evidence of malignancy" per phone to Professor Homme at 10:28am on 11/12/13 by Dr. U. Moncier.
(1 frozen section). AE (M-1)
D. "RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE". Cystic lesion measuring 35x35x25mm with cyst filled with watery blood stained fluid.
F/S: "No evidence of malignancy" per phone to Professor Vandon at 10:28am on 11/12/13 by Dr. U. Wiedman.
(1 frozen section; 2 & 3 remainder of the tissue). AE (M-3)
E. "MESENTERY LYMPH NODE". Fatty node measuring 10x6x5mm.
F/S: " No evidence of malignancy" per phone to Professor Ying at 10:28am on 11/12/13 by Dr. U. Esqueda.
(1 frozen section). AE (1-1)
F. "SMALL BOWEL". Small bowel measuring 450mm in length with circumference up to 50mm. Within the adjacent mesentery there is a firm pale lesion measuring 60mm in diameter. On the section the tumour appears pale pink and fibrous, and appears close to the bowel wall but separate from it. It has relatively well circumscribed periphery. The small bowel is otherwise unremarkable. The tumour appears clear of the mesenteric resection margin by 3-4mm.
(1 RS LS of margin one of the bowel; 2 RS LS of margin two of the bowel; 3-12 RS TS of the tumour). RS (M-12/MP/cy)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr.Kai Karman)
A.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle containing an area of mature fibrous scarring.  There is also a large piece of refractile vegetable material surrounded by a foreign body giantcell reaction.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
B.  Histology shows a distorted piece of fallopian tube containing some blood within the lumen, but with no evidence of malignancy identified. Small serosal foci of  reaction to degenerate material, possibly vegetable in nature is seen.
C.  Histology shows a piece of fibrous ovarian cortex with no evidence of malignancy present.
D.  Histology shows a further piece of distorted appearing fallopian tube which contains a large foreign body giant cell reaction to refractile vegetable material with patchy chronic inflammation within the wall. There is a benign cystic lesion with moderate chronic inflammation and haemosiderin deposits in its wall, which may represent part of a dilated segment of the tube (? Haematosalpinx secondary to obstruction). Noevidence of malignancy is identified.  

E.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in one small reactive lymph node.  
F.  Histology shows the solid tumour within the small bowel mesentery to be a spindle cell lesion consisting of relatively abundant collagenous fibrotic stroma with an intermediate cellularity population of spindle cells which have mildly atypical nuclei.  Scattered elongated tortuous arching vessels are seen throughout the stroma withscattered lymphocytes.  There is no discernable mitotic activity or areas of necrosis or high grade atypia. The periphery of the tumour is mostly well circumscribed but some irregular infiltrative areas are present. Thetumour lies close to the small bowel wall but does not appear to arise directly from it. Immunostains show patchy positivity for smooth muscle actin, desmin and vimentin and negativity for c-KIT, CD34, S100, cytokeratinand Bcl-2.  Five entrapped lymph nodes at the edge of the lesion show no evidence of malignancy.  The small bowel is otherwise unremarkable.  
The appearances are consistent with those a desmoid fibromatosis.  The lesion appears to be clear of the mesenteric fatty resection margin by 4mm.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  PERITONEAL NODULE - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
B.  LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
C.  LEFT OVARY - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
D.  RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
E.  MESENTERIC LYMPH NODE -
-  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN ONE NODE.
.  SMALL BOWEL - DESMOID FIBROMATOSIS, MARGINS CLEAR.
