ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (20.5.63)

CLINICAL:
Left buttock sarcoma excised in Bankstown.  Nodule left buttock -?sarcoma.  Frozen section - lesion left buttock.  Re-excision of left buttock sarcoma; stitch at 12 o'clock and double stitch at deep margin.  The specimen sent for frozen section was from the centre of the specimen (where it has been reapproximated with stitches).  A re-excision of the deep margin was performed and sent separately and this has a stitch at the new deep margin.
[Fresh tissue is sent to WEST WIMMERA HEALTH SERVICE - JEPARIT's Hospital for cytogenetics.  Fresh tissue is taken fortumour banking].
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Nodule left buttock" consists of two pieces of tan tissue 12 x 6 x 5mm and 10 x 5 x4mm.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section tissue.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Sarcoma present.
Phone result to Registrar by Dr C Schmutz at 11.38am on 28/2/13.
B.  Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left buttock; stitch 12 o'clock, double deep margin" consists of an excision of skin and subcutaneous tissue 160 x 95 x 90mm.  The deep margin is inked black, the 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9o'clock margin green.  The ellipse of skin measures 140 x 45mm.  There is a central polypoid appearing area with oversewn gauze which measures 40 x 20mm which appears to correspond to the previous excision site.  At the 9 o'clock edge of the skin there is an excision which measures 100mm which has been re-sutured.  The cut surface reveals a soft cream and slightly haemorrhagic tumour which measures 45 x 40 x 45mm.  There is an adjacent cavity noted at the 9 o'clock marginwhich measures 40 x 60 x 70mm.  There is a portion of tumour that appears to communicate with the skin.  The tumour appears to abut the deep margin.  The tumour is 3mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 50mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 10mm from the 12 o'clock margin and well clear of the 6o'clock margin.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - tumour with deep margin; 3 & 4 - tumour with 3 o'clock margin; 5 - 9 o'clock margin; 6 & 7 - representative tumour; 8 & 9 - representative 12 o'clock margin; 10 - representative 6 o'clock margin; 11 - representative old incision site; 12 - reserve block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Re-excision deep margin, stitch new deep margin" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 25x 25 x 5mm.  There is a stitch at one side to mark the deep margin.  The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sectioned and AE six blocks.  (NM/cc 3/5/63)
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Ingram): 
A &B.  Sections show a relatively well circumscribed tumour within deep soft tissue.  The tumour comprises of a mixture of spindle cells, round to oval cells and multinucleated giant cells.  There is marked cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.  There is brisk mitotic activity.  Focal areas of prominent stromal hyalinisation and coagulative necrosis are present.  Numerous tumour giant cells are present throughout the tumour.  Some of the giant cells are osteoclastic-like.  The tumour infiltrates into the surrounding adipose tissue.  No definite vascular invasion is seen.  There is a cavity adjacent to the tumour, which is in keeping with previous surgery.  The overall appearances are similar to those described in the previous pathology report (WHYALLA HOSPITAL Hospital, DICKINSON 2 SOUTH, CY-11-113968).  The appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma with giant cells.  The tumour is completely excised.  The tumour is 5.5mm to the deep margin (block B2) and is 4mm to the 3 o'clock soft tissue margin (block B4).  The other margins are well clear.
C.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative slides are shown to Dr C Budniewski.
DIAGNOSIS:
A to C.  Left buttock - Undifferentiated high grade sarcoma with giant cells.

Analysis:

Karyotype:
No dividing cells seen (7 slides scanned).
Comment:
Tissue extremely difficult to dissociate and ?necrotic: regrettably, no mitoses were available for cytogenetic analysis.  Please advise the Laboratory (8382 9154) should interphase FISH be on paraffin-embedded tissue be of assistance in this case.
