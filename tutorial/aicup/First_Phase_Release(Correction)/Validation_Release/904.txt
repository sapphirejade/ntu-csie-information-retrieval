CLINICAL:
Left axilla sentinel node for breast Ca.  Hx of biopsy proven L breast Ca for mastectomy and SNBx.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left breast specimen lymph node 1" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35 x 25 x 12mm.  One lymph node 25mm is identified.  Imprints made for cytology.  
Blocks: 1 - imprint one; 2 - imprint two.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
There is no evidence of malignancy - Negative. 
Result to Dr AUGUST YONTS via theatre RN by Dr P Pargo and Dr P Manocchia at 15.40pm on 19/12/12. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast marking stitch at superior" consists of a mastectomy 160mm (medial to lateral) x 155mm (inferior to superior) x 28mm (superficial to deep).There is an overlying ellipse of skin 145 x 45mm which includes a nipple areola complex 30 x 30mm which appears unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.  The cut surface reveal a firm cream/yellow stellate poorly circumscribed lesion 1-2 o'clock position 45mm from the nipple (lesion one).  Lesion one measures 20mm (medial to lateral) x 13mm (inferior to superior) x 9mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is as follows:  deep margin 3mm, superior superficial 17mm, and well clear of medial, lateral and inferior margins.  There is an ill defined firm area at 5 o'clock position 50mm from the nipple which measures 8mm (medial to lateral) x 6mm (inferior to superior) x 6mm (superficial to deep).  Superficial margin is 4mm away, the deep margin is 10mm away and is well clear of the medial and lateral margin.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - tumour in two slices to skin, superficial, deep and superior margins; 5 - tissue medial to tumour; 6 - tissue lateral to tumour; 7 to 9 - representative area of firm and ?calcification; 10 & 11 - representative in inner upper quadrant; 12 & 13 - representative inner lower quadrant; 14 & 15 - representative outer lower quadrant; 16 & 17 - representative outer upper quadrant; 18 - nipple and tissue deep to nipple (additional block 18is approximately 30mm from block 3).; 19 - tumour reserve block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Berta): 
A-C.  Sections show three separate invasive carcinomas.  The main carcinoma at 1-2 o'clock 45mm FN is a grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 1).  A separate grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 2) is present around the large  subareolar ducts of the nipple and is approximately 30mm from the main carcinoma.  An incidental 2.3mm grade 1 infiltrating tubular carcinoma (tumour 3) is present about 2mm deep to tumour 2.  
Paraffin sections of the single sentinel lymph node show a minute cluster of tumour cells with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina within the subcapsular sinus measuring <0.1mm in maximum dimension (detected on an H&E stained section, block A1L2). This particular area has cut out on deeper levels examined with H&E and keratin immunostains, however, in adjacent tissue in the same cross section keratin immunostained sections reveal further dispersed single tumour cells within the subcapsular sinus distributed over an area of 4mm.  The total number of tumour cellsin this cross section, both H&E and keratin immunostain detected number less than 200 cells and is consistent with node involvement by isolated tumour cells of lobular carcinoma.  However in a separate cross section of the sentinel lymph node, keratin immunostains reveal a further minute cluster of cohesive and single tumour cells 0.3mm in dimension as well as dispersed single cells in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses, distributed over an area of 5mm.  While an interpretation of this second separate focus of intranodal tumour cells as isolated tumour cells is possible (the 0.3mm cluster is not strictly a completely cohesive and expansile cluster and the total number of tumour cells in this crosssection number less than 200 cells), I have classified it as a micrometastasis (recognizing overlap in the definition).
The left axillary tissue submitted (specimen C) is composed of fatty tissue only.

	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 1 (25/3/63)(Reported by Dr P Armbrester)
Within the epidermis of the nipple, overlying tumour 2, there are scattered medium to large  intraepithelial cells with round to oval regular nuclei and minimal cytoplasm (Blosk B21). No cell clusters or intracytoplasmic lumina are seen The dPAS stain for mucin is negative.  The cells show positive expression with CK7 and ER immunostains.  The cells are negative for Melan A, CD138 and HER2 (1+).  The appearances favour benign Toker cells over Paget's disease. The cells are 9mm clear of the closest cutaneous margin.
