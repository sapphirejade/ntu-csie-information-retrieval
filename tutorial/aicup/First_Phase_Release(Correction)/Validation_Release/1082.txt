CLINICAL:
81yr old woman with Ova cancer stage 3C.  TAH/BSO/omentectomy.  Hx of PE on Clexane at the moment.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries cervix" consists of a uterus with attached tubes and ovaries weighing 68.1g in total.  The uterus measures 75 x 40 x 25mm. The serosal surface is covered by fibrous tissue both anteriorly and posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximal thickness and the myometrium is 11mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.
The left ovary measures 15 x 15 x 13mm and the left fallopian tube 30 x 5mm.  There are several nodules in the left adnexal soft tissue, the largest 13 x 10 x 7mm.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 17mm and the right tube 25 x 5mm.  Both ovaries are abnormally adherent to the uterus.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS through the anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full LS through the posterior body and cervix; 7 - further section of posterior endometrium; 8 to 14 - section through the anterior uterine body with attached presumed ovary; 15 - left fallopian tube; 16 - second nodule in left adnexa; 17 to 21 - presumed right ovary continuous with uterine corpus; 22 - right fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel nodule" consists of three pieces of tissue 7 to 10mm.  AE 1 block.
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 90 x 20 x 20mm.  The tissue is firm with multiple cream nodular deposits.  There is a cyst which measures 6 x 6 x 6mm which is thin walled, unilocular and contains brown fluid.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative omentum; 2 - containing the cyst.   (CA/ta 23/5/63) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Chrisman):
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Scattered groups of tumour cells within fibrous and fibroblastic tissue are adherent to the serosa of both the anterior and posterior uterus.  The tumour is most consistent with a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  There are scattered psammoma bodies.  Sections of left and right adnexa show adhesions between the ovaries, tubes and uterus and there is tumour within this adhesional fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.  Tumour is involving the serosa of both ovaries and there is some tumour involvement within the ovaries but the ovaries are not enlarged.  Sections of the fallopian tubes show involvement of the fimbrial end of the right tube, and very focal involvement of the fimbrial end of the left tube, by carcinoma.    
Allthe tumour in this specimen shows chemotherapy effect; between 50% and 90% of tumour is replaced by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue. 
B.  Sections show a deposit of tumour consistent with serous carcinoma.  This consists of scattered groups of tumour cells within the fibrous and fibroblastic tissue, consistent with chemotherapy effect.
C.  Sections of omentum show involvement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is evidence of chemotherapy effect with between 50 and 90% replacement of original tumour by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue.
Comment:  Serous carcinoma with this distributionwould generally be considered to be primary peritoneal.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Serous carcinoma involving uterine serosa and left and right adnexal soft tissues.  Focal involvement of ovaries and fimbrial ends of fallopian tubes.  Tumour shows chemotherapy effect.
B.  Small bowel nodule:  Serous carcinoma showing chemotherapy effect.
C.  Omentum:  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma showing chemotherapy effect.
