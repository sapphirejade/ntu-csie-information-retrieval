CLINICAL:
Axilla sentinel node biopsy.  Left 12 o'clock 35mm calcs cored - DCIS.  Mastectomy.  Suture short superior long lateral.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary sentinel lymph node", consists of one piece of tissue 13 x 8 x 5mm.  One lymph is identified measuring 10mm in maximum dimension for imprints. 
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node.

IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
No evidence of malignancy.
Phone results to Dr Renita Byron-STGEORGE by Dr I Maderios at 19:55 on 21.01.14
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast long lateral short superior", consists of a mastectomy specimen with two marking stitches measuring 230 (lateral to medial) x 190 (superior to inferior) x 50 (superficial to deep)mm.  The overlying skin is 75 x 45mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  No lesions are seen in the skin.  Superficial margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  There are ill defined pale fibrotic areas present in all four quadrants of the breast but mainly towards the centre.  No distinct nodule are identified.  At 12 o'clock 45mm from the nipple there is a haemorrhagic focus 12mm in maximum dimension. (? biopsy site).
Blocks:1 to 9 - sequential sections from 11 to 1 o'clock; 4 and 5 - paired sections (4 deep margin; 5 - includes the haemorrhagic area); 6 - the remainder of the haemorrhagic area; 10 and 11 - continuous sections nipple and tissue behind nipple; 12 and 13 - random sections upper inner quadrant; 14 and 15 - random sections lower inner quadrant; 16 and 17 - random sections of lower outerquadrant; 18 and 19 - random sections upper outer quadrant.  Please see diagram.
