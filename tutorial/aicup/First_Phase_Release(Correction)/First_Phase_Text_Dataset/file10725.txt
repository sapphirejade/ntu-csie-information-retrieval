T otal thyroid &amp;#8211; left hemithyroid and right hemithyroid.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right hemithyroidid13916397&amp;#8221; consists of right hemithyroidectomyid9850239  weighing 47g and measuring 69mm (from superior to inferior), 45mm (from left to right) and  30mm (from anterior to posterior).  The tracheal margin is inked black.  Specimen serially sliced from superior pole to in ferior pole into thirteen slices.  Within the mid pole of the thyroid is a ?colloid cyst 3081measuring 7 x 7 x 5mm and towards the upper pole is another smaller ?colloid cyst with an area of haemorrhage measuring 7 x 5 x 3mm.  R S 5 blocks.

bchMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Laware)
A.  The right hemithyroid has been examined in its entire ty. Sections of the thyroid show changes of multinodular goitre, including colloid filled follicles of varying size with nodule formation and patchy fibrosis. There are scattered hyperplastic follicular (adenomatoid) nodules with focal Hu rthle cell (oncocytic) change. There are four papillary microcarcinomas, follicular and mixed papillary/follicular subtypes, ranging from 0.56mm to 6.0mm. The carcinomas extend focally to less than 0.6mm from the inked margin. No convinci ng lymphovascular space invasion or extrathyroidal extension is seen.

B.  The left hemithyroid  has been examined in its entirety. Sections of the thyroid show changes of multinodular goitre, including colloid filled follicles of varying size with nodule formation, patchy fibrosis and focal organising haemorrhage. There are scatter ed hyperplastic follicular (adenomatoid) nodules with focal Hurthle cell (oncocytic) change. An incidental 1.1mm papillary microcarcinoma (follicular variant) is identified (B7), which is unencapsulated and is less than 0.1mm from the ink ed margin. No convincing lymphovascular space invasion or extrathyroidal extension is seen.
