Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Left lateral chest wall recurrent spindle cell sarcoma (HI 73 983085 undifferentiated sarcoma of spindle cell type, Grade 3, 73Y8308- residual atypical spindle cells at margin) . Sutures short = 12 o&amp;apos;clock, medium = anterior, long = posterior.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left lateral chest wall sarcoma short stitch at 12 o&amp;apos;clock, medium anterior, long posterior&amp;quot;, consists of an ellipse excision of skin 95 x 46 x 20mm. Three sutures are present as described. There are four possible tan macules on the skin surface which range in size from 2-5mm. Long stitch will be denoted 3 o&amp;apos;clock/posterior and medium stitch will be denoted 9 o&amp;apos;clock/anterior. 3 o&amp;apos;clock inked blue and 9 o&amp;apos;clock inked black. The specimen is sectioned from 12-6 o&amp;apos;clock into nine slices.   Within the skeletal muscle is a tan and circumscribed and firm nodule 12 x 10 x 11mm. The lesion is 4mm to the deep margin, 7mm deep to the skin surface, 9mm from the
9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and 17mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin. The lesion is 40mm from the 12 o&amp;apos;clock tip and 43mm from the 6 o&amp;apos;clock tip. No areas of haemorrhage or necrosis are seen to the tumour.
Blocks 1 &amp;amp;  2- LS slice 1 (12 o&amp;apos;clock); 3-5 - slice 4; 6-8 - slice 5; 9-10 - LS slice 9 (6 o&amp;apos;clock); 11 - remaining tumour (entire tumour nodule embedded). See diagram. (TO:YL/ec 4/7/71)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Hammarlund):
The representative sections from the oriented wide local excision include epidermis to subcutis and skeletal muscle. Some suture material is in keeping with the known previous procedures.

There is a circumscribed densely hyalinsed nodule from slice 4 to 5 (block 4, 7 and 11) centred in the subcutis to skeletal muscle. Mostly it is low in cellularity with small foci of moderate cellularity. There are variable quite atypical spindle cells. They have irregular nuclei with smudged dense chromatin and at times large cherry red nucleoli. Some eosinophilic nuclear inclusions are present. Occasional bizarre large nuclei are seen. Mitoses are sparse and only focal mitotic activity is present (2 mitoses/10 HPF with field diameter 0.55, 4). Scattered chronic inflammatory cells are seen intermixed. Some haemosiderin is noted within the tumour. Adjacent the fibrous stroma shows some increase in more bland spindle cells with a tongue like advancing front (similar in appearance to the previous excision). At times the distinction from reactive stroma is subjective. There is no perineural invasion and no lymphovascular invasion. The peripheral margins are at least 9mm and the deep margin at least 3mm with an intact soft tissue plane (7).

A benign dermal naevus is noted in the adjacent superficial dermis (2).


DIAGNOSIS:
Left lateral chest wall, oriented excision: Residual spindle cell sarcoma, completely excised.
