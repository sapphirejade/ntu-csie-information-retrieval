HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Low grade appendix tumour.  Peritonectomy.  Omentum, gallbladder, right iliac fossa peritoneum, falcifomr ligament.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM&amp;quot;.  Consists of a gallbladder and two pieces of fatty tissue consistent with omentum.  Gallbladder measures 90mm in length x 25mm maximum diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth.  On opening there is a 15mm stone within the lumen. The wall is up to 3mm thick. Mucosa is granular green.

(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus)

The separate pieces of fatty tissue consistent with omentum altogether measure 300x200x25mm.  No firm or suspicious areas are identified on sectioning.

(3-5 omentum).  RS (M-5)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA PERITONEUM STITCH ADJACENT TO PERITONEAL NODULE&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with suture as described.  It measures 190x110x12mm.  There is a small nodule noted adjacent to the stitch.  It measures 6mm maximum dimension and a firm area measuring 7mm maximum dimension.

(1 nodule adjacent to stitch; 2 firm area within the peritoneum; 3&amp;amp;4 further RS). RS (M-4)

C.  &amp;quot;FALCIFORM LIGAMENT&amp;quot;. A piece of fibrofatty tissue.  It measures 60x20x15mm.  There are two nodules noted on the surface 1-2mm maximum dimension.

(1 two nodules; 2 further section of falciform ligament). RS (M-2/MC/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr I Mallory)
A. No mucinous deposits are seen over the surface gallbladder or within the omentum. A small reactive lymph node is present within the fatty omental tissue. The gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.

B.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with foci of maturing fibrous scar tissue. Adjacent to the suture there is a small focus of acellular organising extracellular mucin with focal microcalcification within. No atypical epithelial cells are present. Elsewhere there is also a small amount of adjacent skeletal muscle.

C.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue which contains a medium sized partially obliterated vessel within the middle of the tissue. Focally over the surface are a few small deposits of serosal  organising acellular mucin. No atypical mucinous epithelium is seen.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM - NO EVIDENCE OF MUCINOUS TUMOUR.

B. RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA PERITONEUM STITCH ADJACENT TO PERITONEAL NODULE -
- FOCAL SEROSAL ORGANISING ACELLULAR MUCIN.

C.  FALCIFORM LIGAMENT - FOCAL SEROSAL ORGANISING ACELLULAR MUCIN.
