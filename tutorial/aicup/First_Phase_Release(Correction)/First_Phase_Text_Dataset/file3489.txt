HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
DANDENONG HOSPITAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES

CLINICAL NOTES:
L breast Ca (NAC) frozen section left sentinel lymph node.  L breast ca, wide local excision, left nipple/areolar complex. Sutures long-lateral, medium-medial, short-superior.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;LEFT SENTINEL NODE&amp;quot;. A piece of fatty tissue 30mm in maximum diameter with two fatty nodes 15 (blue) and 10mm (pale).  One TS of each node taken for frozen section.
(1 FS; 2 remainder of blue node; 3 remainder of pale node).  RS (M-3).

Frozen section report:  &amp;quot;Negative. Fatty nodes difficult to cut&amp;quot;.  To Dr Vance by Dr  Gattas at 3.35 pm

BREAST INVASIVE CARCINOMA SYNOPTIC REPORT
(based on CAP guidelines 2017):

INVASIVE CARCINOMA:

MAXIMUM INVASIVE TUMOUR SIZE:  17 mm diameter

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Invasive carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Grade 2 (see comment end of report)

SCORES: Tubules 3, Nuclei 2,  Mitoses 1;  Total Score: 6 of 9

MITOTIC RATE: 0 mitoses per 10 high power fields

WHOLE TUMOUR SIZE (Invasive + DCIS): 17 mm

PERITUMOURAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION:
Lymphovascular invasion is present
Extent of lymphovascular invasion: Several foci

PERINEURAL INVASION:  Not identified

SKIN INVOLVEMENT:
Involved, invasive carcinoma directly invades into the dermis and very focally without  epidermal ulceration.

DERMAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified

NIPPLE INVOLVEMENT: Invaded directly by invasive carcinoma. Nipple structure is obscured and flattened. The tumour very focally extends into overlying crusted epidermis (incipient focus of  Paget disease).

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS):
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present, associated with invasive carcinoma.
Size (extent) of DCIS:  DCIS is present only within areas of invasive tumour.
Nuclear grade: Intermediate grade
Architecture/type: cribriform
Necrosis: Not identified
Calcification of DCIS: Not identified
Extensive intraductal component (EIC): Negative

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is present, several foci, classical type LCIS

MARGINS:
Invasive carcinoma margins:

Margin status, invasive carcinoma: Negative
Distance of invasive carcinoma to closest margins: 6 mm, superior and inferior margins

DCIS margins:
Margin status, DCIS: Negative
Distance of DCIS to closest margins: &amp;gt; 10 mm

Skin margins are negative for invasive carcinoma and DCIS and the small focus of incipient Paget disease.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC):
Block B5
Other suitable tumour block for testing: B7

ER:      POSITIVE:  90% of nuclei, 3+ intensity
PR:      POSITIVE:  5% of nuclei, 2+ intensity
HER2 by Immunohistochemisty:  IHC 0 negative
Ki-67:  10%
e-cadherin: positive in all areas of invasive tumour. LCIS is negative

SEPARATE FINDINGS:  No significant changes.

LYMPH NODES:
Sentinel lymph nodes negative for tumour
Nodes with macrometastases: 0
Nodes with micrometastases: 0
Nodes with isolated tumour cells: 0
Total number of nodes examined: 2

Pathologic Stage Classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th ed, 2017): pT1c N0 (sn)

Comment(s):
1.  The invasive carcinoma has variable appearances.  In the more superficial parts of the tumour, there is moderate tubule formation but the deeper parts of the tumour show  single cells and small clusters without tubules, and combined with moderate nuclear atypia the tumour is best graded as grade 2 rather than grade 1.

2. The carcinoma involves dermis, extending from the superficial epidermis and extends into subjacent predominantly fatty breast tissue.  The DCIS extends into subjacent fatty tissue.  The area of ?nipple is flattened and distorted and crusted.  The carcinoma invades dermal smooth muscle of of apparent areolar tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  LEFT SENTINEL NODE
- sentinel lymph nodes negative for tumour (0/2)

B. LEFT BREAST LESION, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- 17 mm diameter
-  invasive carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features
- grade 2 (see comment)
- peritumoural lymphovascular invasion is present, several foci
- skin and effaced nipple involved by direct invasion.
- incipient focus of epidermal involvement (incipient Paget disease)
- ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) component
- lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) present, several foci
- distance of invasive carcinoma to closest margins: 6 mm
- distance of DCIS to closest margins: &amp;gt;10 mm
