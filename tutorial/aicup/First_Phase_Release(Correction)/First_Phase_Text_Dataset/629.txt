CLINICAL:
BRCA 1 +  R 1 o'clock ? fibroadenoma.  Bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy. 
+ tissue behind nipple left and right breast. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tissue behind nipple right breast", consists of a piece of tissue 5 x 4 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Tissue behind left nipple", consists of a piece of tissue 5 x 2 x 2mm. AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Right breast long lateral, short superior, medium medial", consists of a mastectomy with three sutures for orientation as above measuring 140mm medial to lateral, 130mm superior to inferior and 40mm superficial to deep margin. The superficial margin is inked blue, deep margin black.  On sectioning and in the upper inner quadrant (1 o'clock) there is a nodule 15 x 10 x 10mm. The rest of the parenchyma a fibrofatty appearance.
Block 1 - tissue from the nipple; 2 - representative section nodule in upper inner quadrant; 3-5 - representative sections upper inner quadrant; 6- 8 - representative sections upper outer quadrant; 9-11 - representative sections lower innerquadrant; 12-14 - representative sections lower outer quadrant; 15-17 - three representative sections upper inner quadrant; 18-20 - three representative sections upper outer quadrant; 21-23 - three representative sections lower inner quadrant; 24-26 - three representative sections lower outer quadrant.   (YD/bl 15/10/62)
D.  Specimen labelled "Left breast long lateral, short superior, medium medial", consists of a mastectomy with three sutures for orientation as above measuring 130mm medial to lateral, 110mm superior to inferior and 40mm superficial to deep margin. The superficial margin is inked blue, deep margin inked black.  On sectioning the cut surface has a fibrofatty appearance.  No lesions are identified.  
Block 1 - nipple; 2-4 - representative sections upper inner quadrant; 5-7 - representative sections upper outer quadrant; 8-10 - representative sections lower inner quadrant; 11-13 - representative sections lower outer quadrant.  (FL/ec 10.10.62)
14-16 - three sections upper inner quadrant; 17-19 - three sections upper outer quadrant; 20-22 - three sections lower inner quadrant; 23-25 - three sections lower outer quadrant.   (CC/bl 15/10/62)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Cruel): 
A & B.  Sections show benign breast ducts and lobules.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
C & D.  Both breast specimens show a similar appearance with extensive proliferative changes including sclerosing adenosis, fibrocystic change and columnar cell change without atypia and with mild atypia.  Numerous foci of benign luminal microcalcification are present.  Multiple fibroadenomas are present within the right breast and foci of fibroadenomatoid change are seen within the left breast.  Scattered dilated ducts show florid ductal hyperplasia of usual type and a number of small intraduct papillomas.  Foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) are present within both breasts.  The specimens have been extensively sampled and no invasive malignancy is seen. 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - D.  Right and left breasts:
-  Extensive benign proliferative changes (see above).
-  Fibroadenomas and fibroadenomatoid change
-  Intraduct papillomas. 
-  Foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH).
