B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Whipple&amp;quot;, consists of a specimen of distal stomach (30mm long), small bowel (190mm long), gallbladder (110mm long and up to 130mm in circumference), proximal pancreas (90 x 65 x 55mm) and omental fatty tissue (310 x 140 x 20mm).  The pancreatic margins and surfaces are inked as follows: anterior blue, portal vein bed red, SMA green, uncinate black and posterior blue.  There is a multilocular cystic tumour within the pancreas 55 x 45 x 40mm.  The dominant cyst within the tumour measures 44 x 30 x 30mm.  The cyst is filled with clear fluid.  The cyst is 1mm from portal vein bed, less than 1mm from SMA, 10mm from the uncinate, 22mm from anterior, 6mm from pancreatic neck and 15mm from posterior pancreas.  The cyst is well away from the common hepatic duct, proximal gastric and distal small bowel margins.  The main pancreatic duct is not identified.  The serosal surface of the gallbladder is smooth and glistening.  The wall of the gallbladder is up to 3mm thick.  The mucosa is green and granular.  No gallstones are seen.  The common hepatic duct is not dilated. The pancreas is blocked from superior to inferior.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; shave, hepatic duct margin; 2 and 3 &amp;#8211; paired sections shaved pancreatic neck margin; 4 and 5 &amp;#8211; paired sections slice one (block 4 anterior, block 5 posterior; the slice contains uninked shaved neck); 6 and 7 &amp;#8211; paired sections slice two (block 6 anterior and block 7 posterior; the slice contains part of the uninked shaved neck); 8 and 9 &amp;#8211; paired sections slice three (block 8 anterior and block 9 posterior); 10 and 11 &amp;#8211; paired sections slice four (block 10 anterior and block 11 posterior); 12 and 13 &amp;#8211; slice six (block 12 &amp;#8211; anterior and block 13 posterior); 14 and 15 &amp;#8211; slice seven (block 14 anterior and block 15 posterior); 16 &amp;#8211; one RS of the inferior edge of the pancreas the section includes posterior, uncinate and SMA margins; 17 &amp;#8211; one RS of the inferior edge, the section includes uncinate and SMA margins 90% of the pancreas is blocked; 18 - ?peripancreatic lymph node as seen; 19 &amp;#8211; one peripancreatic lymph node bisected; 20- peripancreatic lymph node; 21 &amp;#8211; peripancreatic lymph node as seen; 22 &amp;#8211; one peripancreatic lymph node; 23 &amp;#8211; one peripancreatic lymph node; 24 &amp;#8211; one peripancreatic lymph node; 25 - ?one peripancreatic lymph node; 26 &amp;#8211; TS neck of gallbladder; 27 &amp;#8211; TS body of gallbladder; 28 &amp;#8211; TS fundus; 29 &amp;#8211; shave proximal gastric margin; 30 &amp;#8211; shave distal small bowel margin; 31 &amp;#8211; omental lymph node as seen; 32 - ?one peripancreatic lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Pancreatic body and tail suture body&amp;quot;, consists of distal pancreas and surrounding soft tissue 145 x up to 55 x 20mm.  Anterior is inked blue, inferior red and posterior black.  There is a suture marking body.  The specimen is serially sectioned and sequentially blocked from proximal towards distal. There are four cysts ranging from 10 to 35mm in maximum dimension. The larger slices are further sectioned and are blocked from superior towards inferior.
Blocks: 1 and 2 &amp;#8211; shave proximal margin, slice one and 3 and 4 &amp;#8211; slice two (block 3 superior and block 4 inferior); 5 to 7 &amp;#8211; slice three from superior to inferior; 8 to 10 &amp;#8211; slice four from superior to inferior; 11 to 13 &amp;#8211; slice five from superior to inferior; 14 to 16 &amp;#8211; slice five from superior to inferior; 17 and 18 &amp;#8211; slice six (block 17 superior and block 18 inferior); 19 and 20 &amp;#8211; slice nine; 21 and 22 &amp;#8211; slice ten; 23 and 24 &amp;#8211; slice eleven; 25 and 26 &amp;#8211; slice twelve; 27 and 28 &amp;#8211; slice eleven; 29 and 30 &amp;#8211; slice twelve; 31 and 32 &amp;#8211; one slice; 33 and 34 &amp;#8211; one slice; 35 and 36 &amp;#8211; one slice; 37 and 38 &amp;#8211; one slice; 39 and 40 &amp;#8211; one slice; 41 and 42 &amp;#8211; one slice; 43 and 44 &amp;#8211; one slice; 45 &amp;#8211; one slice; 46 &amp;#8211; one slice; 47 &amp;#8211; one slice; 48 &amp;#8211; one slice; 49 and 50 &amp;#8211; one slice; 51 to 53 &amp;#8211; one slice; 54 and 55 &amp;#8211; one slice; 56 and 57 &amp;#8211; one slice (distal).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Jaconski):
A.  Paraffin sections confirm an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with focal high grade epithelial dysplasia.  In addition, a few small glands are present suspicious for invasive carcinoma.
B.  Sections show well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the neck of the pancreas extending into peripancreatic adipose tissue.  Carcinoma extends to the pancreatic neck resection margin.  There is extensive involvement of the pancreatic body and neck by IPMN with focal high grade epithelial dysplasia.  The duodenal mucosa shows subtotal villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis consistent with coeliac disease.
C.  Sections show extensive involvement of almost the entire length of the tail of pancreas by IPMN with focal high grade epithelial dysplasia.  Foci suspicious for invasion are present towards the pancreatic neck margin.
The combined features for specimens A to C are as follows:
Histological tumour type
Ductal adenocarcinoma (foamy gland pattern)
Histological grade
Grade 1:  Well differentiated (greater than 95% of tumour composed of glands)

Microscopic tumour sites
Neck of pancreas

Extent of tumour invasion
Peripancreatic soft tissues

Maximum tumour diameter
18mm
Lymphovascular invasion
Present
Type of vessel
Small vessel

Perineural invasion
Present
Perineural invasion of the superior mesenteric artery (uncinate) margin neural plexus
Not identified
Pre-invasive lesion
Present (IPMN with focal high grade dysplasia, extensively involving body and almost entire length of tail of pancreas)
Margins:
Pancreatic neck:  Not applicable (not pancreatectomy)
Common hepatic duct:  Well clear
Portal vein (superior mesenteric vein):  Well clear
Superior mesenteric artery:  6mm clear
Periuncinate soft tissue:  Well clear
Surfaces:
Anterior:  Well clear
Posterior:  Well clear
Lymph nodes:
Number found:  31 (specimen B), 15 (specimen C)
Number involved:  0
Other pathologies:
- Duodenum show subtotal villus atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis consistent with coeliac disease.
- Gallbladder shows no significant abnormality.
