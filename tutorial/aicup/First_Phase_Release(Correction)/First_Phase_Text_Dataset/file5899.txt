HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
HX of mucinous ovarian cancer. Recurrence with peritoneal metastasis. Peritonectomy, bilateral diaphragm peritoneum, spleen, gallbladder, omentum, transverse colon, peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE, BILATERAL DIAPHRAGM&amp;quot;. Received multiple fragments of tissue in the same jar including a length of bowel with attached omentum. The bowel measures 90mm in length and up to 50mm in circumference with attached mesocolon to a width of 30mm. The attached omentum is fibrotic measuring  220x110x35mm. The omentum appears to be nodular and extensively involved by nodular tumour deposits, largest measures 50x25x30mm with hard white cut surface that is focally adherent to the wall of the adjacent bowel centrally 50mm of the nearest longitudinal resection margin but no definite mucosal involvement is identified. Further sectioning of the omentum reveals disseminated firm white deposits (omental cake).

(1 LS peripheral margin of bowel; 2 LS of other peripheral margin; 3&amp;amp;4 bowel wall with adjacent omental involvement; 5 three lymph nodes; 6-8 RS involved omentum).

Received a spleen with adherent fibrous tissue consistent with peritoneum and fibrofatty tissue with a total weight 303g. The spleen measures 170x95x40mm. The attached fibrous tissue measures 90x80x5mm and the fibrofatty tissue 100x50x35mm. The possible peritoneum is adherent to the splenic capsule and appears to be involved by minute (up to 2mm) white nodular deposits. Firm white area is also identified at the splenic capsule. The cut surface of spleen reveals red parenchyma with a single cyst measuring  35x25x25mm that has minute papillary excrescences over an area of 10mm. The remainder cut surface of the cyst is smooth and tan in colour. This cyst is located beneath the peritoneal adherent tissue. The cut surface of the adherent fatty tissue reveals firm white area measuring  10mm (tumour deposit).

(9-11 RS splenic capsule with adjacent spleen tissue; 12 normal spleen tissue; 13 four LS peritoneal deposits; 14 firm white area in the adjacent fatty tissue).

Received a gallbladder measuring  60x30mm. The outer surface is ragged, haemorrhagic with multiple adhesions at the body area. The wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosal surface is green and granular. No calculi identified.

(15 cystic duct and TS neck; 16 TS body and LS fundus).

Received multiple fibrous tissue consistent with peritoneum some of which is attached to pieces of possible muscle ?diaphragm with a total measurement of 190x180x50mm in aggregate. Multiple firm minute nodules are identified on all fragments.

(17-19 RS peritoneal nodules; 20 tumour from omental cake block for tissue banking). RS (M-20/VN/ht).

MICROSCOPIC:     (Dr I Bendavid)
Sections show moderately to poorly-differentiated high-grade adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows extensive involvement of the sampled omentum with adhesions to the surface of the spleen and the excised large bowel segment. There is also involvement of the peritoneum and diaphragm.

The adenocarcinoma is characterised by glandular, solid, micropapillary and single cell infiltration with focal signet ring cell morphology. The carcinoma is associated with extensive stromal desmoplasia. The cells are characterised by large pleomorphic nuclei with a central prominent nucleolus and relatively brisk mitotic activity, together with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is relatively widespread tumour necrosis. A PAS stain with diastase suggestion shows patchy cytoplasmic mucin. There is no extracellular mucin. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for CK7 and PAX8 with focal positivity for CK20. There is focal positive staining for HBME-1, Calretinin and CK5/6. Tumour is negative for TTF-1, p53, WT1 and CDX-2.

The splenic parenchyma is unremarkable. The large bowel mucosa is unremarkable. Sections of the gallbladder show no convincing evidence of inflammation. There is patchy serosal congestion. Some of the peritoneal fragments include skeletal muscle suggestive of origin in the diaphragm.

Comment: The features are those of a high-grade moderately to poorly-differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. The immunoprofile is consistent with but not specific for origin in the female genital tract. A pathology report from The Mater Laboratory Services, CENTRAL COAST, 3/9/2065, Lab # 3312C365716 documents mucinous carcinoma of the the left ovary, endometrium and fallopian tube with a very similar immunophenotype. The current appearances are consisitent with metastatic disease.

DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, TRANSVERSE COLON, PERITONEAL AND DIAPHRAGMIC BIOPSY
- WIDESPREAD METASTATIC MODERATELY TO POOLY-DIFFERENTIATED HIGH-GRADE ADENOCARCINOMA.
- APPEARANCES OF IMMUNOPROFILE CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN IN A FEMALE GENITAL TRACT.
- METASTATIC DEPOSITS INVOLVING OMENTUM, PERITONEUM AND DIAPHRAGM WITH ADHESIONS DUE TO SEROSAL ASPECT OF THE TRANSVERSE COLON AND THE SPLENIC CAPSULE.
