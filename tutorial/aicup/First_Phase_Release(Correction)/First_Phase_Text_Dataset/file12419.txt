Specimen_type: Fresh Tissue
Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Left ovarian mass.  Ca125 - 280.  TAH and BSO for 5cm ovarian cyst.  Strong FH of ovarian cancer.  Serous cystadenoma on FS.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left tube and ovary&amp;#8221; consists of a unilocular thin walled cyst measuring 60 x 60 x 45mm with attached fallopian tube measuring 42 x 7mm.  There is a small area of grey white thickening measuring 19 x 8mm.
Frozen section one - thickened area.
Frozen section two - cyst wall distal to thickened area.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 to 13 - all of the cyst; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - all of the fallopian tube.  AE.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous cystadenoma.
Result to Dr GAIL ENDOW by Dr M Watwood at 1:48pm on 30.05.2016

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, cervix, right fallopian tube and ovary&amp;#8221; consists of a uterus with attached cervix and right fallopian tube and right ovary weighing 152.1g.  The uterus measures 100 x 65 x 50mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 35mm and has unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 29mm thick.  The myometrium has two fibroids, measuring 6mm and 20mm across.  The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with an outer diameter of 6mm.  The serosal surface is unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 20 x 8 x 10mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.
Blocks:  1 to 7 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 8 to 14 - LS of posterior body and cervix; 15 &amp;amp; 16 - representative sections of fibroid; 17 to 24 - all of adnexa (17 to 19 - fallopian tube; 20 to 24 - ovary).

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omental biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of fatty tissue measuring 90 x 50 x 30mm.  Cut surface shows uniform fatty tissue.  No lesion is seen.  Representative sections embedded in blocks 1 to 3.  (TO: LM; LM/rt 3.7.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Coder):
A.  The whole specimen has been blocked.  Sections of the ovary show a serous cystadenoma.  There is no atypia or evidence of malignancy.  There is some endometriosis in the paraovarian soft tissue.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.
B.  Sections of the cervix show two or three adjacent vessels in the deep stroma which have fibrinoid change in their walls and surrounding inflammation; the features are of a focal vasculitis which is most likely isolated and of no significance.  The sections of cervix are otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.
The ovaries and fallopian tubes have been blocked in their entirety.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  There are a few small simple cysts in the right ovary.  The ovary is otherwise unremarkable.
C.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No abnormality is seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left ovary and fallopian tube:
1.  Serous cystadenoma.
2.  Endometriosis in paraovarian soft tissue.

B.  Uterus, right ovary and fallopian tube:
1.  Uterine leiomyomas.
2.  Focal vasculitis in deep cervical stroma, see text.

C.  Biopsy omentum:  No abnormality seen.
