CLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrial cancer.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right ovary and right fallopian tube weighing 147g in total.  The uterus measures 95 x 70 x 50mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 35mm and is unremarkable. On sectioning the endometrium is haemorrhagic and there is a possible area of thickening on posterior wall measuring 5 x 5mm.  The endometrium elsewhere appears thin.  The myometrium is up to 20mm in maximum thickness and there are multiple fibroids ranging from 3-30mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 65 x 8 x 5mm.   The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. The endometrium is AE.   Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4-6 - full LS of anterior left endometrium; 7 &amp;amp; 8, 9-11, 12, 13 - Anterior right endometrium (includes part of the posterior right endometrium); 14-17 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 18 - remainder of posterior left endometrium; 19 &amp;amp; 20 fallopian tube; 22 - right ovary.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omental biopsy&amp;#8220;, consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 20 x 20 x 5mm and 18 x 5 x 2mm.  No lesions are found on sectioning.  Specimen AE 1 block.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right obturator lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of four pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 15, 20, 30 and 45mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are found ranging from 5-40mm in maximum dimension. The largest is serially sectioned.  The lymph nodes are AE.
Block 1 &amp;amp; 2- lymph nodes as seen; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right common iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue 15 x 6 x 5mm.  No lymph node is identified within the fibroadipose tissue.  Specimen AE 1 block.

E.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right external iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue, 20 and 30mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are found ranging from 5-50mm in maximum dimension.  The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - lymph nodes as seen.

F.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left obturator lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue 100 x 30 x 50mm.  Lymph nodes are found ranging from 3-40mm in maximum dimension. The largest lymph node is serially sectioned. The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1 &amp;amp; 2- lymph nodes as seen; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - one lymph node serially sectioned.

G.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left common iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of  piece of fibrofatty tissue 10mm in maximum dimension.  No lymph nodes are found within the fibrofatty tissue. AE 1 block.

H.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Left external iliac lymph node&amp;#8220;, consists of multiple pieces of fibroadipose tissue ranging from 3-40mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are found ranging from 2-30mm in maximum dimension. The largest lymph node is serially sectioned. The lymph nodes are AE.  Block 1- lymph nodes as seen; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - one lymph node serially sectioned

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Zanetti):
A.  The whole endometrium has been blocked.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium which mainly involves the anterior wall of the body and fundus.  The tumour shows focal squamous and mucinous differentiation.  The tumour invades the myometrium.  Maximum depths of myometrial invasion is 9mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 14mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  There is no cervical involvement.
A benign endometrial polyp is also noted.
Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Multiple leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium; the myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.
Sections of the left fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the left ovary show a few benign epithelial inclusions but the ovary is otherwise unremarkable.

B.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.

C.  Sections show eight lymph nodes.  Benign epithelial inclusions are noted within one node.  No tumour is seen.

D.  Sections show fat.  No lymph node is seen.  No tumour is seen.

E.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.

F.  Sections show nine lymph nodes.  A few benign epithelial inclusions are noted within one node.  No tumour is seen.

G.  Sections show fat.  No lymph node is seen.  No tumour is seen.

H.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, left ovary and fallopian tube:
1.  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion, stage 1B.
2.  Uterine leiomyomas.

B.  Omental biopsy:  No tumour.

C.  Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/8).

D.  Right common iliac tissue:  No lymph node, no tumour.

E.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).

F.  Left obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/9).

G.  Left common iliac tissue:  No lymph node, no tumour.

H.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3).
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (26.7.2066)
(Reported by Dr Y Kofa):
MSI immunohistochemistry was performed as requested.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
