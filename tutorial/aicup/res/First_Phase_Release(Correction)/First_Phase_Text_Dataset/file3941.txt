(1&amp;amp;2 RS of tumour deposit)
Gallbladder &amp;#8211; A collapsed gallbladder measuring 75x30mm.  The external surface is smooth and shiny with no definite tumour areas identified.  No cystic duct node is present. There is no suture or staple at the resection margin.  On opening thereare no stones identified.  The mucosa is green and velvety.
(3 TS resection margin;4 two representative TS body)
An unorientated piece of peritoneum with attached ?vessel ?ligament measuring 70mm in length and 6mm in diameter.  There is clot attached and some rough areas, however no definite tumour deposit is identified.

Fatty tissue with possible node.  The tissue measures 60mm in maximal extent.  There is a 20mm ? tumour deposit identified.
(7 possible node possible tumour deposit; 8 possible ligament; 9 separate possible node 20mm)
Small Bowel &amp;#8211; A segment of small bowel 120mm in length and 30mm in diameter.  External surface shows a mesenteric tumour deposit 15mm in maximal extent located 30mm from the mesenteric resection margin.  The serosal surface of the bowel wall has multiple smaller possible tumourdeposits.  On opening the mucosa shows some lymphoid appearing nodules and no mass lesions are identified.  One resection margin inked blue, opposing resection margin black.  Two nodes are identified.
(10&amp;amp;11 LS resection margin; 12 mesenteric and serosal tumour deposits; 13 two possible nodes)
Small segment of bowel &amp;#8211; A small segment of bowel measuring 30mm in length with one ragged resection with no staples or sutures and opposing linearresection. The surface is ragged ? tumour ? adhesion.  On opening the mucosa is unremarkable.  Staple line removed, inked blue.  Opposing unstapled margin inked red.

Rectum and Tumour &amp;#8211; Consists of  rectum with peri-rectal fat in continuity with a  convoluted adherent mass of colon, measuring in aggregate 150x160x100mm. The proximal area of this loop is dilated measuring 60mm in diameter. Located 50mm from the distal resection margin, the specimen has been previously incised (inked green, not true margin).  On the right aspect of the specimen there is a shortsegment of adherent small bowel 70mm in length and 30mm in diameter.  The small bowel mucosa is unremarkable on opening.  Resection margins of small bowel inked green and black.  The proximal resection margin of the colon is inked blue and the distal resection margin is inked black. The perirectal fat is inked red.  The right mesenteric fat surface is inked black. On sectioning, there is a necrotic gelatinous tumour involving the right aspect of the specimen and 60x50x40mm. The origin of the tumour is difficult to assess in the context of multiple adhesions and destructive tumour (?primary sigmoid colon). There are no anastomoses apparent in the mass. The adjacent mesenteric fat is firm (? inflammatoryreaction). Adherent to the right side of the specimen, is a possible elongated lymph node measuring 50mm in maximal extent and there is adherent fat with ? vessel attached.  No seminal vesicles are identified.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr H Trailor)
A.  Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of benign peritoneal strip.  There is extensive immature fibrosis with chronic inflammation and scattered lymphoid aggregates.  A simple benign reactive lymph node is also included.
B.  Sections of the tumour mass show moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon which infiltrates through the full thickness of the muscularis into pericolorectal tissue. One section only of the tumour includes adjacent benign mucosa with a probable in situ component in keeping with primary sigmoid colon origin. The serosal surface overlying the tumour is not directly visualised.  However, sections from the area of adhesion with a small bowel segment show both a suppurative cleft, together with infiltrative adenocarcinoma. Serosal serosal surface involvement is inferred from this section.  Two of seven identified pericolorectal lymph nodes show involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  One benign lymph node is identified in the small bowel segment.
Sections confirm extensive involvement of the omentum by metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma and sections of the peritoneum also confirm involvement by metastatic moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Sections of the gallbladder show features of mild chronic cholecystitis with thickening of the muscularis and an occasional Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus.
A number of macroscopically described firm pieces of tissue, suspected to be tumour, show areas of immature fibrosis with chronic inflammation.
Sections of the small bowel mucosa are unremarkable.  There is focal serosal involvement of a small bowel segment by metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
C.  Sections show one benign reactive lymph node.  There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy.
D.  Sections show one benign reactive lymphnode.  There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy.
E.  Sections show one benign reactive lymph node.  There is no evidence of metastatic malignancy.
F.  Sections confirm benign seminal vesicle.  There is noevidence of malignancy.

Mismatch repair enzymes

Immunostains:  (Block:B34)
MLH1:  	POSITIVE (normal)
PMS2: 	POSITIVE (normal)
MSH2: 	POSITIVE (normal)
MSH6: 	POSITIVE (normal)
Comment:
Mismatch repair gene deficiency NOT DETECTED

Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.


Microsatellite instability (MSI):  not tested
