Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
60 y.o. Stage 1b1 cervical adenocarcinoma.  For radical hysterectomy, BSO, bilateral PLND.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right external iliac lymph node&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue measuring 30 x 15 x 5mm.  Two lymph nodes identified.  All lymph nodes are embedded for frozen section.  1.  Larger lymph node, 2. Smaller lymph node, 3. Remaining fatty tissue.

FROZEN SECTION RESULT:
Adenocarcinoma plus possible endosalpingiosis in one of two lymph nodes (1/2)
Result to Dr Gasperi by Dr U Kronau at 15:37 on 16/01/17

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, tubes + ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 47g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 40 x 25mm and has a small shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  In the endocervical canal, there is a plaque like lesion on both the anterior and posterior body with a surface area measuring 15mm x 12mm, 16 x 14mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 9mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length with an upper diameter of 5mm. The right ovary measures 15mm x 10 x 6mm.  The cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  The fimbrial end of the fallopian tube is adherent to the ovary.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length with an upper diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 15mm x 10 x 6mm.  The cut surface is unremarkable. Blocks:  1 to 3 - longitudinal sections of anterior body and cervix, 4 to 12 - All of anterior cervix embedded from right to left, 13 to 16 - full longitudinal sections of posterior body and cervix, 17 to 24 - All of posterior cervix embedded  from left to right, 25 and 26 - RS of right adnexa (25 - fallopian tube, 26 - ovary), 27 and 28 - RS of left adnexa (27 - fallopian tube, 28 - ovary).

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left external iliac&amp;quot;, consists of fatty tissue measuring 20mm x 10 x 5mm.  Two lymph nodes identified measuring 5 to 10mm.  Blocks:  1 - one lymph node, 2 - one lymph node.  AE.  (TO: LM; LM/eh 19/3/2067)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Ellisor):
A.  One of three lymph nodes shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.  No extracapsular spread is seen.

B.  Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endocervix.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 7mm through a wall 10mm thick, a length of 15mm, and an estimated width of 20mm.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is present.  Carcinoma is clear of the vaginal margin by 10mm.
A small amount of AIS is adjacent.  No CIN is seen.
The endometrium is inactive.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.

C.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endocervix, depth 7mm through a wall 10mm thick, length 15mm, width 20mm.  Extensive lymphvascular invasion is present.  One of five (1 of 5) lymph nodes shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.
