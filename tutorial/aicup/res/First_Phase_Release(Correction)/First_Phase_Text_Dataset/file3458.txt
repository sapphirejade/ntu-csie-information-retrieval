CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer grade 2.  HTN.  Righttube + ovary, pelvic tissue frozen section.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot; consists of a solid mass, 60 x 45 x 30mm with uninvolved overlying fallopian tube 60mm in length.  The majority of the mass has a smooth external surface, with a granular area occupying &amp;lt;20% of the surface.  The cut surfaces show a circumscribed fleshy tan tumour with haemorrhagic areas.
Blocks:  1 - tumour with granular surface for FS;2- RS of tumour for FS; 3 &amp;amp; 4 - fallopian tube; 5 to 7 - tumour with granular surface; 8 to 10 - RS tumour.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenocarcinoma, favour endometrioid grade 3.
Phone result to Dr D Killings by Dr D Mcravin/Dr D Pohlman.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary plus fibroid&amp;quot; consists of a uterus with cervix and left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 688g in total.  The uterus with cervix is 180 x 150 x80mm.  The ectocervix is 20 x 20mm.  The uterus is distorted by multiple intramural and subserosal fibroids.  The largest fibroid is 110 x 80 x 60mm.  The remaining fibroids range from 10-40mm across.  The endometrial cavity is markedlydistorted, with the majority of the endometrium appearing atrophic.  There is an exophytic polypoid lesion which appears to arise over the endometrium overlying a large fibroid.  This polypoid lesion is 40 x 25 x 30mm.  The tumour appears to infiltrate into the myometrium by a depth of 5mm, through a maximal myometrial thickness of 45mm.  The left fallopian tube is 60mm in length, and the left ovary is 25 x 20 x 20mm.  Also received is a separate fibroid, 80 x 50 x 50mm, and a separate smooth grey nodule with a patchy calcified and haemorrhagic cut surface.  A separate fragment of tumour with surface necrosis is received, 45 x 35 x 10mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - anterior body and cervix; 4 to 7 - posterior body and cervix; 8 &amp;amp; 9 - anterior tumour; 10 to 12 - anterior tumour with full thickness of myometrium; 13 - posterior tumour overlying fibroid; 14 - RS largest fibroid; 15 to 17 - separate grey nodule with haemorrhage and necrosis; 18 - left fallopian tube and ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right external iliac lymph node&amp;quot; consists of two pieces of adipose tissue 15 and 20mm across.  One lymph node is identified, 10mm across.
Blocks:  1 - onelymph node; 2 - remaining specimen.  AE.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left external iliac lymph node&amp;quot; consists of two pieces of adipose tissue both 20mm across.  One lymph node is identified, 15mm across.
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2- remaining fragments.  AE.
E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right obturator lymph node&amp;quot; consists of multiple fragments of adipose tissue, 55 x 35 x 10mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 30mm across.
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - largest lymph node; 3 - one lymph node; 4 - multiple lymph nodes.
F.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left obturator lymph node&amp;quot; consists of multiple fragments of adipose tissue, 40 x 20 x 10mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, up to 8mm across.
Blocks:  1- multiple lymph nodes.
G.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right common iliac lymph node&amp;quot; consists of a piece of adipose tissue, 35 x 20 x 10mm.  One lymph node is identified, 25mm across.
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - one lymph node.
H.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right paraaortic lymph node&amp;quot; consists of fragments of adipose tissue 35 x 20 x 10mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified up to 15mm across.
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - multiple lymph nodes.
I.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Periumbilical nodule&amp;quot; consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue, 70 x 65 x 35mm.  One surface is partially covered by peritoneum.  There is an ill defined pale grey nodule with surrounding fat necrosis, 25mm across.
Blocks:  1 to 3- RS through nodule.
J.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot; consists of a piece of omentum, 150 x 60 x 20mm.  No focallesions are seen.  RS in three blocks.
(TO: KT:  KT/mm .4.2.65)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Revells)
A.  Sections show a poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary.  The tube is uninvolved.
B.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The depth of invasion is difficult to measure due to the distortion of the uterus, however I estimate the depth to be11mm through a wall 45mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion is present.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  The left ovary and tube are unremarkable.
In addition, the separate specimen received shows a leiomyoma extensively involved by poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (similar in appearance to specimen A).
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI are pending.
C.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy.
H.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
I.  Sections show scarring, fat necrosis and suture granulomas.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
J.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the right ovary.  This tumour also involves a separate leiomyoma (?subserosal ?broad ligament).
Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth 11mm through a wall 45mm thick.  Focal lymphvascular invasion present.  Cervix uninvolved.
The ovarian and the endometrial tumours are favoured as synchronous primaries.
Nineteen (19) lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 12/2/65:

Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins on both specimens A &amp;amp; B:

MLH1:  Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2:  Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2:  Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6:  Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
