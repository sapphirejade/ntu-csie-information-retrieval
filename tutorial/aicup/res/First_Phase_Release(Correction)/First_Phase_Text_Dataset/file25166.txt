Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Adenosarcoma in polyp with possible myoinvasion.  Laparoscopic hysterectomy + bilateral salpingectomy.  Menorrhagia.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus cervix bilateral tubes&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes measuring 75 x 50 x 40mm.  The cervix measures 40 x 35mm and posteriorly has a roughened surface across an area of 20 x 10mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 65 x 5mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a diameter of 7mm.  The posterior endometrium shows a small sessile area 10 x 10mm ?residual tumour.
The specimen is sliced from cervix to fundus longitudinally.  All of the endometrium and the majority of the body and fundus and parametrium is embedded. (Please see attached diagram).
Blocks: 1 - TS right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 2 - TS left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 3 to 20 - full longitudinal sections from cervix to fundus anteriorly (blocks 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 11, 12 to 14, 15 to 17 and 18 to 20 serial slices.  3 to 5 - left; 18 to 20 - right); 21 to 38 - posterior cervix and fundus (block 21 to 23, 24 to 26, 27 to 29, 30 to 32, 33 to 35, 36 to 38 single slice.  21 to 23 left; 36 to 38 - right).

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of fat 75 x 30 x 6mm.  No solid tumour is seen.  RS in 3 blocks. (TO: MS;MS/vo/rs 4.4.67)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr T Chhuon):
A.  Sections show residual adenosarcoma of the endometrium posteriorly (blocks 28, 31 and 34).
Sex cord like elements are present as well as focal periglandular stromal condensation.  Early myometrial invasion is present 2mm deep through a wall 20mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.
The remaining endometrium shows late secretory change.  Both tubes are unremarkable.

B.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Residual adenosarcoma of the endometrium with early myometrial invasion, depth 2mm through a wall 20mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion seen.  Cervix and omentum uninvolved.
