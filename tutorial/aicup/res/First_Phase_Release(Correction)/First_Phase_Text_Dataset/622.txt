Adenocarcinoma of the endocervix on cone biopsy.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing in total 110g. The uterus measures 90 x40 x 40mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 35 x 35mm. The ectocervical surface is pink and smooth. The endocervical surface is ulcerated in an area measuring 10mm from proximal to distalconsistent with the previous cone biopsy site.  No definite tumour is seen.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is unremarkable. The right fallopian tube is 50 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria is present and appears unremarkable. The right ovary is 25 x 20 x 10mm. The external surfaceis unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable. The left fallopian tube is 55 x 5 x 5mm. The fimbria is present and unremarkable. The left ovary is 30 x 15 x 10mm. The externalsurface and the cut surface of the ovary is unremarkable.  Blocks 1-3 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4-12 - anterior cervix embedded from left to right; 13-15 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 16-24 - posterior cervix embedded from right to left; 25 - 2LS right fimbria; 26 - one section of right ovary and 1TS right fallopian tube; 27 - 2LS left fimbria; 28 - one representative section of left ovary and 1TS left fallopian tube. (Please see diagram attached).
B.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 60 x 60 x 10mm containing seven lymph nodes ranging from 10-30mm. 
Block 1- five lymph nodes; 2 & 3- one bisected lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50 x 40 x 10mm containing four lymph nodes ranging from 10-20mm. 
Block 1- two lymph nodes; 2 & 3- one bisected lymph node each. 
D. Specimen labelled "Right common iliac node", consists ofa piece of tissue 50 x 10 x 10mm containing three lymph nodes measuring from 10-15mm.  Block 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - two lymph nodes. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50 x 25 x 10mm containing six lymph nodes ranging from 5-20mm.  Block 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - four lymph nodes; 3 - one bisected lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator", consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 25 x 10 x 10mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 10 and 25mm.  Block 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator", consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 60x 40 x 20mm containing three lymph nodes ranging from 2-25mm.  Block 1- one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 - one lymph node. 
(TO: NS:TS/ec 23.4.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr A Hirst)
A.  The entire cervix has been examined.  Atiny focus of residual adenocarcinoma is present (block 20).  This has a maximum depth of invasion of 0.6mm through a wall 13mm thick, and a length of 0.6mm.  One focus of adjacent lymphatic invasion is present.  Adenocarcinoma is well clear of the vaginal margin.  Foci of residual adenocarcinoma in situ are also present (blocks 20, 21 & 13).  No CIN is seen.
The endometrium is essentially inactive.  Both ovaries and tubes show no significant abnormality.
B.  Seven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Six lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Two lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Focal residual adenocarcinoma ofthe endocervix depth 0.6mm, length 0.6mm.  One focus of lymphvascular invasion present.  Twenty five (25) negative lymph nodes.
