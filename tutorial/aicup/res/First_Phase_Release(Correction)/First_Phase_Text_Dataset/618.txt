CLINICAL:
Left mastectomy.  Previous excision of invasive ductal carcinoma and re-excision for DCIS at margin.  DCIS at margin of re-excision hence mastectomy.  Stitch lateral.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left breast (stitch lateral)" consists of a breast measuring 160mm (medial-lateral) x 140mm (inferior-superior) x 30mm (superficial-deep).  There is an overlyingellipse of skin measuring 95mm (medial-lateral) x 50mm (inferior-superior).  There is a horizontal scar on the skin surface measuring 75mm in length.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  Cut surfacesof breast show an area of scar/granulation tissue at the centre of specimen measuring 75mm (medial-lateral) x 30mm (inferior-superior) x 28mm (superficial-deep).  No further suspicious areas are identified.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - medialaspect of scar tissue; 3 to 7 - full face sections of scar tissue in the mid portion; 8 to 10 - lateral aspect of scar tissue; 11 to 18 representative sections of four quadrants (11 & 12 - outer upper quadrant; 13 & 14 - outer lower quadrant; 15 & 16 - inner lower quadrant; 17 & 18 - inner upper quadrant); 19 - nipple; 20 - skin with scar.  Please refer to attached diagram.  (SC/cc  14/4/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Vandewege): 
Sections of breast show an area of scar tissue with extensive fibrosis, foreign body reaction and fat necrosis.  The appearances are in keeping with those of previous surgery.  No residual tumour/DCIS is seen.  The resection margins are clear.  The rest of breast shows no significant abnormality.  The nipple is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast - Scar tissue and no evidence of malignancy.
