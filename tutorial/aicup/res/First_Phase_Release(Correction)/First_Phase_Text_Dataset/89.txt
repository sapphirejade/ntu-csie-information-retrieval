SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (14.2.63):


CLINICAL:
Grade 2 endometrial cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" received for frozen section and consists of two fatty nodes measuring 30 x 30 x 20mm and 15 x 10 x 10mm.  Two representative sections from the largest lymph node taken for frozen section.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - frozen section; 3 to 5 - three representative sections from the largest lymph node; 6 - small lymph node.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No tumour seen.  
Results to Dr X Prowant by Dr X Schuppenhauer at 1.25pm on 23/4/12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes + ovaries + cervix" consists of a uterus with bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries attached, weighing 77.2g.  The uterus measures 70 x 30 x 25mm.  It has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervixmeasures 30 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning there is an exophytic, tan and friable endometrial tumour located in the fundus and involving the anterior and posterior uterine walls.  It measures 30 x 15 x 7mm anteriorly and 30 x 20 x 7mm posteriorly.  The tumour measures up to 10mm thick where the uterine wall is 20mm thick.  The tumouris located 10mm from the serosal surface.  The right fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and up to 5mm in maximum diameter.  Close to the fimbria there is a cyst measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm; this contains thin fluid.  The right ovary measures 17 x 15 x 8mm and is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 80mm in length and up to 5mm in maximum diameter.  A cyst lesion is identified close to the fimbria measuring 35 x 30 x 30mm; it contains thin fluid.  The left ovary measures 20 x 20 x 10mm and is unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one LS of the posterior face of the uterus; 4 & 5 - two representative sections of tumour with posterior and myometrium; 6 to 8 - one LS of the posterior surface of the uterus; 9 & 10 - two representative sections of tumour with anterior and myometrium; 11 - right cornu; 12 - left cornu; 13 - rightparametrial tissue; 14 - left parametrial tissue; 15 - right fimbrial with cyst; 16 - one representative section of the right ovary and one representative sectionof the fallopian tube with the cyst; 17 - one representative section of the fimbrial with cyst; 18 - TS of the fallopian tube withtwo representative sections of the cyst; 19 - one representative section of the left ovary.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node 2" consists of an irregular piece of fat tissue 50 x 20 x 10mm.  Twolymph nodes are identified measuring 10 and 35mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one bisected lymph node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 20mm and containing a lymph node 50 x 10 x 10mm.  The lymph node is bisected and embedded in blocks 1 and 2.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node" consists of a fatty node measuring 50 x 10 x 10mm.  Specimen bisected and embedded in 2 blocks.  
  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac nodes" consists of a very fatty lymph node 30 x 25 x 10mm.  AE 4 blocks. 
  
G.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue 50 x 20 x 10mm.  No lymph nodes are identified macroscopically.   AE 4 blocks.  (DE/ta 26/6/62) 
 
  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Calvino):
A.   Sections show two fatty lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen. 
B.   Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.  The tumour shows some squamous and also some mucinous differentiation .  Tumour invades greater than 50% through the myometrium.  The maximum depth of myometrial invasion is measured at 9mm where total myometrial thickness is 15mm. There is some adenomyosis in the myometrium and some of the tumour within myometrium may be involving pre-existing adenomyosis.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections confirm the presence of right and left paratubal cysts.  The fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.  
C.   Sections show two lymph nodes.  A very small number of tumour cells is identified in the subcapsular sinus of one of the nodes very focally.  One of the nodes has also some benign glandular inclusions.  
D.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
E.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour isseen. 
F.   Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
G.   Sections show four fatty lymph nodes.  There are benign glandular inclusions in two of the nodes but no tumour is seen. (ec) 
 
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr X Rotstein.

DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2). 
B.   Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deepmyometrial invasion. 
C.   Left external iliac lymph node 2:  Very focal tumour in one node (1/2).
D.   Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/1). 
E.   Right common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1). 
F.   Right external iliac lymph node.  No tumour (0.1).
G.   Right obturator lymph nodes.  No tumour (0/4). 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (14.2.63):
B.  Immunostains for mismatch repair enzymes have been performed as requested.
MLH1:   Preserved nuclear staining.
PMS2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH2:   Preserved nuclear staining.
MSH6:   Preserved nuclear staining.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI).
