HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Bowel, colon, rectum, peritoneal disease.  Advanced ovarian Ca.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SMALL BOWEL, COLON, RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Three segments of small bowel and segment of large bowel, all extensively involved by a mucinous tumour deposit.  There are also multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue and separate pieces of tumour.  The first segment of small bowel measures 420mm in length with a maximum diameter of 35mm.  There is attached mesentery up to 30mm wide.  The serosa and mesentery is covered extensively by tumour deposits with a pale white appearance.  The serosa is partially haemorrhagic.  On opening, the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds, no discrete mass lesion identified.  Due to the nature of the specimen, the proximal and distal margins cannot be differentiated.  One margin is inked blue, the other black.

(1 margins; 2-4 TS through small bowel showing tumour deposit on peritoneum and mesentery [4 tumour block];

A second segment of bowel measures 295mm in length with a maximum diameter of 30mm.  The attached mesentery is up to 55mm wide.  The serosa is haemorrhagic and covered by a tan tumour deposit.  On opening, the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds.  No discrete mass lesion is identified.  One margin is inked black, the other blue.

5 margins; 6 TS with tumour deposit on serosa; 7 one possible node bisected;

A third segment of small bowel measuring 155mm in length with a maximum diameter of 20mm.  The serosa is haemorrhagic and covered by tan tumour deposits.  On opening, the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds.  No discrete lesions identified.  One margin inked blue, the other black.

8 margins

A segment of large bowel (?rectum) extensively involved by tumour deposit with a large mass involving the submucosa and mesentery.  It measures 740mm in length.  The large mass involving the submucosa and mesentery measures 115x110x70mm.  There is a large roughened area (resection).  This area measures 100x80mm and is inked green.  The bowel serosa is haemorrhagic.  The tumour appears confined to the submucosa and bulging the mucosa with no obvious penetration through it.  Presumed proximal margin is inked blue, presumed distal margin inked black.  On opening the specimen, there is an area consistent with right colon showing ileocaecal valve.

9 margins; 10 large bowel serosa with tumour deposit; 11&amp;amp;12 large mass through site of roughening (inked green); 13&amp;amp;14 large mass showing relationship to mucosa; 15 ileocaecal valve;

The separate pieces including tumour and fibrofatty tissue measure in aggregate 300x250x30mm.  Within the pieces is a piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum measuring 140x90x20mm, also involved by tumour.

16 section through separate tumour pieces; 17 peritoneum involved by tumour; 18 fatty tissue involved by tumour [possible omentum]).  RS (M-18/MC 21/9/2067 nh)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. X. Armour)
Sections show disseminated undifferentiated spindle cell malignant tumour comprising of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm including scattered multinucleated forms. The tumour is seen to involve mesentery, wall and submucosa of segments of small bowel and colon. In addition, there are deposits of tumour in separately submitted peritoneal fragments.

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour cells shows patchy positive staining with Cam5.2 and AE1/AE3 with no staining for calretinin, HBME-1, EMA, WT-1, CD5/6, D-240, S100 or Pax-8.  Strong staiing with p53 is seen. Very weak staining for oestrogen receptor is seen with no staining for progesterone receptor.

Comment:  The appearances are those of undifferentiated spindle cell malignant tumour.  In view of the previous history of sarcomatoid ovarian carcinoma the current recurrence is most likely a sarcomatoid carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
SMALL BOWEL, COLON, RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE:
- DISSEMINATED SPINDLE CELL MALIGNANT TUMOUR IN KEEPING WITH SARCOMATOID CARCINOMA (SEE COMMENT).
