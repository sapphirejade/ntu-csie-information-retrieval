CLINICAL:
Hx of DCIS L breast and BRAC +ve for bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction.  
Chronic sinusitis.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch superior" consists of a breast measuring 170mm (medial to lateral), 190mm (superior to inferior) and 40mm (superficial to deep margin).  There is an ellipse of overlying skin with nipple and areola complex 100 x 50mm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The anterior margin is inked blue and the posterior margin is inked black.  On sectioning the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.  
Blocks: 1 - nipple and areola complex; 2 to 13 - representative sections of four quadrants (2 to 4 - upper inner quadrant; 5 to 7 - lower inner quadrant; 8 to 10 - upper outer quadrant; 11 to 13 - lower outer quadrant).
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast stitch superior" consists of a breast measuring 180mm (medial to lateral), 200mm (superior to inferior) and 35mm (superficial to deep margin).  There is an ellipse of overlying skin with nipple and areola complex 110 x 40mm.  On the surface of the skin and in the upper outer quadrant there is a linear scar 40mm in length.  The superficial margin isinked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  Sectioning in the upper outer quadrant there is a cavity surrounded by fibrous tissue 30 x 20 x 25mm.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance. 
Blocks: 1 - nipple and areola complex; 2 to 4 - cavity; 5 to 15 - representative sections of four quadrants (5 to 7 - upper outer quadrant; 8 to 10 - lower outer quadrant; 11 & 12 - upper inner quadrant; 13 to 15 - lower inner quadrant).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Lolley):
A & B.  Sections of both breast show benign fibrocystic changes.  A cavity is present within the left breast surrounded by scar tissue, in keeping with previous surgery.  The nipples are unremarkable.  There is no other significant abnormality.  Thereis no evidence of in-situ or invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right breast - Benign fibrocystic change.
B.  Left breast - Benign fibrocystic change.  Scar tissue.
