CLINICAL:
Curettings showed grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes & ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 108g in total.  The specimen was received partly opened. The uterus measures 75 x 45 x40mm and has a smooth, granular serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and shows punctate haemorrhages. 
On sectioning, the endometrium measures less than 1mm in thickness within the body and lower segment.  An endometrial tumour is present within the fundus, measuring approximately 35 x 20 x 15mm.  The tumour appears to infiltrate to the outer half of the uterus, extending to serosa within the lowersegment.  The estimated macroscopic depth of invasion is 23 of 23mm.  Focally there is extension to the serosal surface both within the anterior and posterior uterus.  There is possible involvement of the upper cervix.  
The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  The rightfallopian tube measures 23mm in length and up to 10mm in diameter.  Paratubal cysts up to 6mm are present.  The right ovary measures  20 x 10 x 8mm and shows a 2mm surface serous cyst and an atrophic cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 25mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 19 x 11 x 6mm and has an atrophic cut surface. Both fallopian tubes appear disrupted medically (previous tubal ligation?).   
Blocks 1-5 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 6 - tumour extending to serosa anteriorly; 7 - tumour and bladder flap; 8-12 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 13 - further representative tumour posterior; 14 - representative tumour lower segment; 15 - ?tumour involving cervix; 16 - representative right ovary; 17 - representative left tube and ovary; 18 - representative right parametrium; 19 - representative left parametrium.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right fimbrial cyst", consists of a 28 x 26 x 25mm serous fluid filled cyst attached to distal fallopian tube and fimbria (16mm in length and up to 6mm indiameter). The cyst has smooth inner and outer surfaces.  
Block 1 - fallopian tube; 2-4 - cyst, TS AE. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac", consists of multiple pieces of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 50 x 40 x 15mm.  
Block 1- one lymphnode bisected; 2- one lymph node bisected; 3 - lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node bisected. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Rightobturator", consists of multiple pieces of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 55 x 55 x 15mm.  
Block 1-5 - lymph nodes. 
E.   Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of multiple pieces of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 60 x 45 x 15mm in aggregate. 
Block 1- one lymph node bisected; 2-3 - lymph nodes; 4 - one lymph node bisected; 5 - lymph nodes. 
F.   Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of multiple pieces of unoriented fibroadipose tissue 40 x 30 x 10mm.  
Block 1-2 - lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node, TS AE.
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum biopsy", consists of a 210 x 105 x 16mm piece ofunremarkable omental tissue. Representative 3 blocks.  (TO: PS;IU/ec 17.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr W Bullert)
A.  Sections show extensive grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour penetrates the full thickness of the myometrium 21mm thick.  A moderate amount of lymphvascular invasionis present.  The carcinoma extends to involve the upper endocervix.
The ectocervix, both ovaries and the left tube are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show a fimbrial cyst and an otherwise unremarkable tube.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Five lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Fourteen lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Eleven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Four lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 21mm through a wall 21mm thick.  Upper endocervical involvement present.  Moderate lymphvascular invasion present.  Thirty four (34) lymph nodes and the omentum are negative.
