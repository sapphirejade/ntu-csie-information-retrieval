CLINICAL:
Malignant large bowel obstruction.  CABG, HTN, T2DM.  Descending and sigmoid colon.  Small bowel peritoneal nodule.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled:  Sigmoid colon.
Specimen length:  250mm
Site of anterior peritoneal reflection:  Not included
Thickness of mesocolon:  90mm
Thickness of mesorectum:  Not applicable

Tumour
Location:  Proximal sigmoid colon
Relation to anterior peritoneal reflection:  Above
Description:  Circumferential ulcerated tumour comprising 30mm of bowel wall length
Maximum tumour diameter:  35mm
Perforation:  Absent
Appearance of serosa overlying tumour:  Pale and puckered
Distance of tumour to proximal cut end:  95mm
Distance of tumour to distal cut end:  150mm
Distance of tumour to circumferential margin:  25mm

Blocks
1 - proximal margin; 2 - distal margin; 3 to 5 - tumour with closest serosal surface; 6 - tumour with closest radial margin; 7 and 8 - further sections through tumour (MSI on block 7); 9 - apical lymph node; 10 and 11 - one lymph node per block bisected; 12 to 19 - lymph nodes as seen.  (TO:AP/rs 11/9/68)

B.  Specimen labelled:  Small peritoneal bowel lesion and consists of a rounded piece of pale tissue measuring 5mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.


MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr M Sirpilla):
A.

BOWEL CANCER PROFORMA

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS

Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate

Local invasion
T3	Beyond muscularis propria

Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved

Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:	15
Number of lymph nodes involved:	0

Note: There is a separate 2mm deposit of tumour in the pericolic fat, without associated lymph node tissue (A8).

N1c	Tumour deposit(s) in the subserosa, mesentery, or nonperitonealised pericolic or perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis

Lymphovascular invasion
Not seen

Perineural invasion
Not seen

Histologically confirmed distant metastases
MX	Cannot be assessed histologically

Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block A7)
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

Summary  TNM 8th Edition
pT3	   N1c	   MX        R0

B. Sections show a nodular area of fibrosis with dystrophic calcification. There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS
A. Sigmoid colon:
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading pericolic fat, margins clear
- 2mm nodule of tumour in pericolic fat
- 15 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy
- pT3 N1c MX

B. Small bowel peritoneal lesion: fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, no evidence of malignancy
