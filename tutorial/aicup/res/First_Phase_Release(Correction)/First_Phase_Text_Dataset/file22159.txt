HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Colon (right), rectum, omentum, fallopian tubes, bilateral ovaries, peritoneal disease.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;RECTUM, RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  A cholecystectomy specimen 80mm in size up to 30mm in width with a smooth serosal surface. AN enterocolic resection measuring up to 80mm in length with attached mesocolic fat up to 50mm in thickness within which is a firm 25mm nodule. A length of large bowel which tapers at one end, 200mm in length 30mm in opened circumference with attached 70mm of pericolic fat.  A fallopian tube (40x5mm) with attached ovary(20x8x5mm).   Another separate fallopian tube (45x5mm) with attached ovary (20x10x5mm) with attached peritoneum (190x70x10mm) with patchy firm areas. There is another separate piece of peritoneum (120x90x10mm) with patchy firm areas. And a piece of omentum (270x170x18mm).

(1  ovary and fallopian tube; 2  the ovary and fallopian tube with attached peritoneum; 3  peritoneal firm areas attached to the ovary; 4  sampled firm areas on the separate piece of peritoneum; 5  stapled margins of enterocolic anastomosis; 6  sampled section of anastomosis; 7  firm nodule in mesocolic tissue of enterocolic anastomosis; 8  stapled margin of large bowel; 9  LS of tapered end large bowel; 10&amp;amp;11  sampled sections of nodules at border mesenteric and antimesenteric surface of large bowel; 12  bisected omental nodule; 13  omental roll; 14  cystic duct, cystic duct lymph node and neck; 15  body and fundus).  RS (M-15/MY 21/11/2067 km).

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr N Bohannan)
The sections of the fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
Section of the separate fragments of peritoneum show fibrofatty tissue including some skeletal muscle fibres.  There is a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with desmoplastic stromal reaction and infiltration of carcinoma into underlying fatty tissue and fibrous tissue.
Sections of the segment of bowel with enterocolic anastomosis show unremarkable appearing bowel.  In the adjacent mesentery/mesocolon there is a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with an adjacent lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  A focus of serosal involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma is also seen.
Sections of the segment of large bowel show unremarkable appearing mucosa.  In the mesocolon and infiltrating into the muscularis propria are deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Section of the omentum shows a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within an omental lymph node and extension into perinodal omental adipose tissue.
Sections of the gallbladder and cystic duct lymph node are unremarkable.
Comment:  There are deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma present.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
