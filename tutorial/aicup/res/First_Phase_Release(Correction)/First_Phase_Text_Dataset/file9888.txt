HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
CRC peritonectomy.
Additional information obtained from the operation report (22/2/66): Operation description - huge Rt krukenberg tumour (++++ and left smaller krukenberg ++).  Peritoneal mets.  Tumour nodules taken of uterus, rectum and bladder, preserving rectum, uterus and bladder, omentectomy.  Right diaphragm strip.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;BILATERAL OVARIES, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, KRUKENBERG, BILATERAL TUBES&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple pieces of pieces :

There is an unoriented excision of lobulated  fatty tissue, 33x80x15mm.  It appears consistent with omentum.  There are no abnormalities on the surface.  Sectioning reveals the focus of pale firm tissue within the fatty parenchyma, 17mm in maximum extent.  In addition two possible lymph nodes are present.

(1&amp;amp;2 sections from the firm deposit; 3 two possible lymph node)

Also within the specimen jar is a large unoriented piece of possible peritoneum, 280x205x10mm.  One surface is smooth and shiny and the other surface is roughened and fatty. There are innumerable firm deposits on the smooth surface, 2-8mm in size.

(4-6 RS of presumed peritoneal deposit)

Also within the specimen jar is a piece of tissue, which contains two abnormal ovaries and two attached fallopian tubes.  The larger ovary is presumed to be the right ovary (according to the operation report).  It measures 210x120x80mm.  It comprises of solid areas, the largest measuring 90x60x50mm.  In addition there are multiloculated cystic areas, containing brown serous fluid, the largest measures 110x90x100mm.  The fallopian tube attached to this ovary measures 90mm in length and 5-18mm in diameter.  The second ovary is attached to the structure by a band of fibrous tissue.  It measures 62x35x18mm.  There are smaller cystic structures up to 25mm in diameter and the remainder of this presumed left ovary is solid. The attached presumed left fallopian tube is 58mm in length and 7-25mm in diameter. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable. The aggregate weight of these joint structures, left cystic fluid that escapes through opening the specimen is 610g.

(7&amp;amp;8 longitudinally quadrisected fimbrial end of right fallopian tube; 9 four RS TS of right fallopian tube)

Most of the cyst contents and solid areas of the right ovary appear necrotic.

(10-12 RS of right ovary; 13&amp;amp;14 longitudinally quadrisected left fallopian tube; 15 RS TS of left fallopian tube; 16-18 RS of left ovary)

In addition within the specimen jar there are numerous unoriented pieces of fibroadipose tissue, 10-210mm in size and 220x180x15mm in aggregate.  Most of the tissues appear to have a smooth and shiny surface, consistent with peritoneum. The largest of these tissues contains possible peritoneal deposit 2-4mm in size. The separate small tissue also appear to contain possible peritoneal deposit, 2mm in size.

(19 RS of the largest separate piece of peritoneum; 20 two RS of smaller unorientated pieces of peritoneum). RS (M-20)

B.  &amp;quot;WOUND NODULE&amp;quot;. Consists of an unoriented excision of fibroadipose tissue, 30x25x16mm.  There is a small area of smooth and shiny surface, consistent with peritoneum.  The deep aspect is mixed fibrosis and adipose tissue. The roughened surface is arbitrarily inked blue and the specimen is sectioned.  Sectioning also reveals the presence of probable muscle and suture material.

(1&amp;amp;2 central TS; 3 both enface ends).  AE (M-1/LK/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. T. Khachatoorian)
A.  Sections show disseminated metastatic adenocarcinoma with areas of necrosis, in keeping with origin from a colorectal primary involving both ovaries, omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments.  The fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.  The left ovary also shows a haemorrhagic corpus luteum.  A reactive lymph node is also identified within the omentum.  Lymphovascular invasion by the carcinoma is noted in the peritoneal deposits and in the omentum.

B.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle tissue with evidence of previous surgery with foreign body granulomatous reaction.  Scattered entrapped tubules of probable mesothelial origin are present.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
BILATERAL OVARIES, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, BILATERAL TUBES:
- DISSEMINATED COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA.

WOUND NODULE:
-  FIBROSIS AND FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMATOUS REACTION
