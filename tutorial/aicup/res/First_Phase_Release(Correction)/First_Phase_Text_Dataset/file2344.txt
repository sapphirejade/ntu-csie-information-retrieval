CLINICAL:
Bilateral breast Ca.  Advanced breast cancer on Tamoxifen.   Thickened endometrium.
Further history from Dr Macina (7.8.2065): Imaging of the right breast shows no definite primary tumour, however, extensive right axillary lymph node involvement is confirmed (?metastases from contralateral breast tumour).
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right breast tissue plus axillary dissection&amp;quot;, consists of a mastectomy specimen measuring 185 x 135 x 25mm, with an overlying ellipse of skin measuring 160 x 84mm.  There is attached axillary tissue measuring 80 x 75 x 25mm.  The complete specimen weighs 265g.  The nipple measures 14mm in diameter andis situated 64mm from the medial skin apex and 27mm from the inferior skin edge.  The overlying ellipse of skin appears unremarkable.  The superior margin is inked blue, the inferior margin is inked red, and the deep margin is inked black.  On sectioning, there is a very firm and calcified tumour situated 40mm from the nipple at roughly the 10 o&amp;#8217;clock position.  The tumour measures roughly 18 x 15 x 14mm.  The tumour is 8mm from the deep margin, 28mm from theinferior margin, 30mm from the superior margin, and 16mm deep to the skin.  The remaining breast parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.  There are few small calcified areas palpable in the region deep to the nipple.  Multiple lymph nodesare identified in the axillary tissue.  RS.
Blocks: 1 &amp;#8211; representative nipple; 2 &amp;#8211; tissue deep to nipple; 3 and 4 &amp;#8211; representative right upper quadrant; 5 and 6 &amp;#8211; representative right lower quadrant; 7 and8 &amp;#8211; representative left upper quadrant; 9 and 10 &amp;#8211; representative left lower quadrant; 11 to 14 &amp;#8211; tissue adjacent to calcified tumour; 15 to 19 &amp;#8211; tissue deep to nipple (region of palpable calcifications); 20 &amp;#8211; four lymph nodes; 21 &amp;#8211; two lymph nodes; 22 &amp;#8211; single lymph node, bisected; 23 &amp;#8211; RS single presumed involved lymph node (25mm in maximum dimension); 24 &amp;#8211; single lymph node, bisected; 25 &amp;#8211; single lymph node, bisected; 26 &amp;#8211; RS single presumed involved lymph node (43mm in maximum dimension); 27 &amp;#8211; RS presumed involved lymph node (33mm in maximum dimension).
Additional tissue embedded 1 June 2065 and 2 June 2065 following decalcification.  Blocks: 28 &amp;#8211; RS directly lateral to calcified tumour (decalcified); 29 and 30 &amp;#8211; calcified tumour (decalcified); 31 and 32 &amp;#8211; RS directly medial to calcified tumour (decalcified).

(TO: JB; JB/rt 7.7.65)
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left breast tissue and axillary dissection&amp;quot;, consists of a mastectomy specimen measuring 210 x 150 x 50mm, with overlying ellipse of skin measuring 235 x 13mm.  There is axillary tail measuring 100 x 110 x 45mm, including an attached segment of muscle measuring 100 x 40 x 35mm.  The nipple measures 15mm in diameter and is situated 110mm from the medial skin apex of skin and 55mm from the inferior skin edge.  The complete specimen weighs 483g.  There are multiple firm, palpable nodules scattered over the skin surface.  On sectioning, there is a multifocal tumour which diffusely infiltrates though the fibroadipose breast tissue.  The tumour involves the skin and appears to abut the deep and superior margins.  The tumour is 4mm from the inferior margin.  Accurate assessment of the full extent of the tumour is challenging given its diffuse nature, but it appear to measure up to 110mm in maximum dimension (medial to lateral).  The bulk of the tumour is directly deep to the nipple and measures 85mm from superior to inferior.  The axillary tissue appears to be one solid, adherent mass of lymph nodes/tumour; individual lymph nodes are largely not identifiable.  RS.

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr V Hartman)
A.  The right breast has been extensively sampled. There is an incidental 3.3mm grade 3 invasive carcinoma of the breast associated with multifocal lymphovascular space invasion, perineural growth and extensive axillary lymph node metastases (9/12 axillary lymph nodes involved).
Invasive carcinoma:
Site: Left breast (blocks A16, A33, A34).
Type: Invasive carcinoma of no special type.
The carcinoma consists of infiltrative highly atypical malignant trabeculae and cords with an associated mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.
Invasive tumour size: Approximately 3.3mm.
Grade (ModifiedBloom &amp;amp; Richardson): 3
Tubules:      Nuclei: 3     Mitoses: X    Mitotic rate:      Up to 3/10hpf.
(Note: there is insufficient tumour for a complete mitotic count. Based on the tumour morphology, very high ki-67 and comparison with the contralateral breast tumour, this tumour has been assigned as grade 3 for mitoses).
Lymphovascular invasion: Present (multifocal).
Focal perineural growth.

DCIS component:
Not identified.
Excision Margins:
Invasive component:
Clear of margins.

Receptors (Block A33):
ER:  	POSITIVE
75% of nuclei stained
Predominant intensity of staining: Moderate tostrong.
PR:  	NEGATIVE.
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): NEGATIVE.
HER SISH:  Performed at DHM, MORUYA DISTRICT HOSPITAL Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 index: Approximately 60%.
E-cadherin: Positive.
Nipple: The nipple shows no significant abnormality. Scattered fungal elements are noted within the superficial nipple skin.
LCIS / ALH: Not identified.
Miscellaneous: The non-neoplastic breast tissue shows a spectrumof proliferative changes including columnar cell change/hyperplasia, florid epithelial hyperplasia, multiple foci of sclerosing adenosis, papillary apocrine metaplasia, fibrocystic change, fibroadenomatoid change and scattered microcalcifications. In areas, the columnar cell change shows papillary type tufting, in keeping with atypical ductal hyperplasia (clear of margins A32). A single large duct in A42 shows partial involvement by atypical ductal hyperplasia which approaches, but falls short of definite, low grade papillary intraduct carcinoma. There is a calcified 15mm fibroadenoma.
Axillary/other nodes:
Number of axillary lymph nodes examined: Twelve.
Number of axillary lymph nodes involved by tumour: Nine (9/12).
Number of axillary nodes with metastases &amp;gt;2.0mm: Nine (up to 16mm).
Extranodal spread: Present (up to 1.6mm).
