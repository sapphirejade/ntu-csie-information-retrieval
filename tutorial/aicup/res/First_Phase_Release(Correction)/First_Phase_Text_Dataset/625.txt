CLINICAL:
PMB.  Hysteroscopy D&C.   serous adenocarcinoma.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Cervix + uterus + tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with bilateral tubes and ovaries attached.  It weighs 64g.  The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 30mm.  The cervix measures 13 x 25mm.  The serosal surface has three small fibroids ranging from 1 to 7mm.  The mucosal surface of the cervix is tan and soft.  The endometrium has a maximum thickness of 1mm and has small polypoid lesions measuring 5 and 7mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 12mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 35 x 5 x 5mm.  The fimbria is present.  The right ovary is 15 x 15 x 10mm.  The external surface is smooth and the cut surface is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube is 30 x 5 x 5mm and the fimbria is present. The left ovary is 25 x 15 x 5mm.  The external surface is smooth and the cut surfaceis unremarkable.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one full LS of anterior and body and cervix; 4 to 6 - anterior end of myometrium; 7 to 9 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 to 12 - three representative sections of posterior and myometrium; 13 - right parametrial tissue; 14 - left parametrial tissue; 15 - right ovary AE; 16 - left ovary AE; 17 - two LS right fimbria; 18 - right fallopian tube; 19 - two LS left fimbria; 20 - left fallopian tube.  
(ZS/ta 12/6/62) 
Blocks:  21to 25 - further anterior corpus; 26 to 30 - further posterior corpus.  (MA/mm 12.7.62) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr R Mosher - 12.10.2062)
The endometrium has been examined in its entirety. The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality. The endometrium is weakly proliferative/inactive and shows foci of polypoid cystic atrophy. The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis and there is a single hyalinised leiomyoma. The bilateral ovaries contain scattered epithelial inclusions and the fallopian tubes show no significant histologic abnormality. No residual in situ or invasive malignancy is identified. 
Representative slides seen with Dr R Profera. 


DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus (including cervix) and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes:
Weakly proliferative/inactive endometrium with foci of polypoid cystic atrophy.
No evidence ofin situ or invasive malignancy.
