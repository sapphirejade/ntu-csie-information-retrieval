CLINICAL:
R pelvic mass.  10L of drainage of (illegible) content.  71 year old woman, massive right ovarian cyst, benign in appearance with normal tumour markers. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a cystic ovary 285 x 55 x 25mm with attached tube 90 x 6mm.  Outer surface is smooth.  The cyst contains brown liquid and it has a smooth inner surface.  Two representative for FS. 
Blocks 1 & 2- FS; 3-12 - representative sections; 13 - fallopian tube; 14 to 25 - extra sections.  
FROZEN SECTION:   Benign serous cystadenoma.
Result to Dr Forss by Dr P Teller at 12:40pm on 23.10.13. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix and left fallopian tube and ovary", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and left ovary weighing 83g in total. The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness. There is a polypoid endometrial mass posteriorly 35 x 10 x 7mm.  The myometrium is 23mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium contains one fibroid 20mm in maximum dimension.  The fibroid has a whorled grey cut surface with no necrosis (block 5).  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The fallopian tube is 60mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  There is a unilocular cyst 20mm in maximum dimension adjacent to the ovary (block 12). The cyst is filled with clear fluid and has  smooth outer and inner surfaces.   Blocks 1-5 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 6-10 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10 & 11 - all of the endometrial polypoid mass; 12 - left ovary and the adjacent cyst; 13 - left fallopian tube; 14 to 25 - further sections of ovary.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of fatty tissue 115 x 45 x 7mm.  No nodules are identified.  Blocks 1-3 - random sections.  (TO: KF;VH/ec 26.12.63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Finnel)
A.  Sections show a borderline mucinous tumourwith moderate atypical epithelial proliferation.  The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of invasion.
B.  The ectocervix shows transitional metaplasia.  The endocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and has a large benign endometrial polyp.  The myometrium shows a leiomyoma.  There is a paratubal cyst.  The ovary and tube are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The omentum shows no significant abnormality.
COMMENT:
A.  The ovarian tumour is positive for CK7, CK20 and CDX2.  Spread from an appendiceal primary cannot be excluded. 
DIAGNOSIS:
Borderline mucinous tumour of the right ovary (SEE COMENT).
