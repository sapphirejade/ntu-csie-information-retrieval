HISTORY:
For peritonectomy. HX of colorectal ca. 
Frozen section of gastric antrum.
Colon cancer peritonectomy. Rectosigmoid, peritoneal nodules, omentum, small bowel. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A. "ANTRUM BIOPSY". Two pieces of tissue, measuring  2mm, 8mm in maximum dimension. All embedded for frozen section. 
F/S:  "No evidence of malignancy". Reported by Dr F Sacks 23.3.64.
(1 frozen section). AE 
B. "OMENTUM, RECTOSIGMOID, SMALL BOWEL". Several pieces of tissue;
A piece of rectosigmoid measuring 205mm in length. The anterior peritoneal reflection margin is seen 13mm from the distal resection margin. There is an area 60mm from the distal resection margin where the mucosa appears partially flattened and the wall slightly thickened ?previous anastomosis site. A few small polyps are identified in the distal end of the specimen up to 3mm in maximum dimension. All the polyps have been confined to the mucosa. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat from 2-4mm. 
(1 resection margins; 2-4 area ?anastomosis; 5 small polyps; 6 ?lymph nodes). RS (M-6).
A small length of small bowel measuring 28mm in length. The mucosa appears unremarkable. In the mesentery there is a small cream area identified which appears fibrous in nature. 
(7 LS of entire length of small bowel; 8&9 representative fibrous area in mesentery). RS (M-3).
Four separate fragments of cream firm tissue are identified from 10-24mm. Each piece is bisected and reveals a cream fibrous tissue throughout. 
(10-14 all four nodules embedded [13&14 paired]). RS (M-5).
A piece of omentum 390x170x15mm. No suspicious are identified. RS (M-16).
MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr F Bigusiak)
A.  Sections show smooth muscle and adjacent fibrous tissue with mild chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections through the rectosigmoid show an area of fibrosis in the mesentery presumably related to previous surgery.  An early mucosal sessile serrated adenoma is also present. No residual tumour is seen. Four local lymph nodes examined show reactive changes. 
Sections through the segment of smallbowel show a small desmoid tumour (fibromatosis) attached to the muscularis propria extending into mesentery. Detached fragments of desmoid tumour are also present within the container. Scattered reactive lymph nodes are present adjacent to the desmoid tumour. Sections through the omentum show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of residual carcinoma. Due to fragmentation of the fibromatosis it is not possible to accurately assess its resection margins.
COMMENT:
In the presence of history of colorectal cancer and intraabdominal desmoid (fibromatosis) investigation for Gardner's syndrome is recommended. 
DIAGNOSIS:
ANTRUM BIOPSY:  
 - FIBROSIS AND SMOOTH MUSCLE WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. 
OMENTUM, RECTOSIGMOID AND SMALL BOWEL: 
 - SMALL DESMOID TUMOUR (INTRABDOMINAL FIBROMATOSIS) ATTACHED TO SMALL BOWEL WALL AND SEPARATE FRAGMENTS OF DESMOID TUMOUR. NO RESIDUAL CARCINOMA SEEN.
