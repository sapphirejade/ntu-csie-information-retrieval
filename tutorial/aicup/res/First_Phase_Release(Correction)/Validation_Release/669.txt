DR Roy ANDY Yurchiak
Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Anterior resection.  Re-excision of previously anastomosed sigmoid colon for recurrence.  Small mesenteric nodule along with a lymph node excised.  Also proximal and distal anastomosis donut - for histopathology.?Recurrence.  Hyperthyroidism.  Sigmoid Ca.  High cholesterol.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Low anterior resection" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 50mm in length x 35 x 35mm in maximum diameter.  The serosal surface appears smooth and shiny.  On opening the mucosa appears unremarkable.  One margin is inked blue and the other black.  No mass is identified in the mesocolon or large bowel.  
Blocks:1 - black margin; 2 - blue margin; 3 to 6 - representative bowel; 7 to 12 - lymph nodes.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a stapled colonic donut measuring 20 x 15 x 8mm in maximum dimension.  Representative in 2 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Proximal donut" consists of a stapled colonic donut measuring 20 x 20 x 6mm.  Representative in 2 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Carthew):
A, B, C.  Sections of the large bowel show focal serosal adhesions but no other abnormality.  A few small unremarkable lymph nodes are identified and the donuts show no obvious abnormality.  No evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Rectum plus donuts:  No significant abnormality.   
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr M Chudy, 2/10/2063):
The entire specimen is re-examined by Dr M Lievano and Dr Narelle TALAYUMPTEWA.  No macroscopic/serosal lesion is identified in the specimen A (low anterior resection).  No tumour recurrence is seen.  Two additional blocks (A13 and A14) are taken near the blue inked margin.  Sections of these blocks show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: (Reported by Dr M Lauridsen 22/11/63)
The specimen was examined by the surgical registrar who found a soft 10mm serosal nodule.  This proved on histology to be extravasated mucus with a surrounding rim of fibrous tissue.  The origin of this extravasated mucus is uncertain, but a ruptured mucocele from some other site should be considered.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
