CLINICAL:
Interval debulking of ovarian cancer.  Ca125 >3000 but down to 27 post 4 cycles of carbo-taxol.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix, left ovary, bilateral tubes" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and left ovary, weighing 81g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 40 x 30mm and has a ragged, haemorrhagic serosal surface.  Small amounts of omental tissue are adherentto the anterior and posterior serosa.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and shows small punctate haemorrhages.  On opening the endometrium measures <1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 12mm.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and is dilated laterally to 14mm.  The left ovary measures 40 x 28 x 23mm and shows a 15mm surface cyst.  On sectioning the left ovary has a nodular white cutsurface with a 10mm haemorrhagic cyst.  The right fallopian tube measures 42mm in length and up to 9mm in diameter. 
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 - further representative anterior body; 5 to 7 -full LS posterior body and cervix; 8 - further representative posterior body; 9 to 11 - representative left ovary; 12 - representative left tube; 13 - representative right tube; 14 - representative left parametrium; 15 - representative right parametrium.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Transverse colon nodule" consists of multiple pieces of nodular fibroadipose tissue,30 x 20 x 5mm in aggregate.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "SM bowel nodule" consists of two nodular pieces of fibroadiopose tissue, 6 and 12mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block (largest nodule bisected).  
D.  Specimen labelled "Tail of omentum" consists of a nodular firm piece of fibroadipose tissue, 50 x 20 x 10mm.  TS AE 2 blocks.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Descending colon nodule" consists of multiple pieces of fibroadipose tissue, 20 x 20 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Caecal nodule" consists of a 3mm piece of fibroadipose tissue.  AE 1 block.
G.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of two piecesof nodular omental tissue, 210 x 90 x 10mm in aggregate.  
Blocks:  1 to 2 - representative; 3 - tumour reserved block.  
(TO: OF; SZ/mm 24.1.62) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Allevato) 
A.  Sections show scattered small groups and single malignant cells within the left ovary consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma.  Extensive chemotherapyeffect is present.
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable. The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Both tubes are unremarkable.
B, C & E.  Sections show small deposits of poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with chemotherapy affected serous carcinoma.
D & F.  Sections show no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Sections show poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving the left ovary, omentum, transverse colon, small bowel and descending colon.
