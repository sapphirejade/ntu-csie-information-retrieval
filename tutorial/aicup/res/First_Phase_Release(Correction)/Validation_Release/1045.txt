TLH/BSO/bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy/peritoneal washings/omental biopsy for endometrial Ca.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 80.1g.  The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 25mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On opening the uterus there is a roughened nodular area in the posterior body measuring 35 x 25mm x 7mm thick.  On sectioning the roughened nodule does not appear to penetrate through to the myometrium.  A portion of tumour was also found detached in the cavity; this piece measures 23 x 12 x 5mm.  There are two fibroids found in the anterior body myometrium, one measuring 8 x 7 x 10mm, the other 5 x 5 x 5mm.
The right fallopian tube measures 30mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 20mm in length and 4mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 11 x 9 x 30mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to - full LS of the anterior bodyand cervix including the two fibroids; 4 - further section through tumour in anterior uterus; 5 - fibroid; 6 to 8 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 9 & 10 - further sections through tumour; 11 & 12 - tumour found separately in cavity; 13 - right fallopian tube; 14 - right ovary; 15 -left fallopian tube; 16 - left ovary.  There are no designatedtumour bank blocks.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph nodes" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 30 x 30 x 5mm.  It contains two lymph nodes 20 x 10 x 5mm and 20 x 5 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 30 x 25 x 5mm. Three lymph nodes are identified, up to 30 x 10mm.. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - LSof one lymph node; 3 - two lymph nodes.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac" consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 40 x 30 x 10mm.  Thyere are three lymph nodes, up to 10 x 15mm.  
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - lymph node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator" consists of a piece of adipose tissue 30 x 25 x 5mm containing lymph nodes up to 50mm in main diameter. 
Blocks:  1 - five lymph nodes; 2 & 3 - one lymph node bisected.
F.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 90 x 90 x 15mm.  No lesions or nodules are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks (TO: GY; XG/bl 4/9/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Fencl):
A. Sections show a grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour consists of glands and papillary structures but also has a significant solid component, over 50% of the tumour.  Some squamous differentiation is also noted.  The tumour has an exophytic profile but there is considered to be superficial myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 4mm out of total myometrial thickness of 17mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  There is no cervical involvement.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium and there is also prominent adenomyosis in the myometrium.  Some of the superficial adenomyosis is involved by tumour.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.No tumour is seen.  
C.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
F.  One lymph node was identified in the random sections and this is unremarkable.  The other sections of omentum are also unremarkable.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of endometrium with less than 50% myometrial invasion, Stage 1A.
B.  Left external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).  
C.  Left obturator lymph node:  No tumour (0/3).
D.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/3). 
E.  Right obturator nodes:  No tumour (0/6).    
F.  Omentum:  No tumour (0/1).
