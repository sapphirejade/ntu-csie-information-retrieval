CLINICAL:
Left hood wire localized breast calcification, surgical wide local excision.  Deep margin close towire distally, deep margin re-excised intraoperatively and sutured to specimen.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Long stitch lateral medium stitch skin superficial left breast lesion", consists of a mass of breast tissue with two sutures.  The two sutures had  been displaced and the specimen was re-orientated following a discussion with Dr Lon GRAYDON over the phone.  The specimen weighs 56g and measures 55mm from medial to lateral, 25mm from superior to inferior, 65mm from superficial to deep.  An ellipse of skin measuring 25 x 10mm is present on the superficial surface.  Two hookwires are inserted from the superficial aspect of the specimen.  The lateral surface is inked red, the superior surface is inked blue and the inferior surface is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superficial to deep into twelve slices, slice one superficial slice twelve deep.  On the cut surface a previous biopsy cavity is noted in slices three to eight, filled with foreign body material.  A clip is noted on the x-ray but was displaced during slicing.  The cut surface of the breast tissue is fatty; no mass is seen.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - LS superficial margin; 3 and 4 - slice two; 5 and 6 - slice three; 7 and 8 - slice four; 9 and 10 - slice five; 11 and 12 - slice six; 13 and 14 - slice seven; 15 to 17 - slice eight; 18 to 20 - slice nine; 21 to 23 - slice ten; 24 and 25 - slice eleven; 26 and 27 - LS of slice 12 deep margin.  Multiple pieces in 27 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by DrW Dilts):
Sections show breast tissue with a previous biopsy site associated with adjacent fat necrosis.  There is sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, and columnar cell change without atypia associated with luminal coarse calcification, and some moderate and florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type.  Stromal calcification is also present.  There is also a single small focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia; this is in the centre of the specimen and is well away from all excision margins (block 9).  There is no in-situ or invasive malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast lesion:  Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell change without atypia, apocrine metaplasia and epithelial hyperplasia of usual type.
