CLINICAL:
Lung cancer.  Left upper lobe.  Hilar nodes. AP window nodes.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left upper lobe", consists of a left upper lobe 160g in weight.  It consists of a left upper lobe 140mm superior to inferior, 20mm medial to lateral and 130mm anterior to posterior. There is an area of pleural puckering at the anterolateral aspect of the specimen and a pleural plaque at the apex of the specimen. On sectioning and 25mm from the surgical bronchial margin there is an infiltrative tan tumour measuring 32 x 20 x 30mm. The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  Block 1 - bronchial resection margin; 2- vascular resection margin; 3 & 4 - hilar lymph nodes; 5 - one hilar lymph node; 6-10 - tumour (10 - reserved block); 11 & 12 - representative lung; 13 -  one intralobar lymph node; 14 - representative sections from the apical pleural plaques.
B.  Specimen labelled "Left hilar lymph node", consists of three fragments of lymph node ranging from 5-15mm. AE 2 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left upper AP window", consists of two lymph nodes 15 and 25mm.  Block 1 - one lymph node; 2 - one lymph node. (YQ/ec 21.12.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Y Vallance): 
A.Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe with a dense central scar and extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour has a lipidic growth pattern at the advancing edge of the tumour.  No definite lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  The tumour measures approximately 35mm across and lies well clear of the bronchial resection margin. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura.  Five of seven (5/7) lymph nodes show metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The apical pleura containsa benign pleural plaque and the remainder of the lung parenchyma showsmild emphysematous change.  
B.   Five of the five (5/5) lymph nodes identified show metastatic adenocarcinoma.
C.  One of the two (1/2) lymph nodes identified show metastatic adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - C.   Left upper lobe lung and lymph nodes:
-    Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, size approximately 35mm. 
-    Bronchial resection margin clear of tumour.
-    No invasion ofvisceral pleura.
-    Eleven positive lymph nodes.  
-   Stage:  T2a N2 MX.
