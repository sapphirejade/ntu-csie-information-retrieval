CLINICAL:
Adenocarcinoma on cone biopsy. Cervical cancer - adenocarcinoma.  Melanoma age 20.  Methadone.   
MACROSCOPIC:
A.   Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus and attached cervix weighing 91g in total. The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and appears mildly nodular at the os.  A vaginal cuff measuring10mm anterior and 12mm posterior is identified. The anterior endocervical margin is inked blue and the posterior is inked black. The cut surface reveals a cream area in the posterior endocervix measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.  The lesion appears to extend 15mm over a total wall thickness 17mm and is well clear of the vaginal cuff margin.  Otherwise the endometrium is 1mm thick over a total wall thickness 20mm and the myometrium appears unremarkable.  
Blocks 1-8 - entire anterior cervix embedded from left to right; 9-17 - entire posterior cervix embedded from left to right; 18-20 - further full face of anterior uterus; 21-23 - further full face of posterior uterus; 24 - further cream area posteriorly. Please refer to attached diagram. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node", consists of a fragmented piece of fatty tissue 55mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 2-22mm.  Block 1- lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 & 4- one lymph node serially sectioned. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node", consists of a piece of haemorrhagic fatty tissue 60mm.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified from 6-30mm. Block 1- lymph nodes; 2 & 3- one lymph node serially sectioned. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Right common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm.  Multiple lymph nodes from 7-20mm are identified. AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fatty tissue 25mm.  One lymph node 13mm is identified.  Block 1 - lymph node bisected; 2 - remainder of tissue AE. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece of fragmented fatty tissue 55mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified from 2-18mm.  AE 3 blocks.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node", consists of a piece offragmented haemorrhagic tissue 45mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 5-25mm.  Block 1- lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 3 & 4- one lymph node serially sectioned.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Tables)
A.  The cervix has been embedded in its entirety. There is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, arising on a background of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), CIN 3 and Human Papilloma virus infection. 
The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 13.5mm and extends up to 26mm in length along the cervical canal and focally into thelower uterine segment. The tumour is clear from the ectocervical margin and is 1.1mm from the deep margin (block A15). AIS and CIN 3 are clear of margins. There are scattered foci of lymphovascular space and perineural invasion. 
The endometrium shows changes consistent with a placental site nodule. The lower uterine segment endometrium shows focal AIS and CIN 3. The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis and a benign leiomyoma. 
Representative slides seen with Dr P Moisey.
B.  Sections of the six right obturator lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/6). 
C.  Sections of the seven left obturator lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/7). 
D.  Sections of the right common iliac lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
E.  Sections of the left common iliac lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
F.  Sections of the seven right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/7).
G.  Sections of the seven left external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/7).
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus and cervix:
Moderately differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma, depth 13.5mm, length 26mm. Carcinoma is 1.1mm from the deep marginand is clear of the ectocervical margin. 
Adenocarcinoma in situ, CIN 3 and HPV effect, clear of margins.
Placental site nodule. 
Adenomyosis and leiomyoma.

B.  Right obturator lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/6). 

C.  Left obturator lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/7).

D.  Right common iliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/1).

E.  Left common iliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/1).

F.  Right external iliac lymph nodes: No evidence of malignancy (0/7).

G.  Left external iliac lymph nodes: No evidence of malignancy (0/7).
