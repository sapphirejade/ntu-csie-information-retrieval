CLINICAL:
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.   Right abdominal nodule developed after diagnostic ascitic drainage 2062. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 205g intotal. The uterus measures 72 x 50 x 28mm.  Anteriorly the serosal surface of the uterus is slightly roughened over a 25 x 11mm area (inked blue).  Posteriorly there are two nodular tumour deposits over the serosal surface of the uterus 22 x 20 x 8mm (right side) and 10 x 10 x 7mm (left side).  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 16mm in maximum thickness. The ectocervix measures 40 x 32mm. The myometrium contains three fibroids ranging from 9-20mm in maximum diameter.  The left fallopian tube measures 52mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter. The left ovary measures 65 x 45 x 35mm. The surface of the left ovary is extensively covered by nodular/papillary excrescences. On slicing the left ovary there is a unilocular 40 x 25 x15mm cyst with smooth inner lining.  The remainder of the left ovary has a solid cut surface showing pale and yellowish areas. The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 72 x 55 x 25mm.  The surface of the right ovary is extensively covered by nodular/papillary excrescences similar to the other ovary. There is a 6 x 6 x 5mm nodular deposit on the serosal surface of the right fallopian tube. On sectioning there is a 48 x 45 x 10mm unilocular cyst with smooth lining within the right ovary. The cyst is filled with clear fluid. The remainder of the ovary has a pale/yellow solid cut surface.     
Blocks 1-3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 - anterior body of uterus, the roughened serosal surface and myometrial fibroids; 5-7 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 8 & 9 - representative from nodular deposits on posterior uterine serosal surface; 10 - representative left fallopian tube; 11-17 - representative left ovary; 17 - reserve block; 18 - representative right fallopian tube; 19-25 - representative right ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of  a piece of omental tissue 270 x 70 x 10mm.  There is extensive nodular deposits occupying approximately 1/3 of the specimen.  Blocks 1 & 2 - representative sections. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Right side wall nodule", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue 50 x 30 x 10mm in aggregate. There is a tan nodular area on the surfaceof the larger piece 15mm in maximum dimension.  
Block 1- nodule bisected; 2 & 3- remainder of the tissue. AE. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas nodule", consists of 48 x 27 x 25mm nodular pieceof tissue. The cut surface is heterogenous showing pale yellow and tan areas.  Blocks 1 & 2 - representative sections.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right abdominal wall nodule", consists of a nodular piece of solid tissue with attached patchy fatty tissue 50 x 30 x 22mm.  The cut surface shows pale and yellow areas.Blocks 1 & 2 - representative sections.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr S Krolczyk) 
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of both ovaries.  Carcinoma also involves the serosa of both tubes, and the uterine serosa and outer myometrium.  In addition, there is a small focus of serous carcinoma in situ involving superficial endometrial glands (block 3) (this is favoured as a synchronous primary).
The myometrium shows leiomyomas and adenomyosis.  The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.
B, C, D & E.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, tubal serosa, uterine serosa, outer myometrium, omentum, right pelvic and abdominal side wall, and Pouch of Douglas.
A small focus of synchronous serous carcinoma in situ is noted in the endometrium.
