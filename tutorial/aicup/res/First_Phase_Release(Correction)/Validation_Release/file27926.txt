Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
Ovarian cancer on omentum biopsy.  No adjuvant chemo.  Ca 125 elevated.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, received fresh for frozen section, consists of 220 x 60 x 20mm unorientated fatty tissue.  Diffuse firm areas are present, up to 75 x 55 x 14mm.  Two sections for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - frozen section; 3 to 5 - three sections of largest nodule; 6 &amp;amp; 7 -  RS other nodule.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Large cell malignancy, favour high grade serous carcinoma.
Result to Dr Freddie by Dr U Munda/Dr U Delsavio on 5/8/18 at 3:48pm.   (TO:SW/ta 6/10/66)

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 65g in total.  The uterus measures 67 x 42 x 23mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix is 22 x 18mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The anterior paracervical soft tissue is inked blue and the posterior is inked black.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 3mm thick and the myometrium is up to 12mm thick and has a 5mm diameter, pale firm nodule in the anterior uterine wall and a similar 9mm diameter nodule in a subserosal location in the posterior wall.  The right fallopian tube is 48 x 6mm in diameter with the fimbrial end having a 10 x 8 x 6mm pale nodule attached to the surface.  In the mid mesosalpinx is a collection of similar smaller firm nodules 3 to 5mm.  The right ovary is 23 x 10 x 6mm with a normal external surface.  The left fallopian tube is 52 x 7mm in diameter and similarly has a 12 x 9 x 6mm firm nodule at the fimbrial end with possible 2 to 3mm small nodules in the mid mesosalpinx.  The left ovary is 23 x 9 x 6mm with a normal external surface.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full  LS posterior body and cervix; 7 - posterior subserosal myometrial lesion; 8 - right fallopian tube fimbrial end; 9 &amp;amp; 10 - four TS right fallopian tube; 11 &amp;amp; 12 - right ovary bisected; 13 - left fallopian tube fimbrial end; 14 &amp;amp; 15 - four TS left fallopian tube; 16 &amp;amp; 17 - left ovary bisected.  All of the ovaries embedded.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Anterior abdominal wall&amp;quot;, consists of 30 x 20 x 8mm unorientated fibrofatty tissue.  The external surface is inked blue.  Serial slices show a 11 x 8 x 6mm firm nodule at one end with a pale to brown cut surface.
Blocks: 1 - nodule in three sections; 2 - two TS uninvolved area.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Appendix&amp;quot;, consists of a 66mm long convoluted appendix with a diameter up to 12mm in the distal half.  There is included cuff of caecum 52 x 30 x 16mm with a staple line at the resection margin 60mm long which is inked blue and removed.  The attached mesoappendix and mesocolon is up to 25mm in thickness.  On the serosal surface of the caecal cuff is a 6 x 5 x 4mm grey brown firm nodule.  In the periappendiceal fat there is a 16 x 13 x 12mm firm nodule attached to the external wall of the appendix and this nodule appears to extend and encircle around the entire appendix, distal to which point the appendix diameter is increased.  A separate 8 x 6 x 6mm pale firm nodule is noted in the mesocolic fat.
Blocks: 1  - appendix tip bisected; 2 to 5 - two TS of appendix with encircling nodule, (each bisected with appendix in blocks 2 and 4); 6 - TS of appendix proximal to encircling lesion; 7 &amp;amp; 8 - appendix base and caecum bisected longitudinally, including caecal margin; 9 - mesocolic nodule bisected; 10 &amp;amp; 11 - caecal serosal nodule bisected (including caecal margin); 12 - two ?lymph nodes.    (TO:SW/ta 6/10/66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Vaclavik):
A.  Sections show extensive high grade serous carcinoma.

B.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma involving the endocervical and uterine serosa, surface of both ovaries, paradnexal soft tissues, and both fimbrial ends of the tubes.  In addition, both fimbriae show carcinoma in situ.
The ectocervical and endocervical epithelium is unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium contains small leiomyomas.

C.  Sections show several deposits of high grade serous carcinoma.

D.  Sections show numerous deposits of high grade serous carcinoma involving the serosa and muscularis propria of the appendix and the serosa of the caecum, including at the surgical margin.  One negative lymph node is present.


DIAGNOSIS:
High grade serous carcinoma of peritoneal / tubal origin involving the omentum, uterine serosa, surface of both ovaries, fimbrial ends of both tubes, paradnexal soft tissue, anterior abdominal wall, appendix and caecum.
