Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Omental biopsy.  Is there cancer.   ? BRCA 2.  Possible high grade carcinoma on curettings.  BRCA2 mutation.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Omental nodule" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 15 x 10mm with a suture adjacent to an area of surface grey discolouration 7 x 5mm.  Specimen is bisected and no definite nodule is identified.   All grey area embedded, half in formalin.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 & 3 - fibrofatty tissue.  AE.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour endometriosis. 
Result to Dr Shiverdecker by Dr G Tidball and Dr G Learman at 15.05 on 27/8/13.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus + cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 66g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 50 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 26mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 14mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopiantube measures 50mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 23 x 18 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length x 7 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 30 x 13 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. 
Blocks: 1 to 4 - two full LS section of anterior body and cervix;5 to 10 - three full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 - right parametrium; 12 to 14 - fallopian tube AE; 15 & 16 - right ovary AE; 17 - left parametrium tissue; 18 to 20 - left fallopian tube; 21 & 22 - left ovary; 23 to 38 - all endometrium and cervix embedded.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 8 x 5 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.
   
D.  Specimen labelled "Left paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 18 x 10 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
 
E.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic side wall" consists of a piece of grey/tan tissue measuring 18 x 12 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
 
F.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall" consists of a piece of grey/tan tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 8mm.   AE 1 block.
    
G.  Specimen labelled "Pouch of Douglas peritoneum" consists of a piece of grey/tan tissue measuring 15 x 8 x 6mm.   AE 1 block.
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Anterior bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of grey/tan tissue measuring 15 x 13 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
I.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 180 x 55 x 15mm.  There are white fibrotic areas within the specimen, however no discretelesion is identified.  Representative 3 blocks.  (White area AE in block 1).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Maas): 
A, C, D, E, F, G, H & I.  Sections show scattered adhesions.  The frozen section shows endometriosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  THE ENDOMETRIUM, ECTOCERVIX, ENDOCERVIX, BOTH OVARIESAND BOTH TUBES HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY.  Sections show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.
COMMENT:
Given the negative results above, I now favour the previous endometrial biopsy (28L06475) as a contaminant.
This result was discussed with Dr G. Thode on 2/10/63.
