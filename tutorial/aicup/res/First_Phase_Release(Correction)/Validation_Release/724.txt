CLINICAL:
Omental mass.  Previous pleural effusion demonstrated ?Mullerian origin.  Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy single agent.  Laparotomy today, unable to resect all of tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube, right ovary" consists of a piece of tissue 50 x 45 x 28mm.  One side of the specimen is fairly smooth while the other side is ragged.  The cut surface reveals a nodular cream mass with several cystic areas.  A possible tube is identified encased within the mass.  Representative sections in 7 blocks.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of an irregular piece of cream, fatty and haemorrhagic tissue 120 x 50 x 40mm.  The omentum is largely replaced by cream coloured, firm, nodular, poorly circumscribed tumour.  Representative sections in 5 blocks (block 5 reserved block).  (TO: YX; PR/vo 30.7.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Shanaa):
A.  Sections show ovary and fallopian tube and associated soft tissues. There is a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma which involves the ovary, the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube and part of the associated soft tissue.  The fallopian tube is otherwise unremarkable and no carcinoma in situ of tubal epithelium is identified.  The tumour shows minimal evidence of treatment effect.  
B.  Sections of omentum show extensive replacement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is minimal evidence of chemotherapyeffect.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Right ovary and tube:  Moderately differentiatedserous carcinoma involving ovary, fimbrial end of tube and para-ovarian soft tissues.
B.   Omentum:  Serous carcinoma.
