CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma on curettings.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries and cervix" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 76g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 30mm, has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and appears unremarkable.  Over the anterior and posterior uterine body there is a polypoid roughened area which measures 35 x 28mm anteriorly which appears to invade to a maximum depth of 10mm over a total wall thickness, 18mm.  There is similar slightly roughened area, 35 x 30mm in the posterior uterine body and appears to invade to a maximum depth of 7mm over a total wall thickness, 16mm.  The remainder of the myometrium appears unremarkable.  The right fallopiantube measures 50mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 8mm and the cut surface appears unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 135mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 6mm.The left ovary is 22 x 10 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 & 8 - further representative anterior uterus; 8 & 9 - further representative posterior uterus; 10 - right tube; 11 - right ovary; 12 - left tube; 13 - left ovary; 14 - reserved block.  
(TO: FY; WR/mm 3.12.63) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr O Strecker) 
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  Anteriorly the tumour invades 5mm through a wall 11mm thick and posteriorly the tumour invades 8mm through a wall 18mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.
The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.  Both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 5mm through a wall 11mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
