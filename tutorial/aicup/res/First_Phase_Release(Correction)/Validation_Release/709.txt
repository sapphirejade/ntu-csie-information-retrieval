CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass, raised CA125. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of an enlarged ovarian mass 160 x 150 x 85mm with attached unremarkable fallopian tube 55 x 8mm.  The tumour appears solid, cystic and there are two rupture areas 10mm and 30mm in length.  The external surface appears smooth.  The solid component shows extensive necrosis.  Two sections are taken for FS.  Blocks 1 & 2- FS; 3-18 - 16 representative sections of the tumour (block 18 selected for tissue bank); 19 - 2LS fimbria; 20 - representative sections of the fallopian tube. 
FROZEN SECTION:  Difficult - invasive adenocarcinoma, favour mucinous (some endometrioid features). 
Result to Prof Zsohar via anaesthetist by A/Prof D Mosimann/ Dr D Scherman at 4:30pm on 26.9.12.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix and left tube and ovary", consists of a uterus with attachedcervix and left fallopian tube and ovary, weighing in total 156g.  The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Themajority of endometrium is thickened measuring up to 6mm in thickness and it has a fleshy and friable appearance.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 30mm.  On sectioning there is one intramural fibroid 20 x 15 x 15mm and one endocervical cyst 7 x 7mm.  The left tube is 50mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The fimbria is present and has one paratubal cyst 10 x 5 x 5mm.  The left ovary is 30 x 20 x 15mm and has a cystic appearance.  On sectioning there is a unilocular cyst 10 x 15mm and is filled with serous fluid.  Apart from this a yellow corpus 10 x 10mm is identified.  
Blocks 1-5 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 6 & 7 - two representative of anterior endomyometrium; 8-12 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 13 - one representative section of posterior endomyometrium; 14 - one representative section of posterior endomyometrium; 15 - one section from the fibroid; 16 - one representative section of the left cornua; 17 - right parametrial tissue; 18 - left parametrial tissue; 19 - 2LS left fimbria and paratubal cyst and 1TS left fallopian tube; 20 & 21 - representative sections from the left ovary. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Capsular of sigmoid mesentery", consists of several pieces of white firm tissue and blood clot measuring in aggregate 15 x 5 x 5mm.  Block 1 - soft white tissue; 2 - blood clot.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy", consists of a piece of omentum 130 x 50 x 10mm.  Onsectioning it is unremarkable.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Appendix", consists of an appendix 45 x 5 x 5mm.  The external surface is unremarkable. On sectioning the lumen is narrow and unremarkable.  AE.  Block 1 - 2LS proximal appendix; 2 - 4TS mid appendix; 3 - 2LS distal appendix.
F.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid FOT", consists of a nodular piece of fat 15 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.   
G.  Specimen labelled "Rectal biopsy", consists of one piece of fatty tissue 7 x 5 x 2mm. AE 1 block.   (KI/ec 26.11.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Weyrauch):
A.  Sections of right ovary show a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1) with usual glandular architecture.  The carcinoma shows architectural grade 1 and no solid component is seen.The tumour cells show nuclear grade 1 to 2.  The carcinoma is confined to the ovary.  Most of the ovary is involved by the tumour and large areas of necrosis are present.  There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (block A5)	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B.  Sections of uterus show a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1).  The carcinoma shows usual glandular architecture, which is similar to that of previous tumour described in the specimen A.  The carcinoma shows architectural grade 1 and no solid component is seen.  The tumour cells show nuclear grade 1 to 2.  The carcinoma invades less than one half of the myometrial invasion andthe maximal depth of myometrial invasion is 1mm (block B6).  The myometrial thickness is 25mm.  The tumour is within the uterine corpus and is completely excised.  The endocervix and cervix are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  The rest of endometrium shows no significant abnormality.  The myometrium shows a benign leiomyoma and foci of adenomyosis.  The uterine serosa is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The left ovary is unremarkable except several follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts.
C.  Sections show fragments of blood clot, fibrous tissue and fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
D.  Sections show mature adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There isno evidence of malignancy.
E.  Sections of appendix show no significant abnormality.  No inflammation is seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show one piece of fatty tissue with focal areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis and acute inflammation.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
G.  Sections show one piece of fatty tissue with focal areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis and acute inflammation.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Representative slides are shown to Dr D Pappajohn.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right tube and ovary - Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1).
B.  Uterus, cervix and left tube and ovary - Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 1).
C.  Capsule of sigmoid mesentery - No evidence of malignancy.
D.  Omental biopsy - No significant abnormality.
E.  Appendix - No significant abnormality.
F.  Sigmoid FOT - No evidence of malignancy.
G.  Rectal biopsy - No evidence of malignancy.
