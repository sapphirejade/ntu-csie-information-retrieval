F section Lext. iliac lymph nodes x 2.  Left obturator lymph nodes.  Cervical SCC.  Cervical cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 30mm, with a lymphnode 15 x 10 x 8mm.  
Blocks: 1 - node for frozen section; 2 - remainder of node.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of apiece of fatty tissue, 50 x 10 x 10mm, with a lymph node, 15 x 7 x 5mm.  
Blocks: 1 - node for frozen section; 2 - remainder of node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 50 x 20 x 10mm, with a fatty lymph node. 
Blocks: 1 - node for frozensection; 2 - remainder of node.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node S section" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 43 x 23 x 14mm, with a lymph node. 
Blocks: 1 - node for frozen section; 2 - remainder of node.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node F section" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 45 x 35 x 3mm, with a lymph node, 22 x 11 x 3mm.  A second lymph node 3mm across is identified. 
Blocks: 1 - larger lymph node for frozen section; 2 - remainder of larger lymph node; 3 - smallest lymph node.
F.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix" consists of a uterus with cervix, 85 x 55 x 35mm, weighing 87g.  The fallopian tubes and ovaries are not present.  The ectocervix is 35mm in diameter.  There is attached vaginal cuff, 55mm in diameter.  There is attached parametrium/paracervical adipose tissue up to 15mm in width on the right and 20mm in width on the left.  The anterior margin is inked blue and the posterior margin black.  Centred at the transformation zone of the cervix is an ulcerating tumour, 25 x 10 x 15mm, which appears to infiltrate into the left parametrium.  The tumour is 3mm clear of the closest cervical margin (anterior).  The endometrium appears atrophic.  The myometrium is 18mm in thickness.  No focal myometrial lesions are seen.  
Blocks: 1 to 13 - anterior cervix serially embedded from left to right; 14 to 18 - upper end of anterior cervix serially embedded from left to right; 19 & 20 - anterior sagittal sections of uterus; 21 to 38 - posterior cervix and parametrial fat serially embedded from left towards right; 39 to 42 - upper end of posterior cervix serially embedded from left to right; 43 to 45 - posterior uterus sagittal section from isthmus to fundus.

G.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue, 45 x 40 x 20mm and 30 x 15 x 5mm.  Two possible lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 15mm across.  
Blocks: 1 - largest lymph node bisected; 2 - smaller lymph node. 
  
H.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue, 90 x 60 x 20mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest being 20mm across. 
Blocks: 1 - one lymph node bisected; 2 - two lymph nodes. 
I.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consistsof multiple fragments of fatty tissue, 40 x 30 x 10mm in aggregate.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, up to 10mm across. 
Blocks: 1 - multiple lymph nodes.
J.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 35 x 35 x 10mm across.A possible 3mm lymph node is identified.  
Blocks: 1 - possible lymph node; 2 - fatty tissue.   (KT/ta 22/4/64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr E Renda)
A.  Paraffin embedded sections of the left external iliac lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
B.  Paraffin embedded sections of the left external iliac lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
C.  Paraffin embedded sections of the left obturator lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1).

D.  Paraffin embedded sections of the right obturator lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1).
E.  Paraffin embedded sections of the two right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/2).
F.  The cervix has been embedded in its entirety and shows a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour has a maximum depth of 6.0mm and extends up to 12mm in length along the endocervical canal. Carcinoma appears confined to the cervix, but focally (at the posterior left aspect), carcinoma is 0.56mm from paracervical adipose tissue (F23). The tumour is 8.0mm from the ectocervical margin (block F4) and is 4.0mm from the deep margin. No convincing lymphovascular space or perineural invasion is seen. No convincing glandular dysplasia is identified. 
The endometrium is mid secretory with patchy cystic change. There is focal adenomyosis and endosalpingiosis. There are occasional foci of polarisable suture material associated with a foreign body type giant cell reaction and secondary abscess formation. Scattered vessels show inflammatory change, most likely related to the adjacent abscess. 
G.  Sections of the two left external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/2).
H.  Sections of the three right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/3).
I.  Sections of the three right obturator lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/3).
J.  Sections of the four left obturatorlymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/4).
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left external iliac lymph node (frozen section): No evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

B.  Left external iliac lymph node (frozen section): No evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

C.  Left obturator lymph node (frozen section): No evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

D.  Right obturator lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/1). 

E.  Right external iliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/2). 

F.  Uterus and cervix:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, depth 6.0mm, length 12mm. Carcinoma is focally close to the paracervical soft tissue (0.56mm),but appears clear of the margins. 
Mid secretory endometrium, adenomyosis and endosalpingiosis. 

G.  Left external iliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/2).

H.  Right externaliliac lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/3).

I.  Right obturator lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/3).

J.  Left obturator lymph node: No evidence of malignancy (0/4).
