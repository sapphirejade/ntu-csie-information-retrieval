CLINICAL:
Pelvic mass.  Fibroids.  Right ureteric stent.  Smoker/THC.  Large right adnexal pelvic mass causing right ureteric obstruction.  Large external iliac mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary", consists of a solid ovarian mass measuring 110 x 80 x 70mm with an attached tube measuring 90mm in length x 10mm in maximum diameter.  Thesurface of the ovarian mass is mostly smooth with attached adherent fallopian tube and a small segment of omentum measuring 15 x 15 x 5mm.  Patchy areas of the serosa appear ragged and disrupted with areas of overlying haemorrhage.  On sectioning the ovarian mass is mostly solid with a variegated tan appearance and areas of necrosis.  
Blocks: 1 and 2 - frozen section de-blocked; 3 to 9 - ovarian mass; 10 and 11 - fallopian tube adherent to mass; 12 - Reserve tumour block. 
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma with possible squamous differentiation.

B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 158g.  The uterus measures 85 x 80 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 33mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometriumis 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 38mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids measuring 20 and 35mm in maximum diameter.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body andcervix; 5 to 8 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a piece of omentum measuring 300 x 140 x 10mm.  There are patchy areas of haemorrhage on the surface of the omentum.  However no discreet lymph nodes or masses are identified within the fibroadipose tissue.  Representativein 3 blocks. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary", consists of an ovarian mass measuring 40 x 30 x 28mm.  The mass has a partly adherent fallopian tube measuring 45mm in length x 7 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The outer surface of the ovary is smooth with patchy areas of haemorrhage.  On sectioning the cut surface is solid, and tan with a cental cystic area. 
Blocks: 1 to 4 - ovarian mass; 5 - fallopian tube adherent to ovary.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic peritoneum", consists of two pieces of haemorrhagic tan tissue measuring 15 and 20mmin maximum dimension.  Specimen AE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic side wall mass", consists of multiple pieces of tan disrupted haemorrhagic tissue measuring from 10 to 70mm in maximum dimension.  The cut surface of the largest mass consists of a fibrous and pale tan cut surface with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  Representative in 6 blocks.
G.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node", consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue.  The largest piece measures 75 x 25 x 30mm and has a large firm cream tumoural mass within and extending into the surrounding adipose tissue.  The other two fragments measure 20 and 20mm in maximum dimension. 
Blocks: 1 - 1TS from largest tumour and extension into adipose tissue; 2 and 3 - smaller fragments AE.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr. J Shanaa):
A & D.  Sections show a poorly differentiated carcinoma of both ovaries which is extensively necrotic.  Thetumour shows focal squamous differentiation and is focally positive for AE1/3, CAM5.2, EMA, SMA, is strongly positive for Vimentin, and is negative for CK7, CK20 and Desmin.  The tumour is best classified as a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Carcinoma also involves the fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube and the lymphatics of both tubes.
The tumour is negative for ER and PR.
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed.  MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining. This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
B.  Deposits of carcinoma are seen within the lymphatics of the cervix.  Otherwise the ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium is unremarkable.  The myometrium shows leiomyomas.  The uterine serosa shows foci of endometriosis.
C.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.
E & F.  Sections show poorly differentiated carcinoma.
G.  Four of four lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.  Extracapsular spread is present.
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of both ovaries also involving the fimbrial end of the right tube, the lymphatics of both tubes, the lymphatics of the cervix, right pelvic peritoneum, right pelvic side wall and four right external iliac lymph nodes.
