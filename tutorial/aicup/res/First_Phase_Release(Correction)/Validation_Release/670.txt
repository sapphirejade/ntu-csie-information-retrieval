CLINICAL:
Liver resection stage 1 post chemo. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Liver 4B, 5, 6, 8 region", consists of an irregular piece of liver, unorientated, measuring 120 x 70 x 30mm.  There is an area of serosal puckering with a white solid tumour measuring 7mm in maximum diameter. The surgical margin is inked blue.  On sectioning an between the surgical margin there is an ill defined white solid tumour measuring 25 x 20 x 30mm.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  Blocks 1-6 - representative sections of the tumour with surgicalmargin (6 - reserve block); 7 - liver away from the tumour.
B.  Specimen labelled "Liver segment 7", consists of a piece of liver, unoriented, measuring 25 x 25 x 15mm with an area of serosal puckering 15mm in maximum diameter. On sectioning there is a tumour with similar features as described in specimen A.  Thelesion measures 20 x 15 x 30mm and macroscopically is located 3mm from the surgical margin.  Representative sections of the lesion in 2 blocks. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder", consists of a gallbladder 70 x 30 x 30mm.  The external surface is green and shiny.  It is filled with bile.  No gallstones are identified. The mucosal surface is velvety. The wall has a maximum thickness of 1mm.  
Block 1- 1TS neck; 2- 1TS body; 3 -LS fundus.  (XW/ec   14.11.63) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr A Hohenstein) 
A.  Sections of liver show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumour cells with highgrade nuclei are arranged in cribriform glands and solid nests.  Focal areas of necrosis are present.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The tumour is incompletely excised and focally extendsto the resection margin (block A3 and A5).  The liver tissue away from the tumour shows no significant abnormality.
B.  Sections of liver show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumour shows same appearances as those described in the specimen A.  The tumour is completely excised and the section margin is clear.
C.  Sections of gallbladder show no significant abnormality.  The cystic duct lymph node is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Liver resections - Adenocarcinoma.
C.  Gallbladder - No significant abnormality.
