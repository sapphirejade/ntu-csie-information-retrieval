CLINICAL:
Frozen section left interior parathyroid. 
There is a discrepancy between the form which is labelled "inferior left parathyroid" and the specimen which is labelled "superior left parathyroid".
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left superior parathyroid", consists of a soft tan piece of tissue measuring 30 x 15 x 5mm and weighing 1763mg.  A soft tan nodule is located at one end measuring 12 x 10 x 5mm which merges with the rest of the tissue.  The nodular area is bisected and half embedded for frozen section. 
Blocks: 1 - frozen section AE; 2 and 3 - remainder of tissue AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Consistent with parathyroid tissue.
Phone result to Dr Numbers by Dr. K Treider and Dr K Krysiak on 17.07.13 at 3:47pm
(CS/vo 20.9.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Fecteau):
Sections show parathyroid tissue with increased cellularity and diminished fat content.  Small amount of normal appearing parathyroid tissue is seen at the periphery.  Inthe right clinical setting, the appearances are consistent with those of parathyroid adenoma (1763mg).  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left inferior parathyroid - Parathyroid adenoma (1763mg).
