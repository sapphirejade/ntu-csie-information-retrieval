Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Adnexal mass - raised CA 152 (300's).  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consistsof a cystic structure which has been opened prior to receipt and measures 55 x 65 x 10mm.  It weighs 24g.  The fallopian tube is not identified.  The internal surface of the cyst contains vegetations up to 8mm in heightand comprising approximately 40% of the surface.  Two blocks for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section; 2 - frozen section; 3 to 8 - representative sections from the tumour (block 8 -tissue selected for tissue bank).  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Serous papillary carcinoma.  
Phone result to Anaesthetist (Prof Retterbush's theatre) by Prof J Stai/Dr J Bynd at 145pm on 26.09.12. 
B.  Specimen labelled "?Right fallopian tube" consists of a tubular structure, 30 x 5 x 5mm.  The external surface is shiny and smooth.  No fimbria is identified.  Thelumen is narrow.  AE 1 block.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary"consists of a tube with ovary attached.  The fallopian tube measures 40 x 5 x 5mm.  The fimbria is identified.  The external surface is smooth and shiny.  The ovary measures 25 x 10 x 5mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning of the ovary there are papilliform areas and solid nodular areas measuring up to 7mm in maximum diameter.  The attached broad ligament has a nodular appearance.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - ovary all embedded; 4 - two LS fimbria; 5 - representative sections from the fallopian tube; 6 & 7 - representative sections from the broad ligament.  
D. Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of an omental cake, 300 x 70 x 20mm.  It appears to be coveredby multiple white nodules measuring up to 90mm.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (GX/mm 29.11.62) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr J Wickenhauser) 
A, B & C.  Both ovaries show predominantly high grade borderline serous tumours.  Small foci of well differentiated invasive serouscarcinoma are present in the borderline tumours.  In addition, there are foci of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma in the paradnexal soft tissues and the surface of the ovaries.
Both fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.
D.  Sections shown extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum and paradnexal soft tissues.
Both ovaries show high grade borderline serous tumours with small foci of well differentiated serous carcinoma.
