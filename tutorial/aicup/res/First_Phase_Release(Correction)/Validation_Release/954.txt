Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Lap left hemicolectomy.  Descending colon cancer.  Polyp.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left hemi-colon" consists of a segment of colon 115mm in length with attached mesenteric fatty tissue measuring 105 x 50 x 60mm.  There is a 43 x 40 x 12mm near circumferential solid tumour.  The tumour has a depressed centre and raised edges.  The cut surface of the tumour is pale and solid.  The tumour is 15mm from one resection margin and 47mm from the other resection margin.   The tumour appears to have penetrated into the muscularis propria.  
Blocks: 1 - resection margin closest to the tumour, LF; 2 - resection margin away from tumour, shavemargin; 3 to 7 - TS, tumour (block 4 - reserve block); 8 - one bisected lymph node; 9 - one bisected lymph node; 10 - lymph nodes as seen; 11 - one bisected lymph node; 12 - apical lymph node; 13 - one bisected lymph node; 14 - one bisected lymph node.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid polyp" consists of two pieces of solid tan tissue 15 x 7 x 3mm and 5 x 5 x 2mm.  The larger piece is bisected.  AE 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Filip): 
A. 

Site of tumour:  Descending colon	
Maximum tumour diameter:   43mm
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin: 15mm
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  13	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  2 (up to 2.3mm in size, no extranodal spread, apical node not involved)	
pN1b	Metastases in 2-3 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
Summary - TNM 7th Edition
pT3     pN1b     pMX     R0
B. Sections show a tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Left hemicolectomy:
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invading pericolic fat (pT3), margins clear
- Metastatic carcinoma in 2 out of 13 lymph nodes (pN1b)
B. Sigmoid colon polyp: tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia
