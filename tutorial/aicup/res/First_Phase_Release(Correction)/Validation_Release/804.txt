BRCA 1+.  L/O R WLE for IDC.  Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.   Short superior,long lateral suture.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast short superior, long lateral" consists of a total mastectomy with overlying skin, with nipple and areola complex and two sutures for orientation as above.  The specimen measures 160mm (medial to lateral) x 150mm (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  The skin fragment measures 70 x 35mm.  There is an old linear scar adjacent to the areola measuring 15mm in length.  The superficial margin is inked blue,the deep margin black.  On sectioning the parenchyma in the upperouter quadrant shows a stellate scar measuring 15 x 15 x 10mm.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.
Blocks: 1 - nipple and areola; 2 - representative section from the scar; 3 to 5 - upper outer quadrant; 6 to 8 - upper inner quadrant; 9 to 11 - lower outer quadrant; 12 to 14 - lower inner quadrant.  
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast short superior, medium medial, long lateral" consists of a total mastectomy with three sutures for orientation as above and an ellipse of skin with nipple and areola complex measuring 150mm (medial to lateral) x 140mm (superior to inferior) and 40mm (superficial to deep) margin.  The ellipse of skin measures 50 x 30mm and is unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.  On sectioning it has a fibrofatty appearance.
Blocks: 1 - one nipple and areola section; 2 to 4 - upper outer quadrant; 5 to 7 - upper inner quadrant; 8 to 10 - lower outer quadrant; 11 to 13 - lower inner quadrant.     (BQ/ta 16/3/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Derting): 
A & B.  Representative sections from both breasts show mild fibrocystic change.  There is no other significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy.
