CLINICAL:
Sigmoid colon cancer.  No mets.  LAR resection.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a donut of intestine 15mm in maximum diameter.  A stapled margin is removed and the rest of the tissue is embedded in 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of a segment of large intestine 200mm from proximal to distal and up to 30mm in maximum diameter.  The distal sigmoid colon measures 110mm in length and the rectum measures 100 mm in length.  The anterior peritoneal reflection is identified and is located 5mm from the distal margin.  On the external surface 40mm from the distal margin and in the anterior aspect of the rectum there is a area of serosal puckering 10mm in maximum diameter.  The posterior peritonealized margin is inked blue.  On sectioning and in the area of serosal puckering there is an almost circumferential tumour mainly measuring 50mm from proximal to distal and 45mm in maximum diameter.  It is located 25mm from the distal margin and 150mm from the proximal margin.  On sectioning the tumour has a maximum thickness of 6mm and appears to involve the serosal surface.  No perirectal fat invasion is seen macroscopically and the closest radial margin the right anterolateral margin and the tumour is approximately 22mm from this margin. The tumour is all embedded from proximal to distal in serial transverse sections as follows:
Blocks:  1 to 16 - tumour, 17 - LS of distal margin; 18 - TS proximal margin; 19 - apical node; 20 to 26- lymph nodes from the pericolic fat; 27 to 30 - Lymph nodesfrom the perirectal fat.  (TO: AD; FF/rt 28.4.64)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr B Driere):
A. Sections show large bowel with no evidence of malignancy.
B. Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon/upper rectum (involving 90% of the bowel circumference)	
Maximum tumour diameter:  50mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 25mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:     No
For rectal tumours
Relation of tumour to anterior peritoneal reflection:	 Above
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  8mm (posterior B10)
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  42	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Other comments:
Diverticular disease is seen in the sigmoid colon. 
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
