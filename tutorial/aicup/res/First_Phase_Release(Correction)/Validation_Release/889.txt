CLINICAL:
SCC cervix.  Discharge planning.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, cervix, ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, vaginal cuff, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 162g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 50 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 65 x 55mm and has a circumferential fungating tan tumour which measures 45 x 40mm anteriorly and 60 x 45mm posteriorly.  The vaginal cuff measures 70 x 45mm anteriorly and 75 x 25 x 25mm posteriorly.  The anterior cervical neck margin is inked blue while the posterior is inked black.  Thecut surface of the tumour shows invasion deeply into cervix with the tumour coming to 1mm from the anterior cervical neck margin and 1mm from the posterior uterine serosa.  Macroscopically the myometrium is 15mm in maximal thickness while the endometrium is <1mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length, 6mm in external diameter.  The right ovary measures 19 x 11 x 9mm and appears grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length, 6mm in external diameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 15 x 14mm.  Its external surface is uniformly smooth while its cut surface shows a 12mm cyst containing thick haemorrhagic material.  Representative sections in 64 blocks.  Please see attached diagram.
Blocks:  1 to 5 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 6 to 14 - right anterior cervix further representative sections; 15 to 26 - left anterior cervix further representative sections; 27 to 32 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 33 to 42 - left posterior cervix further representative sections; 43 to 56 - right posterior cervix further representative sections; 57 & 58 - right paracervical tissue all embedded; 59 - left paracervical tissue all embedded; 60 - right fallopian tube representative section; 61 - right ovary bisected all embedded; 62 - left fallopian tube representative sections; 63 & 64 - left ovary all embedded. 
B.Specimen labelled "Right vaginal angle" consists of an irregular piece of mucosa with underlying soft tissue measuring 13 x 10mm to a depth of 8mm.  The mucosal surface appears grossly normal.  TAE 3 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 15mm and 40 x 25 x 10mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 20mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 2 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 - one lymph node; 2- four lymph nodes.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue measuring 65 x 40 x 15mm containing two lymph nodes measuring 4 and 45mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 8 blocks.  
Blocks:  1- one lymph node; 2 to 8 - larger lymph node divided into seven.
E.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator node" consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue measuring 35 x 20 x 8mm and 35 x 30 x 12mm containing lymph nodes measuring from 2 to 23mm across.  Lymph nodes AE 3 blocks.
Blocks:  1 - two lymph nodes; 2 - three lymph nodes; 3 - one lymph node bisected.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr G Minott): 
A.  Sections of the cervix show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  It invades deeply into cervical stroma.  Maximum depth of invasion is 21mm out of a total cervical stromal thickness of 22mm.  It is 0.5mm from the nearest anterior cervical deep stromal margin and 1mm from the nearest posterior deep stromal margin.  The vaginal cuff margin is free of tumour; the closest vaginal cuff margin is 4mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the cervical stroma.  No perineural invasion is seen.  There is extensive CIN 3 overlying the invasive tumour but the vaginal cuff margin is free of dysplasia.  Tumour extends into the upper endocervix.  The endocervical columnar epithelium is unremarkable.  There is no involvement of paracervical soft tissues.  One paracervical lymph node which was identified is free of tumour.  
Sections of the endometrium show that this is in proliferative phase.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  There is a cystic corpus luteum in the left ovary.  The right ovary is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show stratified squamous epithelium with underlying tissue.  There is no dysplasia or evidence of malignancy.  
C.  Sections show five lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
D.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.
E.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  No tumouris seen.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of cervix.
B.  Right vaginal angle:  No abnormality seen.
C.  Right external iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/5).
D.  Right obturator lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2).
E.  Left obturator nodes:  No tumour (0/6).
