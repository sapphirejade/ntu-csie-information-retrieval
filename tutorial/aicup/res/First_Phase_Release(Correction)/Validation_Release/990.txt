CLINICAL:
Right occipital tumour ?GBM.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "?GBM" consists of two pieces of cream tissue measuring 5 and 12mm.  Smear done from each piece.  Half of each taken for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section one; 2- frozen section two; 3- remainder tissue.  AE 3 blocks.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:  
Metastatic large cell malignancy favour carcinoma.  
Phone result to Dr D Hagler (JMO) by Dr D Cantrall at 14.40 on 12/.03.14.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right occipital tumour" consists of multiple fragments of necrotic tumour tissue measuring in aggregate 55 x 40 x 30mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.  -/3 blocks.  (OZ/mm 15.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Tela):
A & B.  The sections of brain show sheets of highly atypical epithelial cells associated with abundant necrosis.  Islands of viable tumour cells are present in a perivascular location.  The tumour cells are arranged in solid sheets and there are so areas of pseudoglandular and papillary-like patterns.  There is marked nuclear pleomorphism and abundant mitoses, many of which are atypical.  
No intracytoplasmic pigment is identified and no squamous differentiation is seen.  
The tumour cells show strong positive staining for CAM 5.2 but are negative for GFAP, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.  There is also positive staining for Keratin 7 and Oestrogen receptor.  Progesterone receptor is negative and the Oestrogen receptor staining is weak and focal.  TTF-1, CEA, Keratin 20 and P63 are all negative.  The P63 stain shows positive nuclear staining in a minority of cells within the tumour.  
The histological appearances are consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The presence of Oestrogen receptor staining raises the possibility of origin from breast or female genital tract amongst other sites.  Staining for CA125 and WT1 have been performed and are negative.  The CA125 shows very focal staining of uncertain significance.
The adjacent cerebral tissue shows changes suggestive of Congophilic angiopathy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Right occipital tumour:  
- Metastatic carcinoma.  
- CHANGES SUGGESTIVE OF CONGOPHILIC ANGIOPATHY.
