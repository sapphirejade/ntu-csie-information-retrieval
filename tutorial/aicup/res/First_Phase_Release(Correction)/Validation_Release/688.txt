Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Likely peritoneal cancer.  Interval debulking.  Depression/anxiety.  GORD.  Ascites.  
Additional information obtained:  Three cycles of chemotherapy performed pre-surgery.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus cervix tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing in total 60g.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 30mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube and fimbria measures 60mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 20 x 7 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube and fimbria measures 55mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 10 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. 
Blocks: 1 to 3 - one full LS anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - one full LS posterior body and cervix; 7 - right fimbria andfallopian tube; 8 - right ovary AE; 9 - left ovary AE; 10 - left fimbria and left fallopian tube.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Nodule right tube" consists of a nodular solid and yellow piece of tissue measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm.   AE 1 block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 320 x 150 x 15mm.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  Blocks: 4 - 13 - representative sections of the omentum.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Lenzen):
A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  A single leiomyoma is identified within the myometrium.  Foci of psammomatous calcification are seen on the serosal surface of the uterus, right and left fallopian tubes and ovary. The ovaries and fallopian tubes otherwise show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B.  Sections show a rounded nodule of foamy histiocytes with a central region of necrosis.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are present throughout the nodule. There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  The omentum is extensively sampled revealing a single very small deposit of adenocarcinoma embedded within omental fat.  The tumour cells have pleomorphic nuclei with eosinophilic macronucleoli suggestive of serous adenocarcinoma.  Small collections of foamy histiocytes and occasional foci of psammomatous calcification are also seen.  
COMMENT:
The presence of foamy histiocytes and residual psammomatous calcification are consistent with therapy effect.  The distribution of the psammomatous calcification together with the very small focus of adenocarcinoma within omentum are suggestive of a primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma.  


DIAGNOSIS:
A - C.  Uterus and cervix, tubes and ovaries, omentum:
-  Very small focus of residualserous adenocarcinoma within the omentum.  
-  Possible peritoneal origin (see comment)
-  Residual psammomatous calcification and therapy effect.
