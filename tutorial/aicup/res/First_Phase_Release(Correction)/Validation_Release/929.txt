CLINICAL:
X 2 sigmoid colon cancer.  Low anteriorresection.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon" consists of a segment of sigmoid measuring 130mm (proximal to distal) and 30mm in maximum diameter.  Proximal margin inked blue, distal margin black.  External surface has an area of retraction, 30mm from the proximal margin.  On sectioning there are two exophytic and ulcerated tumours.  Tumour no 1 measures 30mm (proximal to distal) and 25mm in maximum diameter.  It has antimesenteric location and it is 20mm from the proximal margin, 90mm from the distal margin and 20mm from tumour no 2.  On sectioning  it has a maximum thickness of 6mm and appears to be confined into the sigmoid wall.
Tumour no 2 measures 45mm (proximal to distal), 30mmin maximum diameter.  It is located in the left aspect of the sigmoid extending posteriorly.  It is 65mm from proximal margin and 40mm from distal margin.  On sectioning tumour it  has a maximum thickness of 7mm and appears to involve the wall of the sigmoid into the mesenteric fat.  The tumour is located 65mm from the radial margin.  Close to the tumour there is a positive lymph node, it is located 25mm from the radial margin.
No other lesions are identified.  
Blocks:  1 -proximal margin; 2- distal margin; 3 - two LS tumour no 1; 4 - one TS tumour no 1; 5 - TS tumour no 1; 6 - TS normal mucosa between tumours; 7 to 12 - representative sections of tumour no 2 (block 11 reserved block); 13 -apical node; 14 to 25 - multiple lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donuts" consists of two donuts of intestine, 20 x 20 x 5mm and 15 x 10 x 5mm.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - one donut each.  (TO: KL: NX/mm 16.3.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Arentz):
A. 

TUMOUR 1 (PROXIMAL)
Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon	
Maximum tumour diameter: 30mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  20mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:    No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria
TUMOUR 2 (DISTAL)
Site of tumour: Sigmoid colon	
Maximum tumour diameter:  45mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 40mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:     No

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria (tumour extends to outer edge of 		muscularis propria without intervening smooth muscle between 	tumour 	and mesenteric tissue, A9 L3)
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  41	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  5 (apical node not involved)	
pN2	Metastases in 4 or more regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
The distal tumour is associated with a tubular adenoma.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status (both tumours)	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
Summary - TNM 7th Edition
pT3(distal tumour)    pN2     pMX     R0
B. Sections show large bowel with no evidence of malignancy.	


DIAGNOSIS:
A. Sigmoid colon:
- Proximal tumour: 30mm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading muscularis propria (pT2), margins clear
- Distal tumour: 45mm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading pericolic fat (pT3), margins clear
- Metastatic carcinoma in 5 out of 41 lymph nodes (pN2)
B. Distal donuts:no evidence of malignancy
