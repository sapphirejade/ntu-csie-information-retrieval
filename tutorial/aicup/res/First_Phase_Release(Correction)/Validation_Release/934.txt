Distribution:  DR AARON,  FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Serous adenocarcinoma in pleural fluid.  Has had 2 cycles chemotherapy.  Interval debulking performed.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix uterus tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 88g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 48 x 33mm.  Anteriorly the serosal surface is roughened over an area of 25 x 12mm.  The non peritonealised surface of uterus is inked green anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The ectocervix measures 38 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 19mm in maximum thickness.  Theleft ovary measures 33 x 25 x 17mm.  There is a nodular mass on the surface of the left ovary 18 x 10 x 10mm.  The left fallopian tube measures 48mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 32 x 20 xmm.  There is a 15 x 12 x 12mm nodular growth on the surface of the ovary.  The right fallopian tube is 55mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter.  There is a thin walled 30 x 25 x 15mm cyst towards the distal end of the fallopian tube.  The cyst has a smooth inner lining and is filled with clear fluid.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - paired sections posterior cervix and uterus; 3 & 4 - paired sections anterior cervix and uterus; 5 - anterior body of uterus; 6 - anterior body of uterus; 4 & 6 - roughened serosal surface; 7 to 9 - all of the left ovary; 10 & 11 - all of the left fallopian tube; 12 to 14 - all ofthe right ovary; 15 to 17 - all of the right fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omental tissue 120 x 70 x 35mm in aggregate.  Slicing reveals several indurated nodules with mucoid/yellow cut surfaces.
Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative sections; 3 - representative section, reserve block.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Varaza):
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous papillary adenocarcinoma involving the surfaces of bothovaries.  A small focus of serous adenocarcinoma in-situ is present involving the luminal epithelium of right fallopian tube (block A16 and A17).  The left fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The uterus shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium and myometrium are unremarkable.  The serosa is unremarkable.  The cervix is unremarkable.
B.  Sections of omentum show extensive involvement by moderately differentiated serous adenocarcinoma.  Fibrous and numerous psammomatous calcification are present.
Representative slides are shown to Dr W Chafe.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries - Serous papillary adenocarcinoma involving surfaces of both ovaries.
B.  Omentum - Serous adenocarcinoma.
