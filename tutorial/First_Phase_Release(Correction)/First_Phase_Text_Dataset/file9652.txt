HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Ovarian cancer + peritoneal mets

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;OMENTUM, SPLEEN, APPENDIX, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIP + PELVIS STRIP, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;.  Omentum, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum and one piece of fibrotic tissue ?diaphragm.

The spleen weighs 126.4g and measures 110x55x30mm.  There is attached fat at the hilum measuring up to 25mm wide.  The capsule appears unremarkable.  On sectioning, within the fatty tissue at the hilum, is a deposit of tumour with a pale white cut surface.  The tumour appears to focally infiltrate into the splenic parenchyma.

(1-4 spleen in relation to tumour [2 tumour block, 3 focal infiltration into parenchyma];

The gallbladder measures 70mm in length with a  maximum diameter of 25mm.  The serosa is smooth and unremarkable.  The wall is up to 4mm thick.  No stones are found within the lumen.  The mucosa is granular green in appearance with strips of cholesterolosis.

5 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 6 body and fundus;

Omentum measuring 523x150x10mm.  It is caked by tumour with a pale white cut surface.   The tumour covers approximately 300mm of the omental tissue.

7&amp;amp;8 RS of omentum;

A fibrotic piece of tissue ?diaphragmatic strip measures 90mm in length by 25mm by 15mm.  On sectioning, the cut surface is fibrotic.  No lesional tissue is noted macroscopically.

9&amp;amp;10 RS of ?diaphragmatic strip;

Appendix measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 8mm.  There is attached mesoappendix up to 20mm wide.  The serosa is smooth and unremarkable.  The base was stapled shut.  The stapled edge was trimmed off with approximately 3mm of tissue, base then inked green.  The wall is up to 3mm thick.

11 LS through base and the tip; 12 TS mid appendix;

Separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue, some consistent with peritoneum.  Altogether they measure 270x190x30mm.  They are covered extensively by pale papillary-like deposits of tumour.

13&amp;amp;14 tumour involvement of peritoneum).  RS (M-14/MC/nh).

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr C Rossow)
Histology shows bulky deposits of metastatic carcinoma which has morphology consistent with clear cell carcinoma of primary ovarian origin. The tumour grows in a tubulo-papillary architecture with clear cytoplasm in places, hobnailed cytoplasm and high-grade nuclei. Eosinophilic hyaline cores are seen in some of the papillae. Deposits of carcinoma are seen throughout the omentum and over the capsule of the spleen, serosa of gallbladder, serosa of appendix and in other strips of peritonealised tissue.  Focally small foci of endometriosis are also seen in some fibrous tissue adjacent to tumour deposits (? pelvic peritoneum). The cystic duct lymph node is not involved.

DIAGNOSIS:
OMENTUM, SPLEEN, APPENDIX, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT DIAPHRAGM STRIPS, PELVIC STRIPS, PERITONEAL DISEASE -
-EXTENSIVE DEPOSITS OF METASTATIC CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA OF OVARIAN ORIGIN.
