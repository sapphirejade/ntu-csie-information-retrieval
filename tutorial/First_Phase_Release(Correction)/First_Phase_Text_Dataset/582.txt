CLINICAL:
42yr old female cervical cancer.  Known endocervical cancer.  Assess endometrium, ? endometrial primary.  Previous cone of cervix showed adenocarcinoma and extensiveACIS.  Laparotomy for cervical cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes + ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries weighing 115g in total.  The uterus measures 95 x 55 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The posterior cervical neck margin is inked blue while the anterior is inked black.  The specimen was opened for frozen section and no obvious tumour is seen macroscopically.  One section was taken from midline anterior lower body/uterus for frozen section.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximal thickness while the myometrium is 20mm in maximal thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length, 5mmin external diameter.  The right ovary measures 45 x 21 x 10mm and has a smooth external surface.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  The left fallopian tube is not identified.  The left ovary measures 35 x 35 x 20mm and has a smooth and shiny surface.  Its cut surface shows no obvious macroscopic abnormality.  Representative sectionsin 65 blocks.  Please see attached diagram.  
Blocks: 1 - frozen section lower anterior body; 2 to 17 - cervix anterior lip AE from right to left; 18 - anterior body superior and in continuity to frozen section block; 19 & 20 - longitudinal section anterior body; 21 to 35 - cervix posteriorly AE from left to right; 36  & 37, 38 & 39 - full longitudinal section posterior body in each; 40 to 43 - right fallopian tube AE; 44 to 49 - right ovary AE; 50 to 59 - left ovary AE; 60 to 65 - left adnexal soft tissue AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
There is no evidence of malignancy. 
Results to Mahdi (registrar for Dr Leedom) by Dr E Stepler at 17.15 on 19/11/12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Pannus" consists of several pieces of skin with underlying fatty tissue measuring from 55 x 20mm and a depth of 50mm to 495 x 170mm and a depth of 70mm and weighing 4.4kg in total.  On the skin surface of the largest piece there is a 2mm skin tag.  The cut surfaces of all the pieces show predominately fatty tissue.   No obvious focal mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right low common iliac lymph node" consists of a 30mm fatty lymph node with a small amount of attached fat measuring 40 x 10 x 3mm.  
AE 3 blocks.
Blocks: 1 & 2 - lymph node bisected; 3 - attached fatty tissue.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Pucella): 
A.  The whole cervix has been blocked.  Sections show scaring from a recent cone biopsy.  There is focal residual adenocarcinoma in situ identified (Block A16).  No definite residual invasive adenocarcinoma is seen.  The residual AIS is 9mm from the nearest ectocervical excision margin.  Within the cervix there are also some unusual deep glands which show tubal metaplasia (blocks A30,A32, A34).  No squamous dysplasia is seen.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is in late secretory faze.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  Sections of the right fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the ovaries are unremarkable.
B.  Sections show skin with underlying fat.  The described skin tag is an intradermal naevus.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable.  
C.  Sections showone lymph node.  No tumour is seen.
Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr E Arbry.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Focal residual AIS in cervix. 
B.  Pannus:  Intradermal naevus.
C.  Right low common iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1).
