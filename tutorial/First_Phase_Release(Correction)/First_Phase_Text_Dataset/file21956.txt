HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
BRCA1 carrier.
Left ovary and tube, right ovary and tube, endometrial curettings, pouch of Douglas

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE&amp;quot;.  A fallopian tube 45x15mm with attached part of ovary 25x20x10mm with unremarkable outer and cut surface.  Received also multiple fragments of ovary measuring 50x45x25mm in aggregate.  The fragments are of smooth outer surface and solid firm white areas.  Cystic corpus luteum is identified within the fragments measuring 24mm in maximum diameter.

(1-3 tube [1 fimbrial end two LS, 2&amp;amp;3 tube with adjacent part of ovary]; 4- 11 ovary [4 smaller fragments, 5 corpus luteum, 6-9 smaller fragments serially sliced, 10&amp;amp;11 largest fragment with solid area serially sliced]).  AE (M-11).

B.  &amp;quot;LEFT OVARY AND TUBE&amp;quot;.  A fallopian tube 35x5mm with unremarkable outer and cut surface.  Received also multiple fragments of ovary 2-25mm, 70x40x15mm in aggregate.  The cut surface reveals solid friable areas with minute papillary excrescences.

(1 fimbrial end two LS; 2 remainder of tube; 3&amp;amp;4 smaller scattered fragments; 5-7 each one smaller fragment serially sliced; 8&amp;amp;9 largest solid fragments in two blocks).  AE (M-9)

C.  &amp;quot;POUCH OF DOUGLAS&amp;quot;.  One piece of tissue 5x2x2mm.  AE (1-1)

D.  &amp;quot;ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS&amp;quot;.  Multiple mucoid pieces of tissue 15x15x5mm in aggregate.  AE (M-1/ZH 11/9/2067 nh)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr V Lucario)
A.  Histology shows evidence of a high grade serous carcinoma arising within the fimbria of the right fallopian tube adjacent to which foci of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma are present.  There is stromal invasion with desmoplasia and high grade cytological atypia, frequent mitoses with an occasional focus of tumour necrosis.  Deposits of serous carcinoma are also seen within the right ovary.  Immunostains show positivity for WT1, P16, PAX8, ER(60% 2+), PR (40% 2-3+), CK7. P53 is completely negative. Ki67 is approximately 80%.

B.  Histology shows much of the left ovary to be infiltrated by high grade serous carcinoma with identical morphology to that described above.  The left fallopian tube does not appear to be involved.

C.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with a small focus of metastatic high grade serous carcinoma.

D.  Histology shows most of the specimen to consist of mucus with occasional strips of endocervical and squamous epithelium.  No endometrial tissue is present.  This is a non-diagnostic specimen.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE -  HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA OF RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE INVOLVING THE RIGHT OVARY

B.  LEFT OVARY AND TUBE -
- HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA INVOLVING LEFT OVARY

C.  POUCH OF DOUGLAS -
- SMALL FOCUS OF METASTATIC HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA

D.  ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS -  NON-DIAGNOSTIC
