HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
? low grade appendix tumour.  Peritonectomy.  Rt colon + appendix.  Omentum.  Gallbladder. Peritoneum.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;GALLBLADDER, SMALL BOWEL, RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEUM&amp;quot;.
Gallbladder - A gallbladder measuring 70mm in length and 35mm in diameter. The external surface is smooth and shiny.  No cystic duct node present.  On opening the mucosa shows diffuse cholesterolosis.  No stones identified.

(1 TS resection margin; 2 two TS body; 3 one LS fundus).

Peritoneum - Multiple pieces of peritoneum with underlying fatty tissue attached, measuring in aggregate 90x90x50mm.  There are some rough areas and granular focal ? tumour.

(4-8 RS of peritoneum)

Omentum - Omentum measuring in aggregate 160x110x90mm. On sectioning the omentum there are no solid areas identified. Four possible nodes are found measuring up to 5mm in maximal extent.

(9 representative fat; 10 fat with three possible nodes; 11 further representative fat; 12 one node bisected)

Right hemicolectomy - A right hemicolectomy measuring up to 450mm in length including 20mm of terminal ileum and 250mm of ascending colon.  The appendix is present with a disrupted mass at the tip.  The appendix measures up to 55mm in length, and the mass measures 40x20x20mm.  The surrounding serosal surface has irregular granular areas ? tumor deposit.  The mucosa is unremarkable.

(13 possible serosal deposit; 14&amp;amp;15 paired LS distal appendix; 16 TS mid appendix; 17 LS proximal appendix; 18&amp;amp;19 irregular serosal areas)

Proximal resection margin inked black, distal green.

(20 LS resection margins; 21 apical node sectioned; 22 four possible nodes; 23 one bisected node; 24 four possible nodes; 25 one bisected node; 26 three possible nodes). RS (M-26/EE/ank)

MICROSCOPIC (Dr. M. Bracklin)
Sections through the appendix show a ruptured low grade mucinous appendiceal neoplasm.  Atypical mucinous epithelium is seen lining the residual appendiceal wall.  At the very tip of the appendix there is acellular dissecting mucin extending onto serosal surface.  Acellular mucinous deposits are also noted on the serosa of the small bowel and mesentery.  The rest of the small bowel mucosa and colonic mucosa show no focal abnormality.  Fourteen local lymph nodes examined including the apical lymph node show reactive changes.

Deposits of acellular mucin are also present on the serosa of the gallbladder, the surface of the omentum and separately submitted peritoneal fragments.

The gallbladder also shows changes of chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis.
Three omental lymph nodes examined show reactive changes.

No destructive tumour deposits are present.

DIAGNOSIS
GALLBLADDER, SMALL BOWEL, RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEUM :
-RUPTURED LOW GRADE MUCINOUS APPENDICEAL NEOPLASM WITH DEPOSITS OF ACELLULAR MUCIN IN APPENDICEAL MESENTERY AND APPENDICEAL SEROSA, SMALL BOWEL SEROSA AND MESENTERY, GALLBLADDER SEROSA, OMENTAL SURFACE AND SEPARATED SUBMITTED PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS.
