CLINICAL:
Leiomyosarcoma.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries&amp;#8221; consists of a hysterectomy specimen with bilateral tubes and ovaries.  The cervix measures 35 x 25mm with os measuring 5 x 5mm.  The uterus measures 65mm from cervix to fundus, 45mm (from left to right) and 37mm (anterior to posterior).  The left tube measures 50mm in length with a diameter of 8mm and the right tube measures 45mm with a diameter of 6mm.  The left ovary measures 35 x 15 x 10mm and the right ovary measures 33 x 15 x 10mm.  Within the endometrium on both anterior and posterior surfaces are polyps measuring between 2 and 5mm in size and within the cervix is a small cystic structure measuring 3 x 3 x 3mm filled with yellow material.  Anterior paracervical soft tissue margin inked blue, posterior cervical soft tissue margin inked black.  The left ovary contains a cystic area measuring 3 x 3 x 2mm filled with clear thin fluids.
Blocks:  1 to 3 &amp;#8211; LS full thickness anterior wall of uterus from cervix to fundus; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;#8211; RS polyp anterior wall of endometrium; 6 to 8 &amp;#8211; posterior LS uterus from cervix to fundus; 9 &amp;#8211; TS right ovary, TS right fallopian tube, TS fimbrial end right fallopian tube; 10 &amp;#8211; RS ovary inked in cystic area; 11 &amp;#8211; TS fimbrial end left fallopian tube, TS fallopian tube.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right paravaginal mass&amp;#8221; consists of two pieces of tissue.  The first measuring 95 x 85 x 90mm and the second measuring 150 x 100 x 95mm.  The surface of both pieces of tissue is smooth and encapsulated with one area on the smaller piece of tissue covered with a sheath of fibrous material.  The cut surface of the smaller piece of tissue displays a variegated yellow, white to pink appearance.  The cut surface of the larger piece of tissue has a variegated pale yellow to pink appearance.
Blocks:  1 to 7 &amp;#8211; RS smaller piece of tissue; 8 to 15 &amp;#8211; RS larger piece of tissue (11 &amp;amp; 12 &amp;#8211; paired block).  (TO: MS; MS/rt 5.5.66)
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr B Favazza)
A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is proliferative. The myometrium shows a leiomyoma and adenomyosis. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Sections of the right paravaginal mass confirm a leiomyosarcoma. The tumour has a heterogenous appearance and in areas shows features similar to that of the recent core biopsy (09N36082) with atypical spindled cells with myoid features arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Elsewhere, the tumour appears highly cellular and is composed of sheets of malignant epithelioid cells with vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm. Scattered highly atypical pleomorphic cells are seen. Mitoses are seen, up to 15 per 10 hpf, and include numerous atypical mitoses. Broad areas of coagulative (tumour) necrosis are seen, and involve up to 25% of the sampled tumour. Tumour is present within the lumen and wall of medium to large vessels at the periphery of the specimen. Whilst the tumour appears largely circumscribed, with an incomplete cuff of fibroadipose tissue, focally tumour extends along the periphery of the specimen and abuts the inked/diathermied surgical margin.
Representative slides seen with Dr B Dutch.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
Proliferative endometrium.
Leiomyoma and adenomyosis.
Ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.

B.  Right paravaginal mass:
Consistent with leiomyosarcoma.
Focal lymphovascular space invasion is present.
Margin involved.
