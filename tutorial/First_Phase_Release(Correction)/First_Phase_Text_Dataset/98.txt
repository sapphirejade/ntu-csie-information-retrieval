CLINICAL:
Laparotomy for SBO.  Findings of multiple omental and peritoneal nodule causing SBO + acute gangrenous cholecystitis.   1.  Omentum nodule. 2.  Small bowel.  3.  Gallbladder.  R1 rectal cancer on ULAR 2011, spinal stenosis.  Mets.  Neurofibromatosis.  AF.   
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fibro fatty tissue 60 x 40 x 20mm.  The specimen is seriallysliced.  There is a pale indurated nodule 24 x 15 x 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative of the nodule.
B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a segment of small bowel previously opened, 235mm long and up to 77mm in circumference.  The serosa has a haemorrhagic appearance.  There is an obstruction 20mm from one of the cut ends.  This cut end is inked blue after removing the staples.  55mm from the obstructed area there is an indurated serosal nodule 18 x 12 x 10mm and bulging towards the mucosa.  There are several lymph nodes within the mesenteric fat.  The mesenteric fat is up to 45mm across.   
Blocks: 1 & 2 - sections from the serosal nodule 55mm from the area of obstruction; 3 & 4 - comprise of one longitudinal section from the resection margin to the obstructed area; 5 & 6 - comprise one LS from the resection margin to the obstructed area; 7 - LS the opposite resection margin; 8 - up to four lymph nodes; 9 - one bisected lymph node; 10 - one bisected lymph node; 11 - one lymph node.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Gallbladder" consists of a disrupted and gangrenous gallbladder 85mm long and up to 70mm in circumference with the gallbladder wall ranging in thickness from 2 to 15mm.  The likely neck margin is inked blue.  
Blocks: 1 & 2 - LS the likely neck margin; 3 - TS body; 4 - LS the likely fundus.  
(PI/ta 7/4/62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr T Kerbo):
A. Sections show omental fat with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
B. Sections from the site of obstruction show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin.The lesion involves the muscularis propria, mesenteric fat, and is also invading an adjacent adherent segment of small bowel, resulting in kinking and obstruction of the small bowel. Probable lymphovascular invasion is focally present.  
A second deposit of tumour is present involving the submucosa, muscularis propria and mesenteric fat.
Both lesions are clear of the surgical margins of excision.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma is seen in 4 out of 12 lymph nodes.
Proximal to the surgical margins, the small bowel shows oedema, congestion and serositis, in keeping with the history of small bowel obstruction.
C. Sections of the gall bladder show acute gangrenous cholecystitis. There is full thickness infarction of the gall bladder wall associated with fat necrosis and fibrosis of the mesenteric fat.  An acute suppurative serositis is also present.
Multiple tumour emboli are present within the arteries.
DIAGNOSIS
A. Omentum: metastatic adenocarcinoma in keeping with colorectal origin
B. Small bowel:
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma associated with small bowel obstruction.
- Metastatic tumour in 4 out of 12 lymph nodes.
C. Gall bladder:
- Acute gangrenous cholecystitis.
- Arterial tumour emboli present.
