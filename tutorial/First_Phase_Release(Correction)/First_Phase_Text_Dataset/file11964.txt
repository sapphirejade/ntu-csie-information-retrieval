Pathology ReportCLINICAL:
30 cm mass on imaging presumed ovarian.  Ca 125 80. 41 weeks mucinous ovarian cyst tumour (FS borderline).  Washing TAH and BSO and appendicectomy and omental biopsy.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a multicystic ovary, 320 x 180 x 60mm with a fallopian tube 60 x 7 x 7mm.  The external surface is mostly smooth lined.  On sectioning the cyst also smooth lined with one small papillary area 20mm across.  There is also one mostly solid area approximately 30mm across.  Three representative sections for frozen section.
Blocks: 1 - frozen section one; 2 - frozen section two; 3 - frozen section three; 4 to 5 - fallopian tube; 6 to 32 - representative ovary (most of the papillary and solid areas).

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Borderline mucinous tumour with focal high grade atypia.
Phone result to Dr G Autullo by Dr Dr G Conzalez and Dr G Pelham at 1130hrs on 18.05.2016

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and right ovary weighing 94g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is up to 3mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is up to 17mm in thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 60 x 8 x 7mm.  The right ovary measures 30 x 28 x 20mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 5 to 7 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 8 - fallopian tube; 9 - ovary.

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Appendix&amp;quot;, consists of an appendix 85 x 6 x 6mm.  Mesoappendix is attached measuring 85 x 20 x 10mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The wall thickness is up 2mm and the mucosa is unremarkable.
Blocks: 1 and 2 - LS distal; 3 and 4 - TS mid; 5 and 6 - two LS distal and one TS proximal surgical margin in block 6.  AE.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omentum&amp;quot;, consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue 60 x 20 x 5mm and 50 x 20 x 10mm.  The omentum is unremarkable.  No lesions are identified macroscopically.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  (JL/vo 20.7.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Allridge &amp;amp; registrar Dr G Stuard):
A.  Sections show a mucinous tumour of the ovary.  The CK7 stain shows diffuse strong positivity. The CK20 and CDX2 stains show patchy postivity.  This staining pattern is consistent with an ovarian primary.  The tumour varies in morphology from a benign mucinous tumour to a borderline mucinous tumour with moderate to focally severe nuclear atypia, consistent with intraepithelial carcinoma.  The ovary is extensively sampled and no definite invasion is identified.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium contains foci of adenomyosis.  The right ovary contains a benign mucinous cystadenoma.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.   There is no evidence of malignancy.
C.  Sections of the appendix show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - D:  Uterus, cervix, left and right ovaries and tubes, appendix and omentum:
- Borderline mucinous tumour of the left ovary with focal intraepithelial carcinoma.
- No definite invasion identified.
- Benign mucinous cystadenoma of right ovary.
- Appendix normal.


ADDENDUM (26/7/66):
The case has been submitted for interdepartmental review.  The consensus opinion regarding the left ovarian tumour was that in addition to a borderline mucinous tumour with intraepithelial carcinoma, three small areas on invasive tumour are present measuring 1.5mm, 1mm and 0.5mm.
