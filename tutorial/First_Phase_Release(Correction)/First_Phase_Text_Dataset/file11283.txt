MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Eisermann):
Sections of vulval skin show severe dysplasia involving the full thickness of squamous epithelium.  The appearances are consistent with those of VIN 3.  The lesion is completely excised.  The lesion is 2.2mm to the 9 o&amp;apos;clock lateral margin and is well clear of the deep margin.  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy in the sections examined.

DIAGNOSIS:
Left anterior vulva - VIN 3, completely excised.
