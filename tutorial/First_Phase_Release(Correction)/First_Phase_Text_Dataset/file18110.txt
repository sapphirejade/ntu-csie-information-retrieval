HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
? appendiceal ca.  PC132.

MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;quot;SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RECTUM, COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, SMALL BOWEL&amp;quot;. Consists of multiple organs.

There is a gallbladder 90x40x40mm.  On the serosal surface there is an adherent piece of fibrofatty tissue 50x40x15mm.  No gallstones are identified within the lumen. The gallbladder wall thickness is up to 7mm. The mucosa is green and velvety.  In addition to the adherent fibrofatty tissue, there is also a 4mm area of roughened serosa.

(1 shave cystic duct margin and bisected cystic duct node; 2 shave section adjacent to the margin in 1, showing gallbladder neck, LS of fundus and TS of gallbladder body showing roughened area of serosa; 3&amp;amp;4 two sections of gallbladder body showing overlying adherent fibrofatty tissue)

The spleen weighs 231g and measures 150x90x35mm.  The capsule appears unremarkable. The parenchyma appears unremarkable.

(5 section of spleen including hilum and capsule; 6 further section of hilum of spleen; 7 further section of capsule of spleen)

There is a combined excision of right hemicolectomy, ileum and rectum, with attached peritoneum. The right colon measures 160mm in length and 72mm in open circumference. The average wall thickness is 4mm. The ileum measures 150mm in length and 40mm in open diameter. The average wall thickness is 4mm. The rectum and attached sigmoid is 370mm in length.  The open circumference is dilated and measures 95mm in length. The wall thickness is 3mm.  The rectum is adherent to the right colon.  In the right colon there is a pale firm tumour, 60x40x25mm. It appears to be largely replacing the appendix, the lumen of which is obliterated.  Attached to the right colon is a piece of mesentery 160x70x2mm.  It contains numerous firm deposits 2-3mm in size.  There appears to be peritoneal involvement and the rectum is attached to the right colon by pale white adhesions.

(8-10 CS showing tumour mass and adjacent ileum and serosa; 11&amp;amp;12 sections showing obliterated appendix lumen; 13 adjacent fatty tissue showing serosal involvement; 14 sections show roughened serosa and underlying rectum; 15 one node, serially sectioned; 16 one node serially sectioned; 17 one node serially sectioned [some of this node has been decalcified as it is not possible to cut due to calcification]; 18 one bisected node; 19 two nodes; 20 one bisected node; 21 one bisected node; 22 sections of deposits of pale tissue on peritoneum attached to right colon)

Also within the specimen jar is a segment of colon, 23mm in length and 130mm in open circumference. The average wall thickness is markedly thinned and measures 1.5mm. A suture is present which is presumed to represent an area of iatrogenic incision. There is up to 95mm of attached mesentery. There are small pale firm areas of white tissue on the mesentery, 2-5mm in size, which may represent deposits of tumour.

(23 RS of thinned bowel wall; 24 RS of pale areas on the mesentery)

There is a segment of small bowel, 190mm in length, and 50mm in open circumference.  The average wall thickness is 5mm.  There is up to 90mm of mesentery.  On the mesentery there are numerous pale firm deposits, 2-30mm in size.  In addition there is an area of firm yellow hard tissue on the serosa of the small bowel 8x5x2mm.

(25 sections of deposit overlying small bowel, attached to serosa; 26 two RS of deposit on mesentery; 27 further section of deposit on mesentery and underlying small bowel)

Also within the specimen jar is an unoriented excision of fatty tissue 270x20x70mm.  This lobulated  fatty tissue appears consistent with omentum.  There are large pale firm deposits within this tissue, up to 130mm in maximum extent.

(28&amp;amp;29 RS of pale white deposits within the lobulated fatty tissue, possibly omentum.

Also within the specimen jar are innumerable unoriented pieces of fibrofatty tissue containing pieces of mesentery, 2-450mm in size. Throughout these pieces of tissue there are innumerable pale firm deposits, 2-10mm in size.

(30 RS of tumour deposit on the fibrofatty tissue)

The remaining piece of tissue within the specimen jar is an unoriented ellipse of skin 28x22mm to a depth of 22mm.  In the centre of the skin is a tubular depression, 10mm in diameter, consistent with umbilicus.

(31 section through umbilicus; 32 further section of tumor deposit from the presumed omentum).  RS (M-32/LK/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr I Litaker)
Histology shows replacement of most of the appendix by a tumour characterised by small nests, glands and occasional single cells which have signet ring cell morphology and mild and moderate nuclear atypia. The tumour has spread through the full thickness of the appendix with multiple serosal, mesenteric and omental deposits with involvement of the serosa of the gallbladder, capsule of the spleen, serosa of the colon and small bowel with almost full thickness penetration through the wall of the rectum.  Seven out of nine local lymph nodes contain deposits of carcinoma.  Immunostains show variable positivity for Synaptophysin, Chromogranin which is moderately positive in some areas but negative in others with a Ki67 which is high at approximately 60-70%.  Overall morphology best fits that of adenocarcinoma ex-appendiceal goblet cell carcinoid with widespread dissemination. There is no involvement of the umbilicus and adjacent soft tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:
SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RECTUM, COLON, OMENTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, SMALL BOWEL -
- ADENOCARCINOMA EX-GOBLET CELL CARCINOID, SIGNET RING CELL TYPE, OF APPENDIX WITH WIDESPREAD SEROSAL, OMENTAL AND LYMPH NODE METASTASES.
