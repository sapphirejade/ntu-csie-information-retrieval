HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Superficial spreading melanoma in situ.
1. Left labia majora.
2. Right superior labia majora.
3. Right inferior labia majora.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;LEFT VULVA MARK ON 12 O&amp;apos;CLOCK&amp;quot;. A diamond shape piece of skin measuring 50x45mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 12mm.  A stitch is noted at one corner (12 o&amp;apos;clock). The 12 o&amp;apos;clock margin is inked blue, the 6 black. There is a flat variegated brown and tan lesion measuring 22x13mm, appears clear of the nearest 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin by 7mm.  The specimen is serially sliced from 3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock into 13 slices.  The cut surface reveals no definite areas of subcutaneous tissue involvement.

(1 TS 3 o&amp;apos;clock; 2 slice two; 3 slice three and four; 4-11 each one TS form 3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock across the lesion; 12 TS 9 o&amp;apos;clock).  AE (M-12)

B.  &amp;quot;RIGHT SUPERIOR VULVA&amp;quot;. Unorientated piece of skin measuring 20x13mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 8mm.  No definite skin lesions are identified.  The margins are inked blue. The cut surface reveals a unilocular cystic lesion filled with yellow friable material. The lesion is possibly encapsulated and 1mm of the nearest deep margin.

(1 TS peripheral end; 2 four TS mid across the lesion; 3 TS other peripheral margin).  AE (6-3)

C.  &amp;quot;RIGHT INFERIOR VULVA&amp;quot;. Unorientated piece of skin measuring 9x7mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 8mm.  No definite skin lesions are identified.  The cut surface reveals an ill defined cystic lesion with yellow friable material measuring 5mm and appears clear of margins.

(1 TS peripheral end; 2 two TS mid; 3 TS other peripheral end). AE (4-3/ZH/ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr B Arellanes)
A. The sections show skin and subcutaneous tissue. In the junctional zone, there is a lentiginous and nested proliferation of atypical melanocytes including focal Pagetoid intra-epidermal spread. In several areas, there is dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the junctional zone. There are also single cells and small nests of atypical melanocytes that are present in the dermis to a depth of 0.58mm (Clark level 3 - junction of papillary and reticular dermis). The invasive focus measures 4mm in width (block A6). No surface ulceration is seen. No necrosis is seen. There is less than 1 mitosis/mm2.
The appearances are those of in-situ and invasive melanoma (superficial spreading type).

In-situ and invasive melanoma is 6mm from the 12 o&amp;apos;clock margin (A3); is 8 mm from the 6 o&amp;apos;clock margin (A3); is approximately 8mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin (clear in adjacent blocks A1-A2), and is approximately 16mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin (clear in adjacent blocks A9-A12). Invasive melanoma is 5mm from the deep margin.

B. The sections show skin with epidermal cysts.

C. The sections show skin with inflamed/ruptured epidermal cyst. PAS stain is negative.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LEFT VALVA
- IN-SITU AND INVASIVE MELANOMA (SEE TEXT FOR DETAILS).

B. RIGHT SUPERIOR VULVA
- EPIDERMAL CYSTS.

C. RIGHT INFERIOR VULVA
- RUPTURED/INFLAMED EPIDERMAL CYST.
