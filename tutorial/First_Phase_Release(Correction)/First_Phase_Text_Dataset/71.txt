CLINICAL:
Endometrial Ca.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a opened uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and bilateral ovaries weighing 40g in total.  The uterus measures 60 x 40 x 20mm and has a smooth, shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium has an exophytic tan tumour at the left cornu which extends over an area of 25 x 20mm on the left anterior body to the right posterior uterine body.  The tumour is 33mm from the cervical os.  On sectioning the endometrium is 4mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 10mm in maximum thickness.  The tumour appears to infiltrate into the outer third of the myometrium.  The right fallopian tube measures 38mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension and the right ovary measures 12 x 7 x 6mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length x 7 x 5mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovarymeasures 20 x 11 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS of right body and cervix; 4 & 5 - further right body tumour; 6 - right parametrial tissue; 7 to 9 - full LS of left body and cervix; 10 - further section of left body tumour; 11 - left parametrial tissue; 12 - right fallopian tube; 13 - right ovary, AE; 14 - left fallopian tube; 15 - left ovary, AE; 16 bank.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Lupoe):
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 11mm through a wall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable. The parametrium, both ovaries and tubes are unremarkable.
 
DIAGNOSIS:
Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 11mm through awall 12mm thick.  No lymphvascular invasion.  Cervix uninvolved.
