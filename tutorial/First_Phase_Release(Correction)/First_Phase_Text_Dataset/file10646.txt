MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix weighing 55g in total. The uterus measures 70 x 45 x 30mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface. The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is up to 18mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is trabecular but unremarkable.  Blocks 1 to 3 &amp;#8211; full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 &amp;#8211; full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 to 9 &amp;#8211; remainder of posterior cervix, 10 &amp;#8211; further section of uterus.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right tube and ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a fallopian tube and adherent ovarian mass measuring in total 55 x 25 x 20mm.  The fallopian tube is unable to be separated from the mass.  Specimen serially sectioned.  On sectioning the mass is tan and fleshy with no areas of haemorrhage or necrosis identified. The mass is AE in 5 blocks.
C.   Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left ovary and tube&amp;quot;, consists of an adherent fallopian tube and ovarian mass measuring in 45 x 30 x 28mm.  The fallopian tube is unable to be separated from the underlying mass.  On sectioning the mass has a cystic appearance.  The cyst is smooth lined and filled with clear haemoserous fluid.  No solid areas are identified on sectioning.  The specimen is AE in 5 blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left peritoneal biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a ragged piece of haemorrhagic tissue with attached subcutaneous fat measuring 40 x 35 x 5mm.  The solid area is haemorrhagic and fibrotic.  Block 1 - haemorrhagic and fibrotic area; 2 &amp;amp; 3 - representative fibrofatty tissue.  AE.
E.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Ileum caecum&amp;quot;, consists of a right hemicolectomy including ileum and caecum. The ileum measures 410mm in length x 25mm in diameter.  The caecum measures 50mm in length x 45mm in diameter.  There is a dilated portion of the base of the appendix approximately 25mm in length x 15mm in diameter. The tip of the appendix appears ligated and fibrotic (? previous appendicectomy).  The serosal surfaces are haemorrhagic and there is an area of thickening and fibrosis along a portion of the ileum and caecum. This area is over 55 x 30mm (terminal ileum) and 40 x 20mm (caecum).  The wall thickness of the terminal ileum is approximately 5mm and of the large bowel approximately 10mm. The mucosa of both the ileum and large bowel is unremarkable and no polyps or lesions are identified.  Lymph nodes are found within the adherent mesocolon.  Block 1 &amp;#8211; proximal surgical margin; 2 &amp;#8211; distal surgical margin; 3 to 5 &amp;#8211; representative firm area over terminal ileum; 6 to 8 &amp;#8211; representative solid area on caecum; 9 &amp;#8211; TS base of appendix; 10 &amp;amp; 11 &amp;#8211; 1LS through appendix; 12 to 15 &amp;#8211; lymph nodes as seen.
F.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Gastrocolic ligament&amp;#8221;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 100 x 45 x 20mm.  One edge of the fat is haemorrhagic and fibrotic, 60 x 20mm.  The rest of the fibrofatty tissue is haemorrhagic but otherwise unremarkable.  Lymph nodes are found within the fibrofatty tissue. Block 1 to 3 &amp;#8211; possible lymph nodes; 4 to 6 &amp;#8211; fibrotic area.
G.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omentum nodule&amp;#8221;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 75 x 40 x 30mm.  There is a firm nodular area at the centre of the fat over approximately 25 x 10 x 10mm.  No other firm areas are found within the fibrofatty tissue.  One possible lymph node is identified.  Block 1 &amp;amp; 2 - representative fibrotic area; 3 &amp;#8211; one possible lymph node bisected.
H.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Omentum&amp;#8221;, consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue 300 x 100 x 25mm.  The omentum is covered with haemorrhage and appears firm and fibrotic across the length of the omentum.  On sectioning there are firm sclerotic areas infiltrating the fibroadipose tissue.  Representative resections of the fibrotic area in 3 blocks.  (JL/ec   5.11.66).

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Nowlan &amp;amp; registrar Dr Q Croxford):
A.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma on the serosa of the uterus.  An incidental focus of serous carcinoma in situ is also identified within the posterior endometrium.  The endometrium is otherwise inactive and the myometrium shows foci of adenomyosis.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.

B.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma situated predominantly on the surface of the ovary and within adnexal soft tissue.  The fallopian tube also shows extensive high grade serous carcinoma focally associated with in situ carcinoma of the tubal epithelium.

C.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma predominantly on the surface of the ovary and fallopian tube as well as adnexal soft tissue.

D.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma.
E.  Sections show high grade serous carcinoma predominantly situated on the serosa of the bowel with extension into subserosal adipose tissue of the small bowel and muscularis propria of the large bowel.  Carcinoma comes close to the bowel resection margins. Two (2) of the eleven (11) lymph nodes identified contain metastatic serous carcinoma.
F.  Sections show serous carcinoma.  In addition, two (2) of the four (4) lymph nodes identified contain metastatic serous carcinoma.
G.  Sections of omentum show serous carcinoma.  In addition, a single (1) lymph node contains metastatic serous carcinoma.
H.  Sections of omentum show serous adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - H.
-   High grade serous carcinoma, probable peritoneal primary
-  Tumour involvement of right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, uterine serosa, peritoneum, ileum and caecum, gastrocolic ligament and omentum.
-   Serous carcinoma in situ of left fallopian tube.
-   Incidental serous carcinoma in situ of the endometrium.
-   Five lymph nodes positive for metastatic serous carcinoma
ADDENDUM (18/4/67):
Immunohistochemistry for hormonal status has been performed as requested with the following result:
Block H2:
ER:  Strongly positive
PR:  Negative
ADDENDUM (18/10/67):
Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins (Block H2)
MLH1          Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2          Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2          Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6          Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
