CLINICAL:
Grade 1 endometrial cancer.


MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Uterus + tubes&amp;#8221; consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes, weighing 87g in total.  The uterus with cervix measures 70 x 50 x 30mm.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 24mm.  The posterior endometrial cavity has a granular appearance.  On sectioning, an ill-defined pale lesion is seen measuring approximately 28 x 28mm in surface dimensions.  Focally, this lesion extends into the myometrium to a depth of 10mm.  The myometrium is up to 14mm in thickness.  There are several intramural fibroids (mainly in the lower uterine segment) ranging from 7 to 25mm.  A subserosal calcified fibroid, 30 x 30 x 25mm, is noted adjacent to the fundus.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 7mm in diameter and the left ovary measures 30 x 12 x 5mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and 10mm in diameter and the right ovary measures 32 x 10 x 6mm.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - full LS anterior body and cervix, 4 to 15 - remainder anterior endometrium with possible lesion in blocks 11 to 15; 16 to 18 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 19 to 20 - posterior tumour with deepest invasion; 21 to 22 - fibroids; 23 - RS right fallopian tube; 24 - RS right ovary; 25 - RS left fallopian tube; 26 - RS left ovary.
B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of omentum measuring 80 x 25 x 5mm.  No distinct lesion is identified.  RS 3 blocks.   (TO: LN; LN/ua 10.10.66)


MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Salamy):
A.  The sections show a Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The tumour invades into the inner half of the myometrium with a depth of invasion of 4mm through a wall thickness of 12mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The myometrium shows focal adenomyosis.  Benign leiomyomas are confirmed.  The cervix, both fallopian tubes and ovaries are uninvolved by tumour.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining

Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

B.  The omentum shows patchy mesothelial hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus with cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
-  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
-  Tumour invades into inner half of myometrium.

B.  Omental biopsy:  No evidence of malignancy..
