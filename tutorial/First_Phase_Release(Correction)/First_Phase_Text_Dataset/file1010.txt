SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 2/11/65
HISTORY:
Peritonectomy. CRC. Anterior resection. Pelvic peritoneum. Diaphragm right peritonectomy.  Umbilicus.
MACROSCOPIC:
&amp;apos;OMENTUM, APPENDIX, RECTUM, PERITONEAL DISEASE, UMBILICUS&amp;apos;. Received in multiple fragments.
Rectosigmoid colon with attached peritoneum and appendix. The colon is 200mm in length and up to 50mm in diameter with attached mesocolon 80 mm wide and the distal 30 mm includes perirectal fat about 30 mm thick. The peritoneal reflection is about 30 mm from the distal margin. There is a large circumferential constricting pale tumour 70 mm in length in the colon partly (25 mm) inferior and partly superior (45 mm) to the peritoneal reflection (tumour site is upper rectum). The edges of the tumour are not raised. The tumour appears ulcerated. The tumour extends deeply (30 mm) into pericolic fat and into subserosal fatand is &amp;lt; 2 mm from the radial mesorectal margins and there is extensive involvement of the attached peritonuem. The peritoneum with tumour is adherent over the distal 100 mm of the anterior surface. Within this area of adherent peritoneum there is attached appendix 60 x 15 mm. The tip of the appendix is adherent to peritoneal tumour but no appendix lesion is seen. The anterior mesorectum is inked blue, the posterior is inked black. The serosal surface above the anterior peritoneal reflection includes multiple nodules (10-20mm), the largest measuring 40mm in maximum diameter. A segment of L vas 50 mm long is attached to the external surface
Distance of tumour to colon margins:
Proximal 110 mm
Distal 35 mm
Radial &amp;lt; 2 mm
Received also omentum, measuring 300x145x20mm with multiple (10-20) hard white nodules.
Received also an ellipse of umbilical skin, 35x23mm, representing an umbilicus. The underlying fibrofatty tissue measures 55x45x30mm. The resection margin is inked blue. The cut surface has a firm pale area in the fat.
Received also multiple fibrofatty pieces of tissue, measuring 145x60x30mm, with multiple similar nodules identified on the outer surface.
(1 colon proximal margin; 2 distal margin; 3 appendix base [two LS]; 4 appendix, two TS mid; 5and6 each one LS, tip of appendix in relation to adhesion; 7-9 tumour in relation to anterior peritoneal reflection; 10and11 tumour in relation to posterior radial margin; 12and13 representative serosal nodules above the peritoneal reflection; 14 representative nodules on the peritoneum; 15-17 lymph nodes above the anteiror peritoneal reflection, each four lymph nodes; 18and19 umbilicus with underlying nodule; 20-22 representative omental nodules; 23-25 representative nodules on smaller fibrofatty fragments). RS (M-25/ZH/cy)
FURTHER sections: 26,27 radial margin mesorectum, &amp;lt; 2 mm from tumour; 28 40 mm segment of attached L vas; 29 right side of mesorectal spread of tumour, not including surface; LV
