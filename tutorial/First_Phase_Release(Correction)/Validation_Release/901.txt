Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
High grade ca prostate.  Prostatectomy and pelvic node dissection. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate", consists of a prostate weighing 33.8g,measuring 48 x 25 x 45mm.  There are no seminal vesicles present (orientation confirmed with surgeon, base has been transected).  On sectioning there is extensive involvement by heterogeneous, firm grey/whitetumour tissue throughout all the slices.  Specimen serially sectioned from apex to base. 
Block 1-9 - apex, sagittally sectioned and embedded from right to left; 10-12 - full face prostate; 13-23 -base, sagitally sectioned and embedded from right to left. AE 23 blocks. Reserve tissue block after diagnosis please. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Right lymph node pelvic", consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring up to 30 x20 x 10mm.  There is at least one distorted lymph node present.  Serially sectioned, AE 2 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left lymph node pelvic", consistsof an irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 70 x 18 x 10mm.  On sectioning there is one fatty node which appears to be involved by tumour, and there are also other possible nodes. 
Blocks 1 & 2- serially sectioned, ?fatty involved node; 3 - remainder of fat and one possible lymph node; 4 - one possible lymph node. AE 4 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr H Ravenell) 
A.  Histological type:  Acinar adenocarcinoma.  
Tumour location:  Tumour involves the whole right and left posterior prostate (apex, mid prostate and base).  Tumour also extends around periphery of prostate bilaterally to involve right and left lateral prostate and also anterior prostate focally.  
Volume/Size:  9.6ml (25mm x 48mm x 20mm x 0.0004) 
Gleason score:  4(50%) + 5 (50%) = 9
Extraprostatic extension:  Extensive
Surgical margins:  Tumour at apical margin over a 16mm length.  Tumour multifocally at bladder base margin over a 48mm length.  
Perineural invasion:  Extensive
Seminal vesicles:  Not included
Lymph nodes:  See specimens B and C
Lymphovascular invasion:  Notidentified
DIAGNOSIS:

B.  Sections show four lymph nodes, all of which are completely replaced by metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.  There is also extensive involvement of extranodal fat and fibrous tissue by adenocarcinoma, including perineural and lymphovascular invasion.    
C.  Sections show six lymph nodes.  There is metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma partially involving one fatty node.  There is focal lymphovascular invasion in perinodal fat.  No other extranodal tumour is seen.  
DIAGNOSIS: 
A.  Prostate:  Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4 + 5 = 9.
Stage (AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition) pT4 pN1 MX.

B.  Right pelvic lymph nodes:  Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma in four nodes (4/4) and extensively involving extranodal soft tissue.
C.  Left pelvic lymph nodes:  Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma in one node (1/6).
