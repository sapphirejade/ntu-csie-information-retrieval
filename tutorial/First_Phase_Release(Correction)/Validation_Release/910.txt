Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Right hemi.  Caecal cancer.  Collitism (sic) anaemia.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 350mm in length with a section of terminal ileum 180mm in length.occupying almost the entire caecum is a circumferential ulcerated polypoid tumour 50 x 45mm.  The tumour appears to invade through the muscularis propria into the mesenteric fat.  Focally the tumour appears to abut the serosal surface and disrupt the appendix.  The appendix measures 50mm in length and 7mm in maximum external diameter.  Two polyps 8 and 5mm are identified, 65 and 120mm from the distal resection margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat, some of which appear macroscopically involved with tumour.
Blocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 - tumour to uninvolved mucosa; 3 to 6 - representative tumour; 7 - tumour to appendiceal orifice; 8 - small polyp; 9 - larger polyp; 10 - representative appendix; 11 - apical node; 12 to 14 - lymph nodes; 15 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 16 - one lymph node serially sectioned; 17 - reserve block.

Maximum tumour diameter:  50mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end: 180mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: 21	
Number of lymph nodes involved: 0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (Extramural, block 5)
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMXbe assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia x 2, margins clear.
Acute inflammation and organising fibrin present on serosal surface.
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
