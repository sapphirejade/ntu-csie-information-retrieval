CLINICAL:
Multiple lung nodules.  Resection L lung nodule 2062 - metastatic colon Ca.  Colectomy 2060.  Melanoma 2058.  PET +ve nodule basal segment R lower lobe.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Inferior pulmonary ligament" consists of two nodules 4mm each.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Superior nodule right lower lobe"consists of a wedge of lung 25 x 25 x 10mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  AE 3 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Basal right lower lung nodule" consists of a wedge of lung 40 x 25 x 20mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning there is an ill defined white solid lesion with necrotic centre 20 x 15 x 15mm.  The lesion abuts the surgical margin.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections of the tumour.   (DE/bl 24/3/63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Lasecki & Dr G Sefcik):
A.  The two(2) lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.  
B.  Sections of lung show acute haemorrhage only.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
C.  Sections show a circumscribed deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with luminal necrosis.  The appearance of the tumour is similar to the previous lung resection (23A09702) and is consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from a colorectal primary.  The tumour does not breech the pleural surface and comes to within 2mm of the surgical resection margin.  The remaining lung parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.  
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Inferior pulmonary ligament:  Two (2) negative lymph nodes.
B.  Superior right lower lobe lung:  No significant abnormality.  
C.  Basal right lower lung:  
-  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.
-  Excision appears complete.
