CLINICAL:
81 year old.  PMB.  Carcinosarcoma of ?endometrium ?cervix.  Concurrent small ductal breast cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix" consists of a uterus which is received opened and severely distorted and weighing 183g in total.  The uterus is unable to be orientated as to anterior and posterior and measures 85 x 80 x 65mm.  There is a lip of ?cervix attached at one end of the specimen which runs for a length of 75 x 22mm attached to one half of the opened specimen.  Several further fragments of cream/tan and haemorrhagic tissue are identified from 10 to 50mm in maximum dimension.  There is cream / necrotic tumour measuring 50 x 45mm in one half and 25 x 20mm over the other half. The cut surface reveals a cream and partly necrotic tumour invading to a maximum depth of 29mm over a total wall thickness of 30mm.  The tumour appears to come to 5mm from the ?cervical resection margin.  In the other uterine half the cream tumour appears to invade to a maximum depth of 5mm over a total wall thickness 14mm.  There is a large calcified fibroid measuring 60mm in maximum dimension identified.  A smaller fibroid 12mm which is also calcified is also identified.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full longitudinal section of one half of uterus; 5 to 7 - further sections of tumour to deepest point of invasion; 8 & 9 - tumour to cervical margin; 10 to 12 - full longitudinal section of other half of uterus and cervix; 13 & 14 - further representative sections of tumour at deepest point of invasion; 15 & 16 - calcifiedfibroid; 17 to 19 - representative separate fragments of tissue; 20 - reserved block; 21 to 25 - further tumour to cervical margin.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left ovary and tube" consists of a fallopian tube measuring 42mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 7mm.  The attached ovary measures 35 x 16 x 11mm.  The ovary has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a fallopian tube with ovary attached.  The tube measures 45mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 8mm.  The attached ovary measures 35 x 14 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Left vaginal lesion" consists of a polypoid piece of tissue 7 x 6mm to a depth of 3mm.  BAE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 55mm in length.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 1 to 15mm.  AE 2 blocks.  
F.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of two pieces of fatty tissue 30 and 45mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 2 to 13mm.  AE 2 blocks.
G.  Specimen labelled "Left common iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 22mm.  AE 1 block.
H.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 50mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified from 4 to 30mm.The larger lymph node appears macroscopically involved by tumour.  
Blocks:  1- ?lymph nodes; 2- representative involved node.
I.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental tissue 100 x 75 x 15mm.  No suspicious nodules are identified.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr G Gantvoort & Dr G Veals):
A.  Sections show carcinosarcoma of the endometrium.  The epithelial component is predominantly serous carcinoma together with large areas of squamous differentiation.  The mesenchymal component is predominantly comprised of malignant ovoid to spindle cells with foci of chondroid differentiation.   Approximately 60% of the tumour is carcinoma while approximately 40% is sarcoma.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Tumour focally involves adenomyosis.  
The tumour invades the myometrium to a depth of 24.5mm over a total wall thickness of 25mm.  The serosa appears clear of tumour by 0.5mm.  The specimen is received disrupted making margin assessment difficult however, tumour invades the endocervical stroma coming to within approximately 10mm of the cervical resection margin.  Carcinoma in situ extends into ectocervical squamous epithelium coming to within 7mm of the cervical resection margin.
The tumour shows strong positivity with ER within the epithelial component and is focally positive for PR.
B & C.  Sections of ovary and fallopian tube show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D.  Sections show vaginal squamous mucosa with no significant abnormality.  No discrete lesion is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
E.  Sections show eight (8) lymph nodes which are not involved with tumour.
F.  Sections show ten (10) lymph nodes which are not involved with tumour.
G.  Sections show one (1) lymph node which is not involved with tumour.
H.  Sections show three (3) lymph nodes.  One (1) of the lymph nodes has been replaced by metastatic carcinosarcoma measuring approximately15 mm across.  No extranodal spread is seen.
I.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A - I.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, vagina, pelvic lymph nodes and omentum:
-  Carcinosarcoma of the endometrium.
-  Invasion to a depth of 24.5mm over a total wall thickness 25mm.
-  Endocervix involved
-  Cervical margin clear of invasive tumour by 10mm
-  Cervical margin clear of in situ tumour by 7mm 
 - One (1) of twenty-two lymph nodes involved with metastatic carcinosarcoma.
-  Omentum negative
-  Vagina negative
