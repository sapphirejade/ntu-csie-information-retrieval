SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (30.10.63):


CLINICAL:
72 year old woman with ovarian/peritoneal cancer.  Received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Colonic polyps. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes & ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached adnexa weighing 77g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness with a polyp measuring 7 x 5 x 5mm.  The myometrium is 20mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains one fibroid measuring 15 x 12 x 12mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length and up to 5mm in maximum diameter; it shows signs of a previous ligation and close to the fimbrial end  there is a cyst measuring 20 x 15 x 15mm.  The right broad ligament has three tumour deposits measuring up to 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary has a cystic and solid appearance and measures 30 x 20 x 20mm.  On sectioning the cystic area is filled with serous fluid and the rest of the parenchyma has white/yellow nodules measuring from 4 to 10mm.   The left fallopian tube measures 70mm in length and up to 5mm in maximum diameter; it shows signs of a previous ligation and there are tumour deposits on the serosal surface at the fimbrial end.The left ovary measures 45 x 15 x 10mm.  It has a nodular solid area measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm.  The rest of the left ovary is unremarkable.   Blocks 1-3 - 1full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4-1 representative section of the fibroid; 5-7 - 1 full representative section of the  posterior body and cervix; 8-12 - right ovary AE; 13 - 2LS rightfimbria; 14 - representative sections of the right fallopian tube with cyst; 15 - broad ligament tumoral deposit; 16-20 - left ovary, AE; 21 - 2LS left fimbria with tumoral deposit; 22 - 2TS left fallopian tube.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Omental tumour", consists of a piece of omentum measuring 160 x 50 x 40mm.  Cut surfaces show numerous tumour deposits measuring from 2-10mm in maximum diameter.  Blocks 1-3 - omentum with tumoral deposit; 4 - tumour (block selected for tissue bank).  (GE/ec 28.8.62) 
  
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr O Wilhelmi) 
A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  A benign endometrial polyp is confirmed.  A leiomyoma is confirmed in the myometrium.  There is a single small deposit of poorly differentiated serous carcinoma showing treatment effect on the serosa of the anterior uterine body.  
Sections of the right ovary show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma within the ovaryand also a few deposits of similar tumour on the serosal surface.  Some of the tumour shows moderate treatment effect with replacement by fibroblastic tissue.  Overall the treatment effect is between 10-50% oftumour replaced by fibroblastic tissue.  Sections of the right fallopian tube are unremarkable.  A right paratubal cyst is confirmed.   Sections confirm the presence of tumour deposits in the right broad ligament; these deposits show treatment effect.  
Sections of the left ovary show a fibroma.  There is also poorly differentiated serous carcinoma within the ovary and on the serosal surface.  Sections of the left fallopian tube confirm the presence of a serosal tumour deposit at the fimbrial end. Tumour also extends into part of the tube wall.  No obvious abnormality of the tubal epithelium is identified.   
B.  Sections confirm extensive omental involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  This shows moderate treatment effect (overall 50-90% of tumour replacement by fibrous and fibroblastic tissue).  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, fimbrial end of left tube, right broad ligament and uterine serosa.  
B.  Omentum:  Serous carcinoma. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (30.10.63):
A.  Immunostains for hormone receptors have been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.
                                   100% of tumour cells show positive staining.intensity of staining:  Strong.
Progesterone receptor:  Positive.
                                       2% of tumour cells show positive staining.
                                       Predominant intensity of staining:  Moderate.
