CLINICAL:
Hx of multinodular thyroid with FNA showed suspicious of follicular neoplasm. For total thyroidectomy. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Left and right thyroid stitch at right upper pole", consists of a total thyroidectomy weighing 14g and measuring 35mm superior to inferior, 60mm medial to lateral and 15mm superficial to deep margin. The pyramidal lobe is identified measuring 15 x 5 x 5mm.  The tracheal margin is inked black, rest of surface blue.  The cut surface of the right hemithyroid is pink and unremarkable.  The cut surface of the left hemithyroid shows two nodules the largest is located in the mid pole and has a glistening appearance and measures 5mm in maximum diameter. A second nodule is located near the inferior pole, which has a solid tan cut surface with areas of calcification and measures up to 6mm.  The pyramidal lobe shows another nodule measuring 6mm in diameter.  The specimen is AE.
Blocks 1-4- right hemithyroid from superior to inferior; 5-9 - left hemithyroid from superior to inferior; 10 - pyramidal lobe.  (TO: XR: XM/ec 9.2.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported byDr I Gamberini) 
Sections of thyroid show nodular hyperplasia, colloid accumulation and nodule formation.  There is prominent Hurthle cell change.  Fibrosis and haemorrhage are also seen.  No parathyroid tissue is seen.  The appearances are consistent with those of multi-nodular goitre (adenomatous nodule).  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
DIAGNOSIS:
Left and right thyroid - Multinodular goitre.
