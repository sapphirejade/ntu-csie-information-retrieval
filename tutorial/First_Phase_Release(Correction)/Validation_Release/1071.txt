CLINICAL:
MMT of uterus.  Laparoscopic hysterectomy and BSO.  Enlarged uterus and enlarged right external iliac lymph node.  Type 2 diabetic.  
 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 189g in total.  The uterus measures 105 x 70 x 55mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 25mmand has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the uterus there is a large cream soft mass which appears to be arising from the endometrium.  The mass fills the entire cavity.  The uterine wall has a maximum thickness of 35mm.  The tumour does not appear to invade down to the serosal surface.  The central cavity is filled with haemorrhagic material.  The right fallopian tube measures 54mm in length x 7 x 5mm and the right ovary measures 20 x10 x 6mm. The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length x 7 x 5mm, the left ovary measures 25 x 10 x 7mm.
Blocks: 1 to 4 - full LS through anterior body and cervix; 5 to 10 - full LS through posterior body and cervix; 11 - further section of tumour with serosal surface; 12 - reserved block; 13 & 14 - full section through endometrium to serosa (paired blocks); 15 - further section tumour and serosa; 16 - sections of right ovary; 17 - LS of fimbrial end; 18 - TS of right tube; 19 - TS left ovary; 20 & 21 - left fallopian tube.(PY/ta 19.6.63) 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left external iliac lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 50 x 30 x 15mm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.  
Blocks:  1 & 2 - lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - multiple fragments of the one lymph node.
C.  Specimen labelled "Left obturator lymph node" consists of adipose tissue measuring 55 x 30 x 10mm.  
Blocks:  1 to 3 - lymph nodes.  
D.  Specimen labelled "Right external iliac lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 45 x 25 x 15mm contains one lymph node which measures 35 x 20 x 10mm.  Bisected and alllymph node material embedded in 2 blocks.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Right obturator lymph node" consists of fibroadipose tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 10mm.  Multiple lymph nodes identified.  All lymph node material embedded in 2 blocks.  (IP/mm 19.6.63) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Dottin):
A.  Sections of the uterus show grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with extensive areas of solid tumour.  No convincing sarcomatous component is identified.  The tumourinvades to a depth of 19mm through a wall thickness of 21mm.  Lymphovascular space invasion is seen.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The myometrium contains a leiomyoma.  Both fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality.  
B.   Four (4) of the fourteen (14) lymph nodes identified show metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen within adjacent adipose tissue.  
C.  Three (3)of the six (6) lymph nodes identified show metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
D.  One (1) of the three (3) lymph nodes identified show metastatic adenocarcinoma.
E.  The three (3) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - E.  Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, pelvic lymph nodes:
-   Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium. 
-   Invasion to a depth of 19mm through a wall thickness of 21mm. 
-   Lymphovascular space invasion present. 
-   Eight positive lymph nodes.
ADDENDUM (25/6/63):
Immunohistochemistry for hormonal status has been performed as requested with the following results:
ER and PR:  Strong positive staining within the majority of tumour cells.
