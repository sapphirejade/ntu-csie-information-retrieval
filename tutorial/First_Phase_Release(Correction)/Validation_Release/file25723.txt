MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and right ovary&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and right ovary weighing 1225g in total.  The uterus measures 150mm superior to inferior x 155mm medial to lateral (75mm cornu to cornu) and 80mm anterior to posterior.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 18mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The right ovary is 25 x 17 x 10mm and appears unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube is 65mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  .  The left fallopian tube is 55mm in length x 5mm in maximum diameter and appears unremarkable. On sectioning, a cream to dark brown fungating tumour is present involving the entire endometrial cavity and lower segment and extending down into the cervical canal.  This tumour extends to a depth of 20mm through a wall thickness of 25mm in the anterior lower uterine segment, and 20mm in depth through a wall thickness of 30mm in the posterior uterine body. A relatively well circumscribed 105 x 83 x 100mm firm cream lesion is also present within the myometrium of the right uterine wall, which may represent extension of the presumed endometrial tumour, or a separate lesion (?leiomyoma).
Blocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - right ovary and fallopian tube; 3 - left fallopian tube; 4 to 13 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 14 to 28 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 29 - tumour near left anterior cervix; 30 to 34 - ? leiomyoma anterior uterine body; 35 - tumour near posterior cervix (left); 36 - tumour near posterior cervix (right); 37 - tumour near posterior lower uterine segment (left); 38 to 41 - ? leiomyoma posterior uterine body.

B.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left ovarian mass&amp;quot;, consists of a 125 x 70 x 60mm firm lobulated ovary weighing 320g.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  On sectioning, the cut surface is diffusely pale yellow with occasional cream fibrous regions.  A 33 x 25 x 13mm thin walled cyst (&amp;lt;1mm wall thickness) is present at one end, with a smooth inner lining containing dark brown material.  No papillary excrescences or solid regions are identified.
Blocks:  1 to 10 - representative sections of tumour (block 4 with haemorrhagic cyst)

C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Omental biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of 85 x 65 x 25mm omental fat.  No lesions are identified.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.

D.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Posterior vaginal wall biopsy&amp;quot;, consists of a 5 x 3 x 3mm dark brown tissue.  AE 1  block.  (TO: KM; KM/eh 23/5/2066)

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Clerc):
A.  Sections show an very extensive grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium involving the entire endometrial cavity, lower segment, and the upper endocervical stroma.  The tumour has a maximum depth of invasion of 20mm through a wall 24mm thick.  No definite lymphvascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervix is uninvolved and ulcerated.  Tumour extends to within 8mm of the vaginal margin.
In addition the uterus shows a very large degenerating benign cellular leiomyoma.  Mitoses are scant, there is no significant atypia and no coagulative necrosis.
The right ovary and both tubes are unremarkable.
MSI stains are pending.

B.  Sections show a large benign thecoma which is focally luteinised.  An adjacent small serous cystadenofibroma is noted.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

C.  The omentum shows no evidence of malignancy.

D.  Sections show inflamed granulation tissue and fibrin.  There is no evidence of malignancy.


DIAGNOSIS:
Extensive grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, depth of invasion 20mm through a wall 24mm thick, endocervical stromal involvement present.  No definite lymphvascular invasion.  Omentum negative.  Large left ovarian luteinised thecoma.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 5/7/65:

Immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins:

MLH1:  Loss of nuclear staining
PMS2:  Loss of nuclear staining
MSH2:  Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6:  Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
This result was discussed with Dr C. Clamp on 5/7/65.
