HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Ileocolic lymph node - frozen.  Uterus, left ovary. PMP (low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm).  Redo peritonectomy.  Low grade appendix tumour peritonectomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;ILEOCOLIC LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Consists of a lymph node 14mm in dimension.  Bisected - all embedded for frozen section.

F/S : &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;. Reported to Dr. Tengan (anaesthetist) by Dr. N. Mccaslin at 1320Hrs on 12.11.19.

(1 FS).  AE (2-1) (MY 17/2/2069 ank)

B.  &amp;quot;UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY&amp;quot;. Consists of a hysterectomy specimen with attached left fallopian tube weighing 150g and consists of a uterus and cervix measuring 95x45x40mm.  The cervix measures up to 35mm  in length and 30mm from left to right with a 2mm slit like os.  The anterior cervix is inked black and posterior blue.  The overlying serosal surface of the uterus is smooth.  There is a possible adhesion lying at the left fundal aspect. Serial sections through the body of the uterus does not reveal any whorled, haemorrhagic or focal lesions.  The endometrium measures up to 2mm and the myometrium up to 20mm maximally posteriorly.  The left fallopian tube measures up to 80mm in length and ends in a blind sac.  It runs from the left side posteriorly behind the uterus crossing the uterine midline.  Serial sections of the fallopian tube reveal a dilated sac-like end.  The left parametrium is thickened and measures up to 30x30x25mm.  Serial sections through it reveal possible collapsed cystic structure.  No obvious ovarian tissue is identified.

(1 anterior cervix; 2 posterior cervix; 3 lower uterine segment; 4 posterior endomyometrium; 5 right parametrium; 6 uterine fundus + overlying serosa/adhesion; 7 proximal left fallopian tube; 8 left distal fallopian tube; 9&amp;amp;10 sections of the left parametrium).  (MY 13/1/2068 ank)

Further tissue:
Further sections from right adnexa and right ovary taken.

(11-16 further sections of ovary; 17-20 further sections of right adnexa). RS (M-10/MC 17/1/2066 cy)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr N Yeary)
A.  The paraffin sections of the lymph node confirm reactive changes only.  Negative for malignancy.
B.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. The endometrium shows late secretory phase appearances. The myometrium is unremarkable.  In blocks B5 and B7 (right parametrial and left adnexal regions) there are features of endometriosis as well as acellular pools of mucin which are associated with low grade mucinous epithelium in some areas including some low grade mucinous epithelium within connective tissue.
Sections of the ovary shows organising haemorrhagic luteineized follicular cyst. The fallopian tube is dilated but otherwise unremarkable.

Comment : The appearances are consistent with low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (PSOGI terminology) and consistent with the given history of low grade appendical mucinous neoplasm. Clinical correlation and correlation with previous pathology recommended.
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  ILEOCOLIC LYMPH NODE -
-NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

B.  UTERUS, CERVIX AND LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY -
-LOW GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI - SEE TEXT.
