CLINICAL:
Ovarian/peritoneal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Dizziness, chest tightness - in AF.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, right tube, cervix and right and left ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries.  The cervix is received separate.  The uterus measures 40 x 40 x 20mm and weighs 53.3g.  The external surface is shiny and smooth.  The endometrium has a maximum thickness of 1mm.  The myometrium has a maximal thickness of 12mm.  The external surface at the level of the lower segment appears ragged.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 18 x 16 x 10mm.The external surface is shiny and smooth.  On sectioning the cut surface is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and up to 5mm in maximum diameter.  Multiple paratubal cysts are identified measuring from 2 to 6mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 20 x 12 x 10mm.  The external surface is shiny and smooth with two small cysts measuring 2 and 5mm.  On sectioning the cut surface is unremarkable.  The cervix measures 45mm in length and 20mm in maximum diameter.  The cervical mucosa is pink and shiny with multiple petechial haemorrhages.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.   
Blocks:  1 & 2 - composite of longitudinal section of cervix; 3 & 4 - composite of longitudinal section of cervix; 5 & 6 - one full longitudinal section of anterior endomyometrium; 7 & 8 - one full longitudinal section of posterior endomyometrium; 9 - two representative sections of the rightovary; 10 - one representative of ovary and one TS right fallopian tube; 11 - two LS right fimbria; 12 to 14 - left ovary; 15 & 16 - two LS of left fimbria; 17 - right parametrial tissue; 18 - left parametrial tissue.
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 180 x 140 x 25mm.  The omentum appears thick and solid with numerous tumoral deposits.  On sectioning the cut surface appears solid with white and yellow glistening areas comprising approximately 95% of the surface.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - three representative sections in 3 blocks; 4 - tissue for tissue bank.  
(PG/mm 16.8.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr U Sozio):
A.  Sections show small deposits of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma on the surface of both ovaries, in the paradnexal soft tissues and in the parametrial soft tissues.  Carcinoma in situ is present in the left fimbriae.  The tubes are otherwise uninvolved.
The ectocervix and endocervix are unremarkable.  The endometrium is inactive.  The myometrium is unremarkable.
B.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of probable peritoneal origin extensively involving the omentum, also involving the surface of both ovaries and the paradnexal and parametrial soft tissues.
