CLINICAL:
Extended right hemicolectomy for hepatic flexure bowel Ca
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "R colon" consists of a right hemicolectomy which includes 220mm of large bowel and 70mm of ileum.  There is an attached appendix which measures 75mm in length by 10 x 10mm.  Onopening the bowel there is a polypoid tumour near the distal margin which measures 60 x 50mm and is macroscopically located 16mm from the distal margin.  There is attached fat which measures 70 x 110mm.  There appears to be a radial margin involving the fat which measures 220 x 110mm.  Radial margin inked black, bowel margins inked blue.  On sectioning the tumour appears to invade into themuscularis propria and abut the serosa. No other mucosal lesions or polyps are identified.
Blocks: 1- ileal margin; 2 to 4- shave of the distal margin; 5- LS of tumour with normal mucosa; 6 and 7- composite blocks tumour at level of deepest invasion;8 and 9 composite blocks tumour to closest mesenteric margin;10- ileal caecal valve; 11- one lymph node bisected; 12- lymph node adjacent to radial margin bisected; 13- lymph node adjacent to radial margin;  14 and 15- lymph nodes; 16 one lymph node bisected; 17- lymph nodes adjacent to radial margin; 18- one lymph node trisected adjacent to radial margin; 19-  serial LS of the distal tip of appendix; 20- representative TS appendix.   (TO: AU;UW/vo 8.7.63) 21- 23 -each one node (LV8.8.63)
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Rubinstein):
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features. The tumour has the following features: 

Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Hepatic flexure. 	
Maximum tumour diameter:     60mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:    16mm
Tumour perforation: No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS with mucinous features; mucinous component <50% of tumour.
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate 
Local invasion
pT2	Invasion into muscularis propria (block 7)
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin: N/A. 
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  Well clear (>10mm from mesenteric margin). 
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present: 12	
Number of lymph nodes involved: 0.	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Other:  
The tumour is associated with a villous adenoma with high grade dysplasia.  
Away from the tumour the small and large bowel mucosa is unremarkable.
Tattoo dye is present within histiocytes within the submucosa and subserosa close to the tumour. 
The appendix is unremarkable. 
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status:
To follow.	

Summary - TNM 7th Edition

-   Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features; no perineural or lymphovascularinvasion seen. 
-   Twelve (12) negative lymph nodes (0/12).
-   Stage pT2 N0 MX.
-   Mismatch repair protein status tofollow.
			
	ADDITIONAL REPORT (17.9.63)(Reported by Dr Q Gocek)

Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		loss of nuclear staining (abnormal)
PMS2		loss of nuclear staining (abnormal)
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated withmicrosatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
