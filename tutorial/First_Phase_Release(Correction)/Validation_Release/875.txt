CLINICAL:
Previous granulosa cell tumour, raised inhibin.  History of granulosa cell tumours - now bilateral pelvic masses and abdominal wall mass.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal mass", consists of an ellipse of skin with underling fatty tissue 50 x 22mm to a depth of 50mm. The skin surface appears normal.  A 25mm firm cystic mass with one solid area approximately 10mm across is present with subcutaneous fat.  Two representative frozen sections.
Block 1 - FS block 1; 2 - FS block 2; 3-5 - further representative mass; 6 - representative skin.
FROZEN SECTION:  Tumour consistent with granulosa cell tumour. 
Result to anaesthetist by Dr Hangartner at 10am on 28.11.12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right side wall mass", consists of a predominantly cystic mass 60 x 40 x 18mm with a smooth external surface.  Sectioning reveals clear coloured fluid contents. The internal surface of the cystic mass is also smooth.  Representative sections 3 blocks.
C.  Specimenlabelled "Left pelvic tumour", consists of multiple fragments of friable tan tumour partly covered by peritoneum 95 x 75 x 20mm in aggregate.  Representative 9 blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled "Right lower anterior abdominal wall nodule", consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 9 and 12mm in maximum dimension. AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic side wall", consists of a ragged piece of fibroadipose tissue 25mm in maximum dimension.  BAE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Bladder nodule", consists of three pieces of fibroadipose tissue 4, 6 and 15mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block (largest piece bisected).
G.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid mass", consists of a 35 x 25 x 22mm partly cystic and partly solid tumour nodule attached to a 20mm stalk of fibroadipose tissue.  Representative 3 blocks.
H.  Specimen labelled "Rectal nodule", consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue 8 and 13mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block (largest piece bisected).
I.   Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of a 190 x 75 x 10mm piece of macroscopically unremarkable omentum. Representative 3 blocks.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr CEdgar):
A.   Paraffin sections confirm moderately differentiated granulosa cell tumour.
B.   Sections show a cystic structure lined by tubal type epithelium with surrounding smooth muscle consistent with a hydrosalpinx.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
C.   Sections show moderately differentiated granulosa cell tumour.  There is ER stain is weak to moderate and the PR stain is strongly positive.
D.   Sections show moderately differentiated granulosa cell tumour.
E.   Sections show fibroadipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
F - H.  Sections show moderately differentiated granulosa cell tumour.
I.    Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - I.  Abdominal mass, peritoneal biopsies and omentum:
-   Moderately differentiated granulosa cell tumour involving abdominal wall, left pelvis, bladder, sigmoid and rectum
-   Omentum negative.
-   Left hydrosalpinx
CORRECTION (7/2/62):
The hydrosalpinx is situated on the right side according to specimen labelling.
