CLINICAL:
Endometrial ca - grade 1.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries, cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 136g. The uterus measures 90 x 80 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a tumour within endometrial cavity measuring roughly 45x 44 x 12mm.  The tumour has a friable surface.  It appears to be contained within the inner half of the myometrium. The myometrium contains a fibroid 15mm in maximum dimension.Also there are two subserosal fibroids loosely attached to the posterior serosal surface, 15 and 14mm in maximum dimension. The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and up to 9mm in diameter. The right ovary is 22 x 21 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is 42mm in length and up to 8mm in diameter. The left ovary measures 27 x 20 x 17mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.    
Blocks 1-6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (3/4, 5/6 - paired); 7-12 - full LS of anterior bodyand cervix (9/10, 11/12 - paired); 13 & 14 - sections of tumour, posterior ; 15 - section of tumour, reserved block for tumour bank; 16 -section of tumour, posterior body of uterus; 17 - representative section of the myometrial fibroid; 18 - one subserosal fibroid bisected; 19 - the other subserosal fibroid bisected; 20 - representative section of right ovary; 21 - representative right fallopian tube; 22 - representative left ovary; 23 - representative left fallopian tube; 24 - tumour in relation to serosal surface, anterior.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr N Hernandes - 10.3.2062)
Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma of the uterus. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded glands with variably desmoplastic stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). Very occasional foci of solid growth are seen but these comprise less than 5%. The adenocarcinoma infiltrates into the outer half of the uterine wall with a maximum depth of invasion 20mm, through a wall 27mm thick (block 24). There is no convincing lymphovascular space invasion or serosal involvement.The presence of multiple benign leiomyomas is confirmed. The cervix and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant histologic abnormality. 
Representative slides seen with Dr N Gutmann.
DIAGNOSIS: 
Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes:
Uterine FIGO Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.
