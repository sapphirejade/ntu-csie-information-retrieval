Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Interval debulking for serous Mullerian tumour, neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  BMI increase.  Diverticular disease, OA, GORD, recent L humerus #.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighting 136g in total.  The uterus measures 90 x 55 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 40 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium has a nodular surface with multiple small (<1mm) vesicle-like projections on the posterior and anterior surface over an area of 25 x 20mm (posterior) and 21 x 25mm (anterior).The rest of the endometrium is 2mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium is 25mm in maximum thickness and contains several fibroids ranging from 2 to 20mm in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube is in two segments (previous tubal ligation).  The proximal blind ended tube measures 20mm in length x 5 x 5mm in diameter.  The distal fallopian tube measures40mm in length x 7 x 5mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 30 x 20 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube is in two segments.  The proximal segment measures 15mm in length x 7 x 6mm in maximum diameter and the distal segment measures 40mm in length x 7 x 6mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 32 x 15 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS section of posterior body and cervix; 4 & 5 - representative endometrial tumour posteriorly; 6 to 9 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 10 - representative endometrial tumour anteriorly; 11 - right proximal fallopian tube; 12 - right distal fallopian tube; 13 - right ovary; 14 - right parametrial tissue; 15 - left proximal fallopian tube; 16 -left distal fallopian tube; 17 - left ovary; 18 - left parametrial tissue.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 300 x 100 x 20mm and 120 x 60 x 20mm.  Throughout the larger omentum there are solid deposits of tumour.  The largest deposit measures 70 x 40 x 30mm.  Representative in 3 blocks.  (JL/ta 21/8/63) 
 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr T Dahme):
A.   The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium shows cystic atrophy with a benign endometrial polyp. Themyometrium shows leiomyomas.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
B.  Sections of omentum show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of probable serous type.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A & B.  Uterus and cervix, tubes and ovaries, omentum:
-   Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within omentum, probable serous type.
-   Fallopian tubes and ovaries normal. 
-   Probable peritoneal primary.
-   Leiomyomas and benign endometrial polyp
