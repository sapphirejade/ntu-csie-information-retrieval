CLINICAL:
Curettings - grade 1 endometrioid adenoca.  TLH/BSO. Mismatch repair Immunohistochemistry please. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Bilateral tubesand ovaries, uterus, cervix", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 98g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 60 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 36 x 34mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On section, the endometrium is less than 1mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids each 10mm in maximum diameter. The right fallopian tube measures 50mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter. The fimbria is present and appears unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 30x 15 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 40mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter. The left ovary measures 35 x 15 x 15mm and has an unremarkable cut surface. Blocks 1-3 - one full LS of anterior body and cervix; 4-6 - rest of anterior endomyometrium; 7-9 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 10-16 - rest of posterior endomyometrium. (The endometrium has been AE); 17 - right parametrial tissue; 18 -left parametrial tissue; 19 - right fimbria and fallopian tube; 20 - right ovary, representative sections; 21 - left fallopian tube and fimbria; 22 - left ovary. (TO: HC: MM/ec   30.5.64) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr T Devotie) 
The sections show foci of residual endometrioid adenocarcinoma FIGO grade 1 (slide 13 and 14) invading 1 mm in a myometrium 10mm thick. No lymphovascular invasion is seen. The uninvolved endometrium shows areas of simple hyperplasia without atypia.  The uterus also shows intramural leiomyomata with no atypical features and areas of adenomyosis (slide 16).  The tumour does not involve the parametria, cervix, fallopian tubes or ovaries.  No fallopian tube dysplasia is seen. 
CONCLUSION
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma FIGO grade 1.
COMMENT
Immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins has been requested on the previous specimen 79Z04856 (endometrial curettings, 5.7.64) and a supplementary report will be added to this report when the stains are available.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.3.64)

Immunoperoxidase stains were done on block 1, 79Z04856.
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Loss of nuclear staining in tumour cells
PMS2		Loss of nuclear staining in tumour cells
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining in tumour cells
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining in tumour cells
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
