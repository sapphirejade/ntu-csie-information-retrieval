CLINICAL:
Known grade I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma on curettings.  TLHBSO asdefinitive surgery.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes, ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 84.3g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 45 x 35mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 24mm and has an unremarkable surface.  There is a fungating tan tumour within the endometrial cavity measuring 35 x 30mm (anteriorly) and 35 x 15mm (posteriorly).  Macroscopically the tumour appears to invade 3mm into the myometrium which is 19mm in maximal thickness.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length, 5mm in external diameter.  The right ovary measures 21 x 12 x 10mm.  It has a smooth external surface and grossly normal cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 50mmin length, 5mm in external diameter.  The left ovary measures 19 x 14 x 10mm and shows no macroscopic abnormality.  Representative sections in 24 blocks.  
Blocks:  1 to 4 - full LS anterior body and cervix; 5 to 8 - further sections anterior body; 9 to 12 - full LS posterior body and cervix; 13 & 14 - further sections posterior body; 15 to 17 - right fallopian tube all embedded; 18 & 19 - right ovary all embedded; 20 to 22 - left fallopian tube all embedded; 23 &24 - left ovary all embedded.  (TO: XB; BH/mm 13.2.62) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Gomey): 
Sections of the endometrial tumour show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 13mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 16mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  There is no cervicalinvolvement.  Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes do not show any significant abnormality.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrial invasion, stage 1B.
