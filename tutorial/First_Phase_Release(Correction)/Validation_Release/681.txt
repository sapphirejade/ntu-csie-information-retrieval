CLINICAL:
Endometrial cancer.  Pancreatitis, hypertension, chronic renal impairment, gout, hypothyroidism.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix" consists of a uteruswith attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 198g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 65 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is completely replaced by pale friable tumour measuring 32mm in maximum thickness, invading into the outer half of the myometrium.  It is difficult to assess the thickness of myometrium but is estimated to measure up to 20mm.  The tumour appears to invade into the parametrial tissue at the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length and 3mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 10mmand has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 30mm in length and 2mm in maximum diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 5mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 7 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 8 to 14 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (block 12 - with the deepest point of invasion, for tumour banking); 15 - section of tumour embedded into parametrial tissue on the left side; 16 - right corneal; 17 - left corneal; 18 - right parametrial; 19 - left parametrial; 20 - representative TS right ovary and fallopian tube; 21 - representative TS left ovary and fallopian tube.    (PN/ta 11/3/64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Ebia): 
Sections show of the endometrial tumour show a grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma.  Some of the tumour consists of well formed endometroid glands but there is a significant (>50%) solid component so overall it is grade 3.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 30mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 31mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  Tumour is confirmed to directly extend into left parametrial soft tissue and there is invasion of a medium size muscular vein in this region (block 15).  There is quite prominent multifocal tumour involvement of the surface of the endocervix and also some involvement of endocervical glands but no cervical stromal invasion is seen.  Tumour involving the surface of the endocervix is 8mm from the nearest ectocervical excision margin.  There is a small amount of uninvolved endometrium and this shows features of exogenous hormone effect.
Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.  


DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrialinvasion and direct invasion into left parametrial soft tissue.  Tumour involvement of surface of endocervix.  Multifocal lymphovascular invasion.
