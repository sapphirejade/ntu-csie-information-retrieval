CLINICAL:
Ca prostate high risk.  A period of ADT pre op.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Prostate"consists of a prostate 55 x 45 x 35mm and weighing 48g.  The right vas deferens measures 20mm and the left 18mm in length.  The right seminal vesicle measures 20 x 9 x 7mm and the left measures 20 x 12 x 7mm.  Posterior margin is inked black, anterior inked blue and right is inked red.  The prostate is transversely sliced into seven slices.  Sliced 1 and 7 and are further parasagittally sectioned.  Specimen AE.  Please see the diagram.  
Blocks: 1 - left seminal vesicle; 2 - right seminal vesicle; 3 - left vas deferens; 4 - right vas deferens; 5 to 10 - slice 1 from right to left (apex); 11 to 15 - slices 2 to 6; 16 - 29 - slice 7 (base) from right to left.  AE.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right pelvic lymph node" consists of fragments of fatty tissue 55 x 45x 15mm in aggregate.  Specimen is serially sliced.  Two lymph nodes are identified 16 and 8mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 - one bisected lymph node; 2 - one lymph node
C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelviclymph node", consists of fatty tissue 65 x 50 x 15mm in aggregate.  Few lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 22mm in maximum dimension.
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes as seen; 2 - one bisected lymph node; 3 and 4 -  one lymphnode.
D.  Specimen labelled "Left iliac lymph node" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35 x 27 x 15mm.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - lymph nodes. AE.  (XX/vo 23.4.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Sudbury & registrar Dr A Manusyants):
A - D.  Sections show acinar adenocarcinoma, thefeatures are as follows:
