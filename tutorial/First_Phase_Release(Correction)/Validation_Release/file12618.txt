CLINICAL NOTES:
R breast ca upper outer quadrant, right sentinel lymph node for frozen section. R breast ca upper outer quadrant.

1. Right breast wide local excision.
2. Re-excision of superior margin R breast.
Sutures short-superior, medium-medial, long-lateral.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. &amp;quot;RIGHT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE&amp;quot;. Two lymph nodes.
1. 13mm.
2. 6mm.

F/S: &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot;. Results were given by phone to Dr. Lewis at 3:45pm on 3/04/2019 by Dr. U. Quercioli.

MUSCLE:  No
OTHER TISSUES / PIECES:  Not applicable.
MARGIN INKED:  Standard: Anterior blue, Posterior black, Superior red, Inferior green.
DISSECTION: Cut from medial to lateral
Number of slices:  8
FINDINGS / LESION:  There is a circumscribed somewhat well demarcated tumour with a pale tan appearance noted in slices 5 and 6. The tumour measures 5mm superior to inferior x 5mm anterior to posterior x approximately 8mm medial to lateral. It abuts the posterior margin but does not appear to involve it. It is 4mm from anterior, abuts superior margin, 20mm from inferior, 9mm from lateral and 16mm from medial margin. Entire specimen is embedded.
