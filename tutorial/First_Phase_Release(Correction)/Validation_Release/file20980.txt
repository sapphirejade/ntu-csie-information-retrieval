HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:

HISTORY:
Appendix ca.  Peritonectomy.  ? stomach involvement. Frozen section.

MACROSCOPIC:
A.  &amp;quot;STOMACH SURFACE&amp;quot;.  Consists of an oval piece of tissue 7x5x2mm.

F/S : &amp;quot;No evidence of malignancy&amp;quot;.  Reported to Dr. Maiers by Dr. M. Michitsch at 10:00 am on the 26/4/15.  AE (1-1)

B.  &amp;quot;SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, PERITONEAL DISEASE&amp;quot;. Consists of gallbladder, spleen, right hemicolectomy and multiple pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum.  The gallbladder measures 80mm in length with a maximum diameter of 35mm. The serosa is smooth and unremarkable. The wall is up to 2mm thick.  Mucosa is granular green in appearance.  There are no stones found within the lumen.

(1 cystic duct neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).

Spleen weighs 228g and it measures 110x80x45mm.  The capsular surface shows some areas of roughening ? tumour deposit.  Noted at the hilum and attached to the hilar fat is a mucinous deposit of tumour.  On sectioning, the splenic parenchyma is beefy red.  No lesion noted within the parenchyma.

(3&amp;amp;4 sections of tumour attached to hilar fat; 5 capsular roughening [4 tumour block])

Right hemicolectomy - it comprises of terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon with attached mesocolic fat.  Appendix is not present.  It measures 220mm in length (terminal ileum 75mm, ascending colon 150mm).  Proximal margin is 50mm distal margin, distal margin 40mm.  Attached mesocolic fat is up to 55mm wide.  The serosa shows areas of roughening.  On opening the mucosa shows normal mucosal folds. There is a possible polyp at the proximal ascending colon measuring 7mm maximum dimension.  No other discrete lesions are identified.  Proximal margin inked blue, distal black.

(6 proximal and distal margins; 7 polyp; 8 two sections through roughened serosa; 9 section through appendiceal orifice at caecum; 10-12 eight possible nodes [10 six nodes, 11&amp;amp;12 one node bisected each])

The separate pieces of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum altogether measures 250x150x50mm.  The pieces are covered by a mucinous tumour deposit.  One of the fatty pieces is consistent with omentum and is covered by mucinous tumour deposit.

(13&amp;amp;14 sections of peritoneum involved by mucinous tumour; 15 section of fatty tissue consistent with omentum).  RS (M-15)

C.  &amp;quot;ILIAC LYMPH NODE LEFT&amp;quot;.  Consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35x30x12mm with one possible node 20mm.  Bisected. AE (1-1)

D.  &amp;quot;NODULE FROM BLADDER&amp;quot;. Consists of a piece of fibrous tissue 10x7x4mm.  AE (1-1/MC 29/9/2068 ank)

MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr M Fielding)
A.  Paraffin sections show benign fibromuscular tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

B.  Sections show involvement of the serosal surface of the neck of the gallbladder, the capsule and hilar aspect of the spleen, the serosal surface of the right hemicolectomy segment and fragments of peritoneum by low grade mucinous neoplasm (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis - Ronnett / low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei - Bradley).
The involvement is characterised by numerous lakes of mucin dissecting through tissue planes.  Many of the mucin lakes are rimmed by atypical mucinous epithelium.  The tumour is overall of low to moderate cellularity, and there are two small foci of questionable destructive invasion interpreted as increased proliferation (block B15).  There are no definite high grade nuclear or architectural features and signet-ring cells are not seen.  Seven benign reactive pericolic lymph nodes are identified.

The parenchyma of the spleen is unremarkable.  The mucosa of the gallbladder shows features of mild chronic cholecystitis.  The small and large bowel mucosa sampled is unremarkable.  No polyps are identified in the segment of bowel.

Sections from the region of the appendiceal orifice shows irregular scar tissue in the submucosa and muscularis with occasional suture granulomas.

C.  Sections show one benign reactive lymph node.

D.  Sections show a portion of inflamed scar tissue with focal surface peritoneum.  The fibroblastic scar tissue includes clefts containing acellular extracellular mucin.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.  STOMACH SURFACE BIOPSY -  NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

B.  RIGHT HEMICOLON, GALLBLADDER, SPLEEN AND PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS -
- INVOLVEMENT OF THE SPECIMEN BY LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM (DISSEMINATED PERITONEAL ADENOMUCINOSIS / LOW GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI)
- INVOLVEMENT OF THE SEROSAL ASPECT OF THE HEMICOLON, GALLBLADDER AND SPLEEN
- INVOLVEMENT OF THE PERITONEAL FRAGMENTS

C.  LEFT ILIAC LYMPH NODE -  ONE BENIGN REACTIVE LYMPH NODE

D.  NODULE FROM BLADDER  -
- ORGANISING EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN WITHIN SCAR TISSUE.
