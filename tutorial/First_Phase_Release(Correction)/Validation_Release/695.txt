DR LOURDES EVANGELINE CARDONIA
Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Left ovarian mass, omental cake, elevated Ca-125, malignant ascites.  Previous hysterectomy.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of a disrupted cystic lesion measuring 75 x 60 x 35mm.  The external surface is partly covered by fat and muscle.  The internal surface is covered bybloodclot with solid areas and papillary excrescences.  The fallopian tube cannot be identified macroscopically.  The solid areas have areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.
Blocks:  1 to 10 - representative sections from lesion (block 10 - tissue for tissue bank).
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube" consists of a piece of fibrous haemorrhagic tissue measuring 70 x 30 x 15mm.  It has multiple small nodular areas measuring up to 10mm in maximum diameter.  The fallopian tube cannot be identified macroscopically. AE in seven blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Gastrocolic omentum" consists of two pieces of omentum with multiple tumour deposits.  The biggest piece of omentum measures 150 x 50 x 20mm and the smallest one measures 60 x 20 x 15mm.  Representative sectionsin three blocks.
D.  Specimen labelled "Bladder peritoneum" consists of a piece of peritoneum covered by fibrinous exudate.  It measures 60 x 20 x 2mm.  Representative sections in two blocks.
E.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid tumour" consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue covered by blood clot measuring in aggregate 50 x 30 x 10mm.  Representative sections in two blocks.
F.  Specimen labelled "Omentum and umbilicus" consists of a big piece of omentum.  Measuring  190 x 110 x 20mm.  The umbilicus measures 50 x 20mm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The omentum is thick and totally replaced by a white and glistening tumour.
Blocks:  1 - one TS from umbilicus; 2 & 3 - representative sections from omentum.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Hollberg):
A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma of the ovary.  The fimbriae are identified and are involved.  Carcinoma in situ is also present in the fimbriae.  In addition there is adherent full thickness bowel muscularis propria and a diverticulum.
B.  Sections show serous carcinoma.  Much smooth muscle is present in the specimen (?ligament) but no convincing fallopian tube is seen. 
C, D & E.  Sections show extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.
F.  Sections show serous carcinoma in the umbilical deep dermis, subcutis and adherent omentum.
DIAGNOSIS:
Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the left ovary, left fimbriae, omentum, umbilicus, peritoneum and sigmoid.
ADDITIONAL REPORT 27/12/62:
As requested, immunoperoxidase stains for MSI proteins were performed. MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 all show preserved nuclear staining.  This indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
