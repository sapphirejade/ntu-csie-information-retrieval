Distribution:   FILE-COPY
CLINICAL:
Low anterior resection.  Thrombocytopenia post chemo.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Lower anterior resection" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 120mm in length with attached mesenteric fat up to 50mm across.  The distal margin is at the level of anterior peritoneal reflection.  There is a polypoid indurated non-circumferential tumour 22 x 18 x 7mm anteromedial.  The tumour is 55mm from distal margin and is 50mm from proximal margin.  The tumour has a pale cut surface.  Extension into the mesenteric fatty tissue is not seen.  There are several lymph nodes within the mesenteric fatty tissue.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - TS of tumour (block 3 - reserve block); 4 - LS distal margin; 5 - shave proximal margin; 6 -apical lymph node; 7 - lymph nodes as seen; 8 - lymph nodes as seen adjacent to tumour; 9 - lymph nodes as seen. 
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Distal donut" consists of a donut shaped piece of colon bearing mucosa 22 x 15 x 10mm.  The specimen is stapled at one end. 
Blocks: 1- mucosal surface en face.   (FR/ta 1/3/64)

Microscopic Description

Type

Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
The distal donut (specimen B) shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
Residualtumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Response to neoadjuvent therapy
Grade 2 (minimal response) - Residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicatesa low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
The block best for molecular genetic testing is:  A1
