CLINICAL:
Anterior resection mid sigmoid cancer.  Prostate Ca.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "High anterior resection" consists of a segment of colon, 145mm in length.  There is a circumferential, ulcerated tumour situated 45mm from one resection margin (the presumed distal margin).  The tumour measures 35mm long and the overlying serosa is puckered.  The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into mesenteric fat and comes close to the serosal surface.  It measures up to 10mm thick.  Theremainder of the mucosa is unremarkable.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat, from 3 to 12mm.  
Blocks:  1- margins; 2 to 5 - representative tumour; 6 - apical node; 7 to 10 - lymph nodes; 11 - reserve block.(TO: CE; VD/mm 25.3.63)

Maximum tumour diameter:  35mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  45mm
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominantarea
Moderate
Local invasion
pT4a	Tumour penetrates the surface of the visceral peritoneum
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Non-peritonealised circumferential margin:  Not involved
Histological measurement from tumour to non-peritonealised margin:  >10mm
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  22
Number of lymph nodes involved:  8
pN2	Metastases in 4 or more regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Present (Mural  and extramural)
Perineural invasion
Present 
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Residual tumour status
R0	Noresidual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
DIAGNOSIS:
High anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastases (8/22).  pT4a  N2.
