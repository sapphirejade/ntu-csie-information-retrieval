Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Complex pelvic mass.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tube + ovary" consists of a mass 170 x 130 x 80mm with attached fallopian tube 65 x 5mm.  The cut surface shows solid areas up to 75% with abundant mucinous fluid.  The serosal surface of the mass is smooth.  Two representative sections of solid area for frozen section. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - the frozen sections; 3 to 17 - representative sections; 18 - representatives from the fallopian tube.   
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign mucinous tumour in sections sampled.  On further sampling may become borderline.  
Results to Professor Giuffrida by Dr Z Conces at 12.45pm on 8/8/12.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube + ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right fallopian tube and right ovary weighing 55g in total.  The uterus measures 85 x 50 x 25mm and has asmooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 38 x 25mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium is unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter.   The right ovary measures 15 x 10 x 5mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 - representative right fallopian tube; 8 - the right ovary bisected.  
C.  Specimen labelled"Pouch of Douglas" consists of two ragged pieces of haemorrhagic solid tissue measuring 30 x 15 x 10mm and 25 x 7 x 5mm.  Both are serially sliced. 
Blocks: 1 & 2 - the larger piece; 3 - the smaller piece.  AE
D.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid nodule" consists of a tan/red piece of solid tissue 145 x 6 x 5mm.  BAE 1 block.  
E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 80 x 50 x 15mm.  The specimen is serially sliced but no nodules are seen.  
Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections.    (ES/ta 10/11/62)
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Z Bentler):
A.  Further sampling of the ovary subsequent tofrozen section show a tumour with both mucinous and endometrioid components.  The mucinous component varies in appearance from benign to well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The endometrioid componentis that of well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The CK7 stain is positive and the CK20 and CDX2 stains are negative consistent with ovarian primary.  The fallopian tubeshows no significant abnormality.
B.   The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium shows extensive cystic atrophy.  The myometrium shows a small leiomyoma.  The right ovary shows haemorrhagic infarction consistent with recent torsion.  The fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
C & D.  Sections of peritoneum show no evidence of malignancy.  
E.  Sections of the omentum show no evidence of malignancy. 
Representative sections seen by Dr Z Hurt.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A - E.  Bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes, uterus and cervix, peritoneum and omentum:  
- Well differentiated mucinous and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the left ovary.
- Haemorrhagic infarction of right ovary
- Uterus, cervix, peritoneum and omentum show no significant abnormality.
