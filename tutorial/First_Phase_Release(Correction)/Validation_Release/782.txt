CLINICAL:
Adrenal mass with invasion into IVC. 1. left virilising adrenocortical tumour with left kidney; double silk stitch & prolene oversew of left renal vein; silk stitch on renal artery; silk stitch at diaphragmatic margin.  2. Tumour thrombus from IVC.  3. Proximal aspect of tumour thrombus from IVC. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Adrenal cancer", consists of a kidney with attached adrenal mass weighing 660g in total.  The kidney measures 110 x 55 x 52mm.  Abutting the kidney but not appearing to extend into it is a tan/yellow and necrotic tumour measuring 130 x 90 x 65mm.  The cut surface reveals the tumour is dilating a large vein which extends to the renal vein margin.  The tumour appears to also involve the renal vein in a retrograde fashion up into the kidney.  A section of ureter is identified measuring 40mm in length.  The ureter appears uninvolved with tumour.  
Blocks: 1 - renal vein resection margin at suture; 2 - renal artery resection margin at suture; 3 - margin at diaphragm suture; 4 to 7 - further representative tumour; 8 - tumour at dilatation of vein; 9 - tumour to kidney; 10 - tumour in renal vein near kidney; 11 - uninvolved kidney; 12 - ?perihilar nodes; 13 - ureter resection margin; 14 - reserved block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Liver segment four", consists of a piece of liver with capsular surface measuring 16 x 12 x 7mm.  There appears to be a piece of tan tumour attached to the capsular surface measuring 7mm in maximum dimension.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. 
C.  Specimen labelled "Liver segment four", consists of fragments of liver and ?tumour from 1 to 6mm.  Larger pieces are bisected.  AE 1 block. 
D.  Specimen labelled "Liver segment six and seven", consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 16 x 12 x 10mm.  Serially sectioned AE 1 block. 
E.  Specimen labelled "Superior tumour IVC", consists of a piece of tan tissue 5 x 3 x 2mm.  BAE 1 block. 
F.  Specimen labelled "Posterior segment four", consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 15 x 12 x10mm.  Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. 
G.  Specimen labelled "Cava tumour", consists of fragments of heterogeneous tan/yellow tissue from 5 to 55mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.    (TO: DU;SQ/vo 4.9.64) 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Sanden):
A.   Sections show a left adrenal cortical carcinoma which measures 130 x 90 x 65mm and shows large areas of necrosis.  The tumour focally invades the capsuleand is present at the resection margin.  The nuclei are equivalent to Fuhrman grade 3.  No sinus invasion at the periphery of the tumour is seen.  The adrenal tumour is quite separate from the kidney which appears normal.  The tumour invades the renal vein and is present at the renal vein resection margin.  
The tumour cells have a predominantly eosinophilic appearance and there are scattered mitoses.  The five (5) lymph nodes identified at the renal hilum are negative for tumour and there is no abnormality of the proximal ureter.
The Ki67 is about 25% in the worst areas and the tumour shows positive staining for inhibin. The AE1/3 and Hepar 1 are negative as is the chromogranin. The CD56 and synaptophysin are both positive.  
B & C.  Sections show normal liver plus fragments of tumour (segment 4).
D.   Sections show liver in which there is metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma plus detached fragments of carcinoma (segments 6, 7).  
E.   Sections show a fragment of tumour.
F.   Sections show liver tissue plus fragments of tumour (segment 4).
G.   Sections from the inferior vena cava contents show fragments of carcinoma with surrounding thrombus.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:
A-G.   Adrenal tumour plus left kidney, liver mets and caval tumour:
-    Adrenocortical carcinoma, size 130 x 90 x 65mm, capsular invasion with positive
     margin.
-    Invasion of the left renal vein and inferior vena cava.
-    Metastatic carcinoma to liver (segments 4, 6, 7).
