CLINICAL:
HCC.   Liver resection.  Recurrent HCC.  Portal lymph node mass. 
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Lesion intra abdominal tumour", consists of a nodular mass of cream/yellow tissue with small amounts of attached fibrous tissue measuring 95 x 55 x 48mm. Two smaller ? replaced lymph nodes are identifiedmeasuring 18 and 25mm in length. The remainder of the mass shows a ?lymph node almost completely expanded by a cream tumour with prominent areas of necrosis identified.  Block 1 - representative section of two small lymph nodes; 2-4 - representative larger mass. (TO: QG;YB/ec 28.1.62) 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr N Lorah)
The sections of the smaller nodules show metastatic fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma forming a nodule, consistent with metastatic tumour completely replacing a lymph node with a small amount of perinodal spread.  Areas of necrosis are present in the tumour.  The tumour focally abuts the margins of the specimen.  There is another lymph node with reactive features only.
The larger mass shows fibrolamellar carcinoma occupying mostof the specimen, with large areas of necrosis present.  The lesion focally abuts the margins of the specimen. 
The current tumour shows morphological features similar to the previous lesion removed on 13.4.2061 (57Y79447).
CONCLUSION
Liver resection: Recurrent fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.
