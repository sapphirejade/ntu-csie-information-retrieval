CLINICAL:
Grade 3 endometrial cancer, anaemia.  Documented endometrial cancer involving cervix and left parametrium.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries and cervix" consistsof a uterus and adnexa without obvious attached cervix.  Multiple pieces of friable tissue are also present presumed to represent amputated cervix.  The specimen weighs 184g. The uterus measures 80 x 70 x 5mm.  The external surface is shiny and smooth.  On sectioning the endometrial cavity is filled by a soft, tan, fungating and friable tumour.  The endometrium has a maximum thickness of 30mm.  The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 37mm.  The right fallopian tube measures 50 x 5 x 5mm.  The fimbria is present and the external surface is unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 15 x 15 x 5mm and the external surface is unremarkable.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  The left fallopian tube measures 70 x 5 x 5mm and the fimbria is present.  The external surface is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 25 x 15 x 5mm.  The external surface is covered by multiple adhesions.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.  The piecesof soft friable tissue measure in aggregate 70 x 70 x 20mm and weighs in aggregate 75g.  On sectioning areas of necrosis and haemorrhage are identified.  
Blocks: 1 to 5 - one full LS anterior body; 6 & 7 - two representative sections of anterior endomyometrium with tumour; 8 to 14 - one full LS of posterior body (blocks 11 & 12 is a composite of full thickness of endomyometrium with tumour); 15 & 16 - two representative sections of posterior endomyometrium with tumour; 17 - tissue from the tumour selected for tissue bank; 18 - two LS right fimbria; 19 - one TS right ovary, one TS fallopian tube; 20 - two LS left fimbria; 21 - one TS ovary and one TS left fallopian tube; 22 - right parametrial tissue; 23 - left parametrial tissue; 24to 26 - multiple representative sections from the soft friable tissue.   (PG/ta 9/5/62)  
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr S Nute):
Sections show discontigeous grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and cervix.  Within the anterior body of the uterus, tumour invades to a depth of 20mm through a wall thickness of 21mm.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Within the cervix there is almost total destruction of endocervical and ectocervical mucosa with tumour invading the full thicknessof the cervical wall to a thickness of at least 10mm.  Tumour is also present at the cervical resection margin.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.  
DIAGNOSIS:  
Uterus, tubes, ovaries and cervix:  
- Discontigeous grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of endometrium and cervix.
- Myometrial invasion to a depth of 20mm through a wall thickness of 21mm.
- Extensive involvement of endocervix and ectocervix.
- Positive paracervical and cervical resection margin.
