ADDITIONAL REPORT (10/9/63)

CLINICAL:
Left invasive breast x 2.  10 o'clock 6cm fn.  3 o'clock 6cm fn.  Multicentric ca.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left sentinel node" consists of a lymph node 10 x 5 x 5mm.   AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Breast, left breast stitch axilla" consists of a mastectomy with a stitch axilla measuring 20mm (medial to lateral) x 170 (superior to inferior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  No skin is identified.  A fibrotic and irregular area is identified ?retro areola tissue.  Specimen is inked blue anterior margin, black posterior margin.  On sectioning and at 10 o'clock 6cm from nipple there is a stellate fibrotic and hard tumour measuring 20 x 20 x 15mm and is located 5mm from the deep margin, 15mm from the superficial margin,  30mm from superior margin and 100mm from the inferior margin.  A second fibrotic and ill defined areais identified at 3 o'clock 60mm from nipple measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm and is located 15mm from the deep margin, 10mm from the superficial margin and more than 60mm from the superior and inferior margin.  The rest of the parenchyma has a fibrofatty appearance.  At 6 o'clock 80mm from the nipple there is a nodular and firm and haemorrhagic area 10 x 10 x 5mm.  
Blocks: 1 - retro areolar area; 2 & 3 - composite of 10 o'clock tumour with superficial and deep margin; 4 & 5 - 10 o'clock tumour with deep margin; 6 & 7 - fibrotic ill defined area from 6 o'clock with superficial and deep margin; 8 & 9 - representative sections of 3 o'clock irregular area with superficial margin; 10 - 3 o'clockirregular area with deep margin; 11 & 12 - upper inner quadrant; 13 & 14 - lower inner quadrant; 15 & 16 - upper outer quadrant; 17 & 18 - lower outer quadrant, 19 - lower inner quadrant.   (DQ/ta  27/8/63)  

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Mcdevitt):
A and B. There are 2 separate invasive ductal carcinomas, tumour 1 at 10 o'clock 6cm from nipple and tumour 2 at 3 o'clock, 6cm from nipple. High grade DCIS measuring 120mm is seen bridging the 2 lesions.
